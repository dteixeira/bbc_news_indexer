      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <title>'Crimes committed' for home priority</title>
      <description>Some people might be committing minor crimes to get priority housing when they are released from prison, BBC Wales learns.</description>

      <body>Some people might be committing minor crimes to get priority housing when they are released from prison, BBC Wales has learned. In Wales all prisoners are automatically put on a priority list if they are homeless when released, regardless of how long they spent behind bars. It costs Welsh councils £2m a year to house former prisoners. Now Housing Minister Carl Sargeant wants to change the law. In 2001 the Welsh government changed the law to allow homeless ex-prisoners with friends or family in an area to access priority housing in a bid to stop them reoffending. But the Welsh government said this had not worked and it now wanted to make the system harder to abuse. Recent figures show there is a larger proportion of former prisoners on priority lists (14%) than people fleeing domestic violence (11%), people with a mental illness or learning disability (6%) or those leaving care or the armed forces (2%). There is no minimum on how long someone has to spend behind bars so a person could be held on remand for a week, be released and then a council has a duty to house them. "I think if you look hard enough you'll find anything you wish to look for in terms of loopholes in systems," said Housing Minister Mr Sargeant. "I'm sure there will be people out there who would have committed a small crime to do actually that. "The fact of the matter is a person in your local community, waiting on the housing list or homeless, at the moment... is in a worse position than somebody who has just left a prison establishment." Former prisoner Craig Lewis, 23, has spent time in prison for assault, car theft and dangerous driving. With the help of friends and family he now has a place to live and a full-time job. But like many former prisoners he is aware of a practice where people in desperate situations commit minor crimes in a bid to jump the housing queue. "Repeat offenders, they usually offend repeatedly so they can get on the priority list," he said. "Seasonal offenders through the winter, they'll commit as many offences as they can just so they'll get a roof over their head in prison and then they'll be out in two or three months with a flat or maybe in a house with their families." Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP Elfyn Llwyd, who sits on the justice select committee, said if the practice was happening then it underlined there was a crisis in the public housing sector in Wales. "I appreciate that a person who has been in prison does need somewhere to live otherwise he or she might reoffend fairly quickly," he said. "Having said that it does seem to me to be a rather blunt instrument... and I hope the Welsh government and the National Assembly for Wales will review this policy in light of this rather strange finding." </body>

      <title>Changes agreed to European club rugby</title>
      <description>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian unions agree to change the structure of European club rugby.</description>

      <body>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian governing bodies have agreed to change the structure of European club rugby. After meetings in Dublin, they agreed on the formation of two tweaked competitions of 20 teams each as well as a change in revenue distribution. But top English and French clubs, who have proposed a breakaway competition from next season, were not present. The Anglo-French plan has been backed by the four Welsh regions. Premiership Rugby (PRL) in England and Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR) in France say they will have no involvement in the Heineken Cup or Amlin Challenge Cup from next season. Instead of competing in European Rugby Cup (ERC) competitions, the PRL and LNR plan to form an alternative Rugby Champions Cup. Details of this competition could be rolled out next month. PRL and LNR are unhappy at how teams qualify for the Heineken Cup, especially from the RaboDirect Pro12 league, and how proceeds are shared. Currently, only the top six clubs in England and France are guaranteed a place in the Heineken Cup, whereas at least 10 Pro12 outfits - including both Scottish teams (Edinburgh and Glasgow), both Italian teams (Treviso and Zebre) and a minimum of three sides each from Wales and Ireland - have automatic entry into the competition. As part of the new proposals, only seven clubs from the Pro12 would qualify for the primary tournament. In addition, the revenue would be split evenly between the three leagues - the English Premiership, France's Top 14 and the Pro12 - as proposed by English and French clubs in June of last year. But PRL said Thursday's developments offer "no more than half a solution" to the crisis. "It seems that the proposals we have made on competition formats and on financial distribution have been accepted," said its chief executive Mark McCafferty. "Hopefully, it is a sign that in due course the whole approach we've been proposing is bought into. I guess time will tell. "It is far from complete, but the pieces they have commented on are in line with what we've proposed. "We have always said that there is no way we are going into any competitions that are run by ERC after the end of this season. That hasn't changed. "We feel a fresh start has got to be made." Remaining stumbling blocks are the rival television broadcasting deals between Sky and BT and the insistence of English and French outfits that clubs should run European competitions, rather than the unions. Representatives from the Rugby Football Union, French Rugby Federation, Scottish Rugby Union, Welsh Rugby Union, Irish Rugby Union and Italian Rugby Federation were all present in Dublin. They issued a statement which read: "Progress has been made on a number of issues relating to the future of European club rugby competition. "The primary competition would be made up of 20 clubs, with six each from PRL and the LNR, and seven from the Pro12 tournament. "The clubs would come through meritocratic qualification from their respective leagues and, in the case of the Pro12, there will be at least one club guaranteed from each country. "In year one, the 20th place would be allocated through a play-off match between the seventh-placed PRL and LNR clubs. "The secondary competition would consist of up to 20 clubs made up of the remaining 18 PRL, LNR and Pro12 clubs. Two places could be allocated to clubs qualifying from a third competition. "There is also consensus that distributable revenues generated through the competitions would be divided one third, one third, one third per league with the stipulation that monies to be received by the Pro12 countries would not be less than the current levels." The PRL, the LNR and the four Welsh regions have not yet been consulted on the proposals and it is unclear who will run these proposed European club competitions from next year. </body>

      <title>Parents urged to act over measles</title>
      <description>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading.</description>

      <body>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases linked to a Pontardawe school had risen to 13, while a case had been reported at a Swansea nursery. This outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. PHW said it was "very frustrated". "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe school but also in two primary schools, a further education college and a nursery," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW's consultant in communicable disease control. "In all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles." Health officials have already written to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. Pupils were offered the MMR vaccination with 55 children immunised during the school session but at least 46 did not take up the offer. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year. "We are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 12. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. </body>

      <title>Ex-football chief executive jailed</title>
      <description>The former chief executive of Wrexham FC, Paul Retout, is jailed for 16 months for a £60,000 fraud involving a firm in London.</description>

      <body>The former chief executive of Wrexham FC, Paul Retout, has been given a 16-month jail sentence for a £60,000 fraud. Retout, 53, admitted submitting false invoices to London-based company Quadrangle Group in 2007 and 2008 while a partner with the firm. Kingston Crown Court heard that he had started at the group in 1989 as a financial controller. He stepped down from Wrexham football club in 2010. The court was told on Thursday that Retout made claims for work he had not done, blaming his "chaotic" family life after moving to north Wales. "You were not acting dishonestly from the outset, but you became dishonest when you later invoiced and obtained money for work you had not done and for which you were not entitled, money obtained from the partnership," Judge Nicholas Jones told Retout. The judge said he also accepted that the ex-football club boss, who had his family home in Ruthin in Denbighshire, had shown remorse for his actions. Retout is also expecting to be stripped of his professional standing as a chartered accountant, the court heard. He pleaded guilty to committing fraud by abuse of position at a court hearing last month. The court was told that Retout obtained £59,806 as result of his fake invoices, and also carrying out work which had not been authorised in advance by the firm. A civil legal case with Quadrangle has been settled, and Retout has also made part-repayment of the defrauded money. </body>

      <title>'Care failings' over student death</title>
      <description>A health trust admits care failings after a teenager with a history of mental health problems killed herself at Trinity St David's university.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted failings in the care of an 18-year-old Kent student with a history of mental health problems who killed herself. Lauren Smith, of Canterbury, was found dead at the University in Wales Trinity St David's Lampeter campus in 2012. Her mother, Laura Smith, said she had been left "heartbroken" and did not want the situation to be repeated. Kent and Medway NHS Trust said a review found "more could have been done" to support her transfer to Wales. Lauren, who had a history of self-harming, was weeks into the first year of her humanities degree when she took her own life at the university halls of residence in Lampeter on 17 November 2012. Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton recorded a verdict of suicide while suffering severe depressive illness, at an inquest into her death in Aberystwyth. The inquest was told she was not getting the mental health care she should have been receiving. Ms Smith said there was a lack of support for teenagers with a history of mental health and they were at risk of "slipping through the cracks" when they turned 18, left home or moved to university. She added: "I was given a false sense of security by assuming risk assessments were being carried out, that my concerns as her mother were being recorded, and that information and records were being shared between agencies. "There seems to be complacency among mental health professionals when it comes to adolescent mental health - for instance, I was told by one hospital psychiatrist that lots of teenage girls harm themselves, it doesn't mean they're going to do anything." She added: "There were many opportunities for the outcome to have been different for Lauren. "We will never know this for sure, but I hope that other vulnerable young people and their families can be spared the additional agony of what ifs? by ensuring that further deaths of those slipping through the cracks - as they transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Adult Services - are prevented." A spokeswoman for Kent and Medway NHS Trust said: "Following Lauren's death the trust conducted an immediate review of the care provided. The initial investigation concluded that record-keeping in the case was below the expected standard and the arrangements for transferring care to Wales should have been better managed. "Further review has highlighted that more could have been done to gather information from other mental health services that had seen Lauren in the past." In a statement, Hywel Dda Health Board said it had contacted Ms Smith's family "to explain that the appropriate referral to local mental health services was made for Lauren whilst she was resident in our area". A spokesman for the University in Wales Trinity St David said it had a comprehensive range of support services for students in place, which included mental health advisers, mentors and counsellors. "These services are provided as soon as the university is made aware of any support needs that our students might have," he said. He added that the university students' union also provided a student welfare service and a night-time listening service. </body>

      <title>Extra funding for Wales from HS2</title>
      <description>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury concedes.</description>

      <body>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury has conceded. It had initially rejected Finance Minister Jane Hutt's announcement that Wales would get extra cash stemming from spending on the project in 2015. But the spending commitment of around £35m in that year is not guaranteed for the lifetime of the project. The Treasury suggested it may change the funding formula in the future. HS2 is a controversial new high speed rail link proposed to run from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033, at an estimated cost of £42.5bn. UK government ministers have always maintained that the project is of UK-wide significance. This would mean the devolved nations should not get extra payments which are normally due to them for transport projects in England. The 2015 extra cash will put pressure on the Treasury to maintain the payments throughout the next decade - which could bring in up to £2bn for the Welsh budget. But the Chancellor is able to change the funding formula at his discretion, which means that in future years the system could be adjusted to exclude any additional cash for Wales. The Welsh government is likely to campaign strongly to continue to receive the extra funding beyond 2015. It confirmed it had received a share of £832m to be spent on the HS2 scheme by the Department for Transport in 2015-16. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the Welsh government was "very clear" on the matter. She said that this episode demonstrated how the way the Welsh government is funded "needs reform". The Welsh government receives a slice of the extra money that is spent in England on services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, what is known as "Barnett consequentials". That process would normally include transport spending, but Treasury officials had always maintained Wales would not get more cash as a result of extra spending on HS2 because they say the project benefits the entire UK. The issue of Wales receiving part of this money has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee on Monday - where she informed members of the extra cash coming to Wales - was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. She told AMs there would be £84m extra in 2015-16, because of a £2bn increase in the Department for Transport's overall budget, which includes £832m spent on HS2. A Treasury spokesperson said the Welsh government had received a "capital consequential" of £84.5m. "This was based on a £2bn increase in the total Department for Transport capital budget," said the Treasury. Figures obtained by the BBC under a freedom of information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people attended a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed £180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <body>Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips's future at French club Bayonne is in doubt. Bayonne confirmed to BBC Wales that Phillips remains suspended over an alleged breach of discipline. The club have also condemned  media reports in France  claiming the 31-year-old player had been sacked. Bayonne say no decision has been taken yet on Phillips' future, but confirmed he will remain absent when they host Montpellier on Friday. Phillips appeared before the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations he turned up to a video analysis session under the influence of alcohol. Fellow players Dwayne Haare and Stephen Brett also had to answer allegations at that meeting, and were fined but not suspended. National coach Warren Gatland has said the 77-times capped player will not face punishment by Wales. Phillips was suspended by Bayonne last year, for off-field misconduct, and by Wales in July 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre when he was involved in a confrontation with a doorman. The former Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys player joined Bayonne following the World Cup in the autumn of 2011. He was a key member of the Lions team that beat Australia 2-1 in the Test series last summer, setting up the opening try for Alex Corbisiero in the decisive third-Test victory in Sydney. Phillips also won Six Nations Grand Slams with Wales in 2008 and 2012. </body>

      <body>A main road in Snowdonia closed after a landslip covered it in about 30 tonnes of debris has reopened. The A498 was shut both ways on Wednesday between Beddgelert and Penygwryd while the carriageway was cleared. Officers used specialised equipment to remove the debris from the road, which now has temporary traffic lights in place. The landslip happened following a prolonged spell of heavy rain. A spokesman for the council said: "As part of the initial safety works on the site, concrete safety barriers are being installed. "The traffic management system will remain in place until further stabilisation work is completed at the site. "The council is currently making attempts to contact the relevant landowner before these additional safety works are carried out." The council has also spoken to the organisers of the Snowdonia Marathon, which takes place in the area on Saturday, who say the route will not be affected. </body>

      <body>The proposed merger of two Denbighshire Catholic schools could be put on hold as councillors consider a new option. It had been proposed that St Brigid's in Denbigh and Blessed Edward Jones in Rhyl should close, to be replaced by a new multi-faith school on two sites. Instead, Denbighshire councillors will be asked to consider working with the Anglican and Catholic diocese to create a single site on an undecided location. The council's cabinet will vote on the proposal at a meeting next week. More than 1,300 people responded to a consultation, which showed very little support for the original proposals. A new, single site would mean the closure of both existing faith schools, possibly by 2018. Anna Gresty, of St Brigid's Action Group, said: "Having read the council's summary of responses to this consultation, we weren't surprised at the overwhelming response against the proposals to merge St Brigid's School and Blessed Edward Jones as one school 12 miles apart." Tony Hannigan, chair of governors at St Brigid's School, said: "St Brigid's School is very pleased to have been told in a meeting with Denbighshire County Council officers, that they have listened to our concerns and will recommend councillors drop plans for a 'one school on two sites' model involving St Brigid's and Blessed Edward Jones in 2014." However, he said there was concern that plans to build a new school, adding that it would "represent much greater value for money for the taxpayer to use the existing sites and build on their successes". Earlier this year, pupils at St Brigid's made on online film to campaign to keep the school as it is. </body>

      <title>Wales pool pulled as Paralympic base</title>
      <description>National Pool no longer base for elite Paralympic swimmers</description>

      <body>The Wales National Pool will no longer be the base for elite Paralympic swimmers, the sport's governing body has announced. British Swimming will relocate athletes to Manchester in a move to centralise training after what was seen as a poor performance at London 2012. The Swansea pool board has asked the Welsh and UK governments, along with UK Sport, to get the decision reversed. Its chair Anne Ellis has called it a "significant blow". The Swansea pool has produced medal winning swimmers such as Ellie Simmonds and Dave Roberts. The Manchester pool will be known as the National Performance Centre and the body's new head coach, Rob Greenwood, took up his role on Monday. British Swimming said the move north will give athletes greater levels of support. National performance director Chris Furber said: "A review took place to ensure that we were providing athletes with the best support and services within their daily training environments. "The decision was made, as we move forwards towards Rio [2016 Games], we would have one national performance centre where we will have the very best support and services that athletes require. "We will continue to work with Swim Wales regarding the support that athletes receive in Wales and how we can also support their talent programmes." The South Wales Evening Post newspaper quoted a letter from the Wales National Pool's chairwoman Anne Ellis to politicians. It read: "The decision to stop using the excellent pool facilities in Swansea as a base for elite Paralympics swimming is a significant blow to disability sport provision in Wales." She added this was "particularly disappointing not only because of the exceptional track record developed by Swansea, but also it now means that all elite Paralympic swimmers from Wales will have to travel to Manchester if they want to be in the GB National Squad. "This also means the pool loses out on income from elite training and the coaching excellence developed in the field of Paralympics swimming is under threat." British Swimming's budget was cut after the London Olympics. A spokesperson for Sport Wales said: "Our central focus continues to be that talented Welsh swimmers are able to reach their potential and have access to high level coaching and support. We will be discussing how Swim Wales and British Swimming can achieve this with the help of our investment and resources." Swim Wales said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision. "Of course we understand that difficult decisions have to be made on how to use limited funding, but the results achieved from Swansea consistently over a number of years speak for themselves, including performances at London 2012 and the recent IPC World Championships. "There is still a key role for Swansea and Swim Wales to play in the disability swimming performance pathway. Discussions are ongoing on how the centre at Swansea fits into these plans leading to the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games." </body>

      <title>Festival should 'continue to travel'</title>
      <description>The National Eisteddfod should continue to travel around Wales rather than moving to fixed bases, says a task force considering its future.</description>

      <body>The National Eisteddfod should continue to travel around Wales, says a task force that has been considering its future. Chaired by broadcaster Roy Noble, the group of 12 members opposed the festival establishing permanent bases. But their report said each eisteddfod should "experiment, better reflecting the area it is visiting". Eisteddfod chief executive Elfed Roberts welcomed the report and said it would be considered carefully. The National Eisteddfod is one of Europe's largest cultural and artistic festivals. Established by the Welsh government in 2012, the task-and-finish group looking at the event's future included Hay Festival director Peter Florence and Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas AM. The biggest proposed change would have meant having a four-year cycle for the festival. In two of the years it would have been held in two different permanent bases, while during the other two years it would continue as now moving between north and south Wales to temporary homes. During this year's eisteddfod in Denbighshire, First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary David Jones both publicly supported the idea that it should remain a travelling festival. The report came to the same conclusion but recommended the appointment of a new artistic director "to attract visitors from all corners of the world". The eisteddfod receives about £500,000 from the Welsh government towards the £3.6m cost of staging the event. Mr Roberts said: "We welcome the publication of the group's report and will consider its content carefully. "This is an independent report on the eisteddfod, commissioned by the former minister for education and skills, and we look forward to receiving the government's response to its content and recommendations in due course. "This response and the report itself will be presented to the management board and the council of the eisteddfod, and following internal discussions we will publish our response to the report." </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <body>People moving into Wales should be more tolerant of the wishes of local people who support wind turbines, an AM says. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the chair of the assembly's environment committee, was commenting on bitter rows about wind energy plans on the Llyn peninsula. As part of a BBC Wales Taro 9 investigation he says some incomers should "learn to work with" locals. But opponents of turbines say they would be as destructive as the flooding of valleys to create reservoirs. The programme being shown on S4C examines wind turbine developments and proposals on the Llyn Peninsula. Lord Elis-Thomas, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, believes more green energy should be produced, and people moving to Wales should not object so strongly. He told the programme: "I've noticed that there are a number of people who have moved into Wales who vocally oppose stopping Wales developing natural resources and I think this is something very serious. "Because if people move to an area to live, they must learn to work with the people in that area and the economy of this area is vitally important to us all." While some claim wind turbines benefit local communities, the programme also hears from opponents like Sian Parri of the Friends of Llyn Society. She likens wind turbines to the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in the 1960s to provide water to Liverpool. "They say that this is our Tryweryn, and there is no sadder sight in my mind in the history of Wales than that small group of people running down that hill after Celyn Valley had been drowned," she said. "And it will be very sad to come to the Llyn in a few years time with the place destroyed and the views ruined." Others say the divisive issue has far-reaching consequences for a usually tight-knit community. "It's already split long-standing friendships and family ties," said Steve Dorling from Llanaelhaearn. "I can't imagine this proposal is any different to others on the peninsula. "It's very sad when kids that went to school together and are now in their forties and fifties no longer speak and that's the case." Taro 9 can be seen on S4C on Tuesday 22 October 2013 at 21:30 BST </body>

      <body>People planning to go walking in Snowdonia as the half-term holidays approach have been warned to be prepared for the dark. MountainSafe, which represents rescuers and other agencies, said people were getting caught out as nights drew in. A group of 30 walkers recently needed help from mountain rescue teams when one of them got injured after dark. One warden said many did not consider the length of their journey before starting and did not carry torches. Dewi Davies, Snowdonia National Park senior warden, said: "Lack of preparation is the reason behind the majority of calls to rescue teams at this time of year. "Walkers don't consider the length of their journey before starting and they don't consider that it gets much darker earlier these days. "They don't have a torch or a torch that's working and relying on a mobile phone isn't a good idea either." In the recent incident, the group of walkers did not begin their ascent of Snowdon from Llanberis until 14:00 BST. Mountain rescuers were called out at 21:30 BST when one of the group injured an ankle while coming down a rocky path in darkness. When rescuers arrived, they discovered not all the group had torches with them. MountainSafe has issued a five-point checklist for walkers: British Summer Time ends on Sunday, when turning the clocks back an hour will make it appear dark earlier. MountainSafe includes representatives from Snowdonia National Park Authority, North Wales Police, North Wales Mountain Rescue Association, the RAF, Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team and other agencies. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Future of pavilion still undecided</title>

      <body>The future of a Denbighshire town's community building remains undecided with campaigners vowing to fight plans that would see it demolished. Corwen Pavilion closed in March 2010 because of health and safety issues. Repairs were estimated at £1.3m and Denbighshire council planned to demolish it and pass the land to a community group to build a new venue. But the demolition was delayed by a court injunction and the council will now discuss the issue next month. Campaigners from Save the Pavilion say the building has played an important part in Welsh culture throughout the 20th Century. It has hosted several concerts and Welsh cultural festivals. The issue has now been placed back on the council agenda after being held up by legal discussions and other issues. Builder Esmor Davies, a member of the Save the Pavilion group, said: "Nine or 10 months has gone and nothing has been done about it. "It's appalling," he said, adding that the delay would only worsen the condition of the building. Demolition was due in April 2011 but it was delayed by a court injunction to give the campaign group time to come up with a viable financial plan for the building. A court hearing was then due to be held in December 2011 but delayed due to a lack of consent from the Charity Commission. The commission has confirmed it has consulted with Denbighshire council regarding demolition. The council in its role of trustee is now due to discuss the issue again at a cabinet meeting at the end of November. It will then be up to the courts early next year to make a decision. A spokesperson for Denbighshire council said if the court was to side with county officials then demolition could take place as soon as possible. Councillor Huw Jones said the issue should have been sorted some time ago. "It's a dangerous building," he said. "It needs to be resolved as soon as possible." He said Denbighshire council was committed to help provide a new building and that the authority "would not walk away". </body>

      <body>Two masked men who terrified a family in their own home during an early morning burglary have been jailed. Mold Crown Court heard they punched one woman in the face, threatened her and two others at knifepoint, and tried to stab a man with a screwdriver. Heroin addicts Colin Maher 31, and Michael Rhodes, 33, from Rhyl, admitted aggravated burglary at the house in Kinmel Bay. Jailing them for eight years, a judge said it was "the stuff of nightmares". "It understandably had a profound effect on the victims," Judge Rhys Rowlands added. "This was truly a terrifying ordeal at the hands of the two of you." Prosecutor David Mainstone told the court how 20-year-old Chantelle Palmer was staying the night with her parents and a 17-year-old girl was also present. In the early hours of 14 May, Miss Palmer was woken by a bang to find two men in the room - one had a hood covering most of his face and the other had a scarf covering his lower face. Both were wearing gloves, and one stood over her bed three feet away. The intruder looked at her and told her to give him money but she said she did not have any. He then held an eight-inch knife to her throat and again demanded money. Mr Mainstone said the burglar punched her, but she bravely hit him back and there was a struggle. While that was going on, a young woman aged 17 in the same bedroom was woken up to find a knife being held to her throat by the other man. "The knife was thrust at her five times before he punched out at her but she pulled her head away and they didn't connect," Mr Mainstone explained. She heard the first knifeman say that "his boys are outside". Miss Palmer's parents heard a commotion and entered the room. Her mother Ananka Palmer saw a man holding a knife at her daughter and then she "felt an arm and something cold across her neck". "She realised a knife was being held across her throat," said Mr Mainstone. "She pushed the man away with both hands, hard, she saw his face was covered and was terrified. She ran out of the room and was shaking." Her husband Carl Palmer grabbed hold of one of the knifemen and they struggled with each other. The intruder then lunged at Mr Palmer with a screwdriver in a stabbing motion but the householder was able to grab the attacker's throat to prevent him being stabbed, the court heard. It was at that stage that Miss Palmer took the screwdriver away from the attacker and her father was able to pull him out of the house. The burglars then fled in a stolen car. The defendants had been drinking before the burglary, their barristers said. Maher received an additional 18 months in jail for possessing heroin with intent to supply. </body>

      <body>Police have issued a warning against anti-social behaviour over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period. Trick or treaters are urged to only knock doors where welcome posters - available from police - are displayed. Officers are contacting shops about the sale of eggs and flour over Halloween, and are also warning about firework dangers. Patrols will be stepped up and Dyfed-Powys Police said it would react quickly to any anti-social behaviour. The force is working with the fire service and local authorities as part of the "Be a Nice Guy" (B.A.N.G.) campaign. Sgt Mark McSweeney said: "We know that instances of anti-social behaviour can increase at this time of year and some communities can suffer more than others. "Also fireworks in the wrong hands can cause misery as they are used to damage property as well as threaten or injure people." He added: "While Halloween can undoubtedly be a great deal of fun, it can also be a particularly distressing time of year for some of the more vulnerable members of our communities - especially the elderly. "Trick or treaters are therefore being urged to only knock on doors where the poster is displayed." Trick or treat posters can be obtained by calling neighbourhood policing teams on 101. </body>

      <body>Villagers are concerned a planned pylon route linking wind farms to the national power supply could spoil the view from a local hill. Drop-in sessions are being staged by National Grid over the 25-mile (40km) route in Powys and Shropshire until 8 November. In Llanymynech, near Welshpool, people said they feared the pylons could ruin the views across the two counties. National Grid said it was "one of the main things" concerning people. A spokeswoman said National Grid "fully understands" people's concerns in Llanymynech, adding: "That's why we're holding these events, to hear people's opinions." The pylon route would start from an electricity sub-station in Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, and finish at the national transmission network near Oswestry in Shropshire. In addition to the pylons, National Grid has said eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables will be buried underground in the Meifod valley. The first of 26 drop-in sessions in Powys and Shropshire started on 7 October. Revealing its pylon plans in September, National Grid said a new "T-pylon" - which is about 15m (nearly 50ft) shorter than conventional pylons - could be used along the power cable route which would be 33 miles (53km) long. It said it had developed a draft route to keep away from villages and would use "hills and trees as a natural backdrop to help keep any visual impact to a minimum". The remaining drop-in sessions start next week at West Felton Village Hall, near Oswestry, and at Meifod Village Hall, near Welshpool. </body>

      <body>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm have been suspended. It follows complaints from ResQNet customers that they had been left with a patchy and inconsistent service. The Cross Hands company has received almost £900,000 in public cash from a government scheme to provide high-speed internet access in so-call 'not-spots'. ResQNet vowed to upgrade its network by the end of October. Grants for other broadband providers are not affected. The firm received funding as part of the Wales Broadband Support Scheme, which makes £1,000 grants available to households unable to access broadband connections. The money is typically paid directly to suppliers, so residents do not have to pay up front for equipment and connection costs. Customers from various parts of Carmarthenshire have told BBC Wales they were promised broadband connection speeds of around 5Mbps by ResQNet, but say they have faced a disrupted and a patchy service in recent months. John Sydney, from Taliaris near Llandeilo, said he had now cancelled his subscription to ResQNet because of his frustration with the service. He said he was pleased with the internet speed initially being provided by ResQNet, but then the broadband connection deteriorated around six months ago. "We've had very, very slow speeds and a lot of disconnections," he said. "It's on and off all the time. All of a sudden you couldn't do things online... it was quite frustrating." He said the Welsh government "should be checking on the supplier... to make sure he's fulfilling his part of the contract". Another customer, Roger Thomas, from Cwmdu near Llandeilo, has gone back to using an old, and slower service, because he said ResQNet was too unreliable. "£24 pounds a months is a lot of money for a service that doesn't work," he said. BBC Wales has been made aware of more problems with services in the village of Llanedi, between Cross Hands and Pontarddulais. ResQNet's own website indicates a series of technical problems and upgrades to the service, while a Facebook page has been set up by frustrated ResQNet customers. The company declined to be interviewed by BBC Wales, but in a statement said work would soon be completed to increase network capacity and upgrades to the wireless network. ResQNet director Clive Downey said that the internet usage they were experiencing was "was way beyond what we expected". In its statement, the company added: "We appreciate there have been service issues on parts of our network due to the increased need for bandwidth combined with the success of the service. "The planned increase in the capacity of the network has been delayed but its implementation by the end of October will help alleviate the current issues for the customers affected. ResQNet said it was a "small, innovative business" that over the last two-and-a-half years had provided broadband services where other "major players have failed". "We are committed to continue this trend and overcome the obstacles that will come along from time to time by continued investment and innovation and provide broadband users in west Wales with real choices," it added. "We are also more aware of its limitations and our business strategy will now reflect this new found knowledge whilst being very aware of the importance this service is to the areas concerned. The company said customers affected by the current issues would be compensated under the terms of their contract, and some had already been paid. The Welsh government said it was "unacceptable" that customers had been let down, after it had paid £892,000 in grants to residents and businesses who had identified ResQNet as their broadband service provider. A Welsh government spokesperson said it was working with ResQNet to ensure it fulfilled contractual obligations, adding that there was a "mechanism to recover funding under certain circumstances". </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Wales' Harris wary of Italy threat</title>
      <description>Wales must be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup, warns boss Iestyn Harris.</description>

      <body>Head coach Iestyn Harris says Wales will have to be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup on Saturday. The Italians beat England 15-14 at the weekend and Harris said the result should serve as a warning to Wales for the game at the Millennium Stadium. He said: "We knew about the quality of the Italians and we knew they would be a formidable task in our first game. "I think the result they had against England confirmed that." The Group C/D match will be Wales' third game at stadium where they the lost to New Zealand in the 2000 World Cup and then again in 2002. "Italy are a very, very good team and they've got a lot of experience in there [and] they've got a lot of NRL experience in there," added Harris. "They are an extremely difficult team to play against and anything outside our best won't be good enough to win that game." England face Australia in Saturday's opening game of the tournament in Cardiff followed by Wales' clash with Italy. Harris is relishing a return to the venue and says a successful World Cup campaign could help the game's popularity in Wales. "To have a game at the Millennium Stadium for a Wales rugby league national side is certainly important to us," Harris said. "I'm sure the players who take the field will be immensely proud of the fact we're at the Millennium Stadium. "If we hit the ground running and get some momentum behind us then all of a sudden the Welsh public will start to get behind us. "That could kick off the sport [and] ultimately we've got that responsibility." </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people attended a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed £180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <title>Jones backs halting winter surgery</title>
      <description>First Minister Carwyn Jones backs plans to suspend some non-urgent surgery in four hospitals in mid and west Wales over the winter.</description>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <title>WRU to make central contracts offer</title>
      <description>The WRU offers to employ Welsh regions' star players amid financial uncertainty caused by a row over European rugby's future.</description>

      <body>The Welsh Rugby Union has offered to help the four regions keep their leading Welsh players in Wales. The WRU would employ all of the regions' leading Wales players whose deals expire in 2014. Wales captain Sam Warburton is among those out of contract next summer. "It is important that any player considering his future right now fully understands the level of support the WRU is prepared to offer," said WRU chief executive Roger Lewis. The governing body said regions had expressed concerns about their ability to conclude their own negotiations with leading players amid uncertainty over the future of the principal European club competition, the Heineken Cup. The WRU adds that once the negotiations regarding the European tournament are concluded the agreed player contracts would revert to the regions. Its offer came as a European Rugby Cup Limited (ERC) meeting for stakeholders was taking place in Dublin on Wednesday, a meeting representatives of the English and French clubs said they would boycott. BBC Wales Sport understands that Stuart Gallacher, the chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales, the umbrella organisation for the Welsh regions, did not attend the meeting either. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons have publicly backed Anglo-French plans for a new European competition. They claim the revamped tournament offers "significant advantages", but the WRU opposes the new European competition. Players' agent Tim Lopez, who represents Wales and Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny, has already warned that some players are waiting to see what happens before deciding their futures. Halfpenny and Cardiff Blues and international team-mate Warburton are out of contract at the end of the season. Scarlets captain Jonathan Davies plus Ospreys trio Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Jones and Ian Evans are also out of contract in the summer. Lock Evans has stated he would consider leaving the region if they were not competing in the Heineken Cup. A number of leading players have left Wales in recent seasons to join richer French and English clubs and the WRU wants to ensure more do not follow. "I want to make it clear to our players that we have full confidence in the future of the elite game in Wales," WRU chief Lewis added. "It would be inappropriate to go into details about any negotiations or discussions which rightly have to be concluded in private. "But I respect the concerns of the players at a time when our talks on Europe are continuing. "Our squad is about to embark on a demanding autumn series of international games and it is vitally important all of their minds are completely focused on the task in hand. "I shared this proposal with the regional chairmen on Monday of this week and look forward to what I expect would be a positive response." </body>

      <description>Swansea City cannot be complacent against winless Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa League, warns manager Michael Laudrup.</description>

      <body>Michael Laudrup says Swansea City cannot be complacent against Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa League. Swansea lead Group A with two wins out of two and host winless Russian side Krasnodar on Thursday. A third win would put the Swans on the verge of sealing a place in the last 32, but Laudrup says his side will have to be at their best. "You play in Europe and if you're not 100% you can lose. It's so easy," Laudrup said. Wins over Valencia and St Gallen have put Swansea in a strong position while Krasnodar have not won in their last nine games in all competitions. But despite their opponents' recent struggles, Swans boss Laudrup says Krasnodar cannot not be taken lightly. "If you're not playing your best or nearly your best it's difficult against anyone," said Laudrup. "This team is not a bad team. They have some good players." Laudrup, who had a spell in Russia as Spartak Moscow coach, says victory at the Liberty Stadium would be another step towards qualifying for the last 32. The Welsh side face Krasnodar in the return match on 7 November before games against St Gallen away and Valencia at home in December. "We're at home, we'll be favourites and we're top of the group and want to win for a lot of reasons," Laudrup added. "The first is that getting to nine points will give us one foot, maybe one and a half feet, in the knock-out stage. "After this game we have two difficult away games. "We go to Russia with all the travelling and the time difference, and then Switzerland where there will be cold weather. "We also have Valencia at home so this is a key game for us. "I think 10 points should be enough to get us through, but we might need 11." </body>

      <body>Prop Adam Jones drops to the bench for the Ospreys' Pro12 clash against Welsh rivals Newport Gwent Dragons on Friday. Jones' Wales rival Aaron Jarvis comes in at tight-head. The hosts also switch Dan Biggar from fly-half to full-back in Richard Fussell's absence with a back injury and Matthew Morgan starts at 10. Dragons are boosted by skipper Andrew Coombs' return from injury at lock, but fly-half Jason Tovey (concussion) is out. Adam Jones' demotion comes amid five starting changes to the side that took the field in their 27-16 Heineken Cup defeat at Northampton. Biggar's move to full-back adds to the Ospreys' fresh look. Jonathan Spratt comes into midfield for Ashley Beck, while Ryan Jones and Joe Bearman make way in the back-row for Tyler Ardron and Morgan Allen. Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy said: "Obviously we are disappointed about Sunday but a game like this one is the perfect way for us to pick ourselves up and go again. "This group has plenty of fight and spirit and are determined to do themselves justice, starting on Friday night. "This is an important time of the season for us, one where we have traditionally done well when the core group and the spirit they have pulls us through. "It won't be any different this season. "There'll be boys coming into the 23 who will see it as a real opportunity to stake a claim for a regular place and we'll be encouraging that attitude as it will help to drive this squad on." Lock Ian Evans (Achilles), prop Dmitri Arhip (Achilles), number eight Dan Baker (shoulder), wing Hanno Dirksen (knee), flanker Tom Smith (knee), scrum-half Rhys Webb (knee) are also Ospreys absentees. Dragon Tovey suffered concussion in the 26-10 defeat to Bath in the Amlin Challenge Cup at the Recreation Ground. Coach Lyn Jones says Tovey will be missed in Swansea, where Kris Burton comes in at pivot. "Jason is a very good rugby player and he brings a lot to the game," said Jones "He has lots of composure and lots of skill and lots of ability. "He is probably very unlucky not to be included in the [Wales] international squad." Only two Dragons players - number eight Toby Faletau and captain and Coombs - were named in Warren Gatland's Wales squad for the Autumn Test series in November. The Ospreys have not won in their last three games and have scored only one try in that time. Two of those defeats have been at the Liberty Stadium, where they have not lost three in a row since 2004. The Ospreys have had the better of their last eight encounters with fellow Welsh regions in the RaboDirect PRO12, whilst the last Welsh region to beat Ospreys at Liberty Stadium was the Dragons themselves in October 2010. The Dragons have not won on the road since a 14-13 victory at Zebre in February. The Men from Gwent have only ever won three away games at fellow Welsh regions in 33 attempts in all competitions. The Dragons have not beaten Ospreys in the PRO12 since 6th January 2012 at Rodney Parade, but did do so in the Anglo Welsh Cup last season. Dragons have won only one of their previous eight visits to Liberty Stadium.

      <description>Wales can do well in Rugby League World Cup says ex-coach</description>

      <body>Clive Griffiths is a name synonymous with Welsh rugby league. The former St Helens player was in charge of Wales for two memorable World Cup campaigns in 1995 and 2000. Wales lost 25-10 to England in that 1995 semi-final and a side captained by Iestyn Harris gave Australia an almighty scare before losing 46-22 at the same stage five years later. Griffiths has also spent a spell as assistant to current head coach Harris, who has been in charge of the national side since 2009. Here, North Wales Crusaders head coach Griffiths looks forward to Wales' fourth World Cup campaign, which begins against Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. "Iestyn's still pretty young as a coach. He's very cool, as he was as a player. I get a bit more animated than Iestyn but we're all different in styles. "He knows the game inside-out and all he needs now is the coaching experience to go with it and the man-management skills which develop as you go along. "Iestyn is learning the hard way. The Crusaders was a tough baptism for him in their final season in Super League. I think he's done the right thing going to assist at Wigan Warriors. He couldn't be at a better rugby league club than Wigan and with time he will be one of the top coaches. "He's got a great chap assisting him in Lee Briers. They're two half-backs who know how the game should be played. "They've been in the fast lane of international rugby and Super League rugby for many a year so there are no better people to put forward that experience and the way of playing the game. "They gave me everything as players and I've got nothing but admiration for them. I've got no doubt these boys will go on to greater things." "There are more Super League players now in the Wales squad than there have been for a long time. It's similar to 1995, when we had players from throughout the game - the Warrington boys, the St Helens connection and the Widnes boys. "Players like Ben Flower and Gil Dudson (both Wigan Warriors) plus Jordan James (Salford Red Devils) are in the fast lane of forward play down the middle. You can see how they've come on as players since they moved up into the higher level. "They've got the foundation; they've got a good forward pack. Our half-backs, number nine and hooker need to guide us around the pitch and make sure everyone's going forward in the right manner. "We've got to keep everyone healthy. People are bound to get injured but we just want to try and get the best team out we possibly can for those games. "I know how fantastic it is to be involved [in the World Cup] and you've got to transfer that to the players. It will be special for them." "Italy will be absolutely buoyed by their 15-14 warm-up match win against England. I couldn't believe the result. "It's the best thing that could have happened to Wales because this could have happened to Wales in our first game. "Everybody now will be totally on their guard and ready for an onslaught from Italy and we'll have a bit more respect for them. "It's going to be a mouth-watering encounter. I still think Wales will win it, but I don't think it's going to be as easy as everyone thought initially. "I don't know how long Italy have been together but they've obviously got some good players in the right positions and they seemed to have gelled pretty quickly. "I think we'll beat the United States and the Cook Islands with something to spare. We played the Cook Islands in 2000 at the Racecourse in Wrexham on a filthy night. It was only 6-6 at half-time but we went away to win by 38-6 in the end and I think it will be a similar tale. "They got absolutely slaughtered by a New Zealand team that were missing five or six of their probable starting line-up. The signs aren't good for the Cook Islands. It will be physical but I think Wales will come through it." "There's no reason why we can't do well. They will get to the quarter-finals, I'm pretty sure of that. "England or Australia in the quarter-final at Wrexham is quite an incentive; the carrot's dangling for the players. You want to play the best as a player, and it's going to be interesting whoever we play in that quarter-final. "With a bit of luck and some good decisions going their way there's no reason why we shouldn't get to the semi-final. As you saw in 2000, anything can happen and it's all on the day. It's cup-tie rugby. We can but dream." Clive Griffiths was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Aled Williams. </body>

      <title>Ten of the best: Welsh music history</title>
      <description>What makes Wales' folk music tradition so different</description>

      <body>This week musicians and music industry leaders from across the globe are in Cardiff as WOMEX, the world's leading World Music Expo arrives in Britain. Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. We asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique. The earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales. "The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch. "Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago." This unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes. Gwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries. Considered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. "The 'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. Singer Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: "The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year." "After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique." Listen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer Siân James has been at the forefront of this movement: "A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute." "It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten." Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists: "This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original 'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the 'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music." During the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose Cân Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the 'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music. "We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log. "By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North and South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties." This medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to / Cymro o Ble / Pedwar Post y Gwely Dafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement. "Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme," he said. Peintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Welsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam (Mother's Love) from that album. Today, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world. WOMEX - The World's Music Comes To Wales is broadcast on BBC Two Wales, Sunday 27 October at 22:00 BST. </body>

      <title>'Bags-for-life' could cost extra 5p</title>
      <description>Extra 5p charge is considered for 'bags-for-life'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24644620</url>

      <body>The 5p charge on single use carrier bags in Wales could be extended to heavy-duty so-called "bags-for-life". Welsh government ministers are considering removing the exemption on the heavier bags. The single-use bag charge was introduced two-years ago, cutting use of the bags in Wales by 90%. Ministers say there is a risk that the heavier bags are now being treated as "throw-away", even though retailers charge between 5p and 10p for them. In their proposals for the environment bill, the government says ministers should have powers to impose a minimum charge on bags-for-life if they believe the sale and disposal of them continues to rise. Recent data has shown the sale of bags-for-life by supermarkets in Wales has more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. In terms of weight, this corresponds to around 30% of the reduction in weight of the thin-gauge single-use bags. In their white paper on the bill, the government says: "An increase in demand for bags-for-life was expected in Wales following the introduction of the charge as consumers got used to reusing their bags and purchased enough bags-for-life for their shopping needs. "However, there is a potential risk that many consumers start treating a low-cost reusable plastic bag as a 'throw-away bag' and discard it prematurely. "This 'substitution effect' is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts if these types of bags are disposed of inappropriately; as such bags are typically made of heavier gauge materials and take longer to degrade." The government has also stated that it will not prevent retailers donating the 5p levy to any good cause, not just the environmental charities that were originally envisaged. It said: "From the information provided by the 246 retailers that have signed up to the code on the Welsh government website and from the retailers' records we have seen, many of the good causes that are currently benefitting from the net proceeds are, for example, cancer charities and children's hospices amongst others. "The Welsh government's stated policy aim in relation to the charge is that it would prefer that environmental good causes benefit from the charge. "However, the Welsh government does not wish to cut across the existing relationships that retailers have with other good causes that contribute to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of Wales." The proposals in the bill come ahead of a review of the current bag charging policy, which will take place next year. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that review will also examine the practices of some retailers. He said: "There is a policy review, which will be undertaken after November of next year, but, certainly, at this moment in time, there are no plans to change the levy. "It depends, of course, on what that review shows and on what we see as the practices of some supermarkets at the moment, which are charging just 1p more for bags for life, thus, avoiding, in some ways, the levy. "We will have to keep a close eye on that, of course." </body>

      <title>Merkel hits out over spying scandal</title>
      <description>Germany's chancellor says it is "really not on" for friends to spy on each other, as an EU summit is overshadowed by a row over US surveillance.</description>

      <body>Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it is "really not on" for friends to spy on each other, referring to alleged US snooping on her phone calls. On arrival at an EU summit in Brussels Mrs Merkel said "we need trust between allies and partners, and such trust needs to be restored". She said she had given that message to US President Barack Obama when they spoke on Wednesday. Other EU leaders also voiced concern about the scale of US surveillance. The spying row threatens to overshadow EU talks on economic growth and migration to the EU. Mrs Merkel has demanded a "complete explanation" of the claims, which came out in the German media. She grew up in former communist East Germany, where secret police surveillance was pervasive. Her delegation in Brussels confirmed she had met briefly to discuss the issue with France's President Francois Hollande, who has expressed alarm at reports that millions of French calls have been monitored by the US. There is concern that the furore could jeopardise EU-US talks on reaching a major free trade deal. The head of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said such a deal was hard to imagine if the US had infringed citizens' privacy. The SPD is in coalition talks with Chancellor Merkel. In a separate development, Italy's weekly L'Espresso reported that the US and UK had been spying on Italian internet and phone traffic. The revelations were sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden. It is alleged that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK spy centre GCHQ eavesdropped on three undersea cables with terminals in Italy. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta described the allegations as "inconceivable and unacceptable" and said he wanted to get to the truth of them. Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again Edward Snowden was the source of the report. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the alleged spying on Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls was "serious" and added: "I will support her (Merkel) completely in her complaint and say that this is not acceptable - I think we need all the facts on the table first." Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen echoed him, saying: "We have to get clarification of what has happened and we also need a guarantee that this will never happen again, if it has happened." Germany summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the alleged spying. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said about his meeting with US envoy John Emerson that he had demanded straight answers from Washington, warning that their friendship is at stake. Mrs Merkel discussed the issue with President Obama on Wednesday. He told her the US was not monitoring her calls and would not in future, the White House said. However, it left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright said the spying allegations were "not a surprise to people - countries spy on each other", and added that France had spied on her when she was in government. The formal agenda for the summit focuses on efforts to consolidate Europe's fragile economic recovery and to create a single market in digital services. British Prime Minister David Cameron will also call on the EU to reduce regulations for business. But France's President Hollande pressed for the spying issue to be put on the agenda. The veteran French EU Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC that "enough is enough", and confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The digital economy is on the official summit agenda for Thursday evening. One of the key initiatives of the European Commission is its Digital Agenda for Europe, which it says "aims to reboot Europe's economy and help Europe's citizens and businesses to get the most out of digital technologies". Council officials say investment in the digital economy is vital to boost growth, which is creeping back to the European economy. They want to address market fragmentation and a perceived shortage of IT skills. Mr Cameron is likely to use the economic discussion to raise what Britain sees as a proliferation of red tape. He said last week: "All too often EU rules are a handicap for firms," and that small business owners "are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless, burdensome and costly regulations". The European Commission - which makes the rules - has recognised that it may have gone too far in some places. President Jose Manuel Barroso says he wants the EU to be "big on big things and smaller on smaller things". He says the Commission has cut more than 5,000 legal acts in the past five years and wants to do more. On Friday the leaders will discuss relations with central European countries, ahead of a November summit in Lithuania where new agreements will be signed. Migration will also be discussed, following the loss of hundreds of lives among migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. </body>

      <title>Portuguese police reopen McCann case</title>
      <description>Portuguese police reopen their inquiry into the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, saying there are "new lines of inquiry".</description>

      <body>Portuguese police have reopened their inquiry into the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, the public prosecutor's office has said. Madeleine, from Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared from Praia da Luz in the Algarve in May 2007. Portugal's attorney general said "new elements of evidence" justified the "continuation of the investigation", which was shelved by police in 2008. Madeleine's parents said they hoped for "the answers we so desperately need". Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 - codenamed Operation Grange - and opened a formal investigation in July this year. Portuguese police said a review team had been working since March 2011 to look back through information from the original investigation - and this process had uncovered potential new lines of inquiry. The decision comes after Scotland Yard said at a briefing earlier this year that the Portuguese inquiry would not be re-opened until judges there were convinced there were solid grounds to do so. It would appear that this decision is highly significant, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood met senior Portuguese police in Lisbon last Thursday for a briefing on the new lines of enquiry, which are "separate" to those being followed by the Met. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were also briefed on the case during the meeting. They said they were "very pleased" the Portuguese inquiry, which will run alongside the Met operation, was being reopened. "We hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime," they said. "We once again urge any member of the public who may have information relating to Madeleine's abduction to contact the police in Portugal or the UK." Mr Rowley, assistant commissioner for specialist crime and operations, said the meeting was "very positive" and both forces had a "shared determination" to solve the case. "I believe that we have the best opportunity yet to finally understand what happened to Madeleine," he said. UK Home Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: "I hope what we are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie's parents and family." Clickable map and timeline Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment on 3 May 2007, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar. The three-year-old and her brother and sister were left in the apartment at 20:30, with their father checking on them at 21:05. Mrs McCann raised the alarm at 22:00 when she realised Madeleine was gone. Since then there has been much speculation about what happened to the youngster. In July, the Met said new evidence had come to light, and last week an appeal launched on BBC Crimewatch prompted 2,400 responses. Met detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. The Met are offering a £20,000 reward for information. They say their inquiries have led to the "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. On Wednesday, Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe defended the way Portuguese police had handled the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. "I'm sure for them that must have been a challenge. Anybody can go back after two, three, five, six years and say 'why didn't you do that'? That's easy in hindsight," he said. </body>

      <title>Light shed on how genes shape face</title>
      <description>Scientists identify thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop.</description>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <description>Political leaders express optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accept a survival plan.</description>

      <body>Political leaders have expressed optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accepted a survival plan put forward by management. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael spoke to plant owners Ineos on Thursday afternoon. Unite had earlier agreed to "embrace" the firm's proposals "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs on Wednesday. Workers had previously rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Meanwhile, Ineos said the number of contractors who have been laid off at the Grangemouth complex, since the dispute started last week, had reached 2,000. Workers from Doosan Babcock leaving the plant said that more than 100 of them had just been told that there was no more work. Other companies are understood to have given a similar message to staff in the past 24 hours. Several of those affected blamed Ineos staff for holding out against changes to pay and pensions. Earlier, UK and Scottish governments representatives had expressed optimism over the future of the petrochemical and refinery at Grangemouth. After meeting with Ineos, Mr Carmichael said: "We are in a much better place today in relation to the future of the plant than we were yesterday. "There remains, of course, a great deal to be done." Finance Secretary John Swinney commented: "Behind us is a plant of over 1,000 high quality jobs in refining and petrochemicals, these are very skilled high quality jobs and the Scottish economy and UK economy requires that economic impact. "This plant has got a great future, everybody accepts that Grangemouth has got a great future. "What we need to do is resolve these outstanding issues, get the investment plan implemented and take forward and improve the prospects for the people that work in this plant." Ineos has said it plans to make an official statement on the Grangemouth issue on Friday. The BBC understands that some kind of agreement is being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. Local MP Michael Connarty said he believed the union would be making no challenges to the survival plan and would be accepting it in full. He added: "As far as I understand the company are away to draft it into a legal document which the convenor will sign on behalf of the shop stewards committee, and that will then be binding on the workforce in the plant." Unite earlier said it had made a number of recommendations to Ineos at its meeting on Thursday morning. General secretary Len McCluskey said: "This plant is on cold shut down and each day that goes by makes it harder to start back up again, which is why the stewards made the offer to the company - so that we can get people back to work." He said the union would not let the plant close, adding Unite had been "encouraged" by similar comments from First Minister Alex Salmond. Mr McCluskey has told Ineos he wants to meet Mr Ratcliffe for face-to-face discussions, arguing it would be an opportunity for him to "clarify" Unite's position and for Mr Ratcliffe to raise the assurances he was seeking. Mr McCluskey added: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during a visit to Yorkshire, said he remained hopeful a resolution to the dispute could be reached. He added: "This is an important business for Scotland, it's a very important industry for the whole of the United Kingdom. "We want to see those jobs saved, we want to see this business thrive, and I'm hopeful that agreements will be reached." Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had discussed the crisis with Unite and believed the union "fully understands the gravity of the situation". "They want to represent their members, and rightly so, and they're concerned about their members' jobs and livelihoods," he added. Before the talks with Unite, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that £300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" David Watt, from the Institute of Directors, said it was "quite sad" that the dispute at Grangemouth had reached this point. He commented: "It's rather gloomy in the way this has developed. I would have hoped both parties could have negotiated over a longer period. "I think there are opportunities but it's quite sad that we've got to this point. "There are probably faults by both sides." And he said he was surprised that the union thought the closure announcement was a shock. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro dies</title>
      <description>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro, widely regarded as one of the greatest of his generation, dies at the age of 89.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24654484</url>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died of a heart attack at the age of 89, his family has confirmed. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years". Among his many prizes was 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture for his piece Promenade. Awarded by the Royal Academy of Arts, the £10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. He told The Independent: "It's what I like doing. Old age is a shock, but I still enjoy making the works." "I look forward to going into the studio. I would be bored if I didn't do that." Sir Anthony played a pivotal role in the development of 20th Century sculpture, after first coming to public attention with a show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963. There, he exhibited large abstract sculptures, such as Early One Morning (1962), which were brightly painted and stood directly on the ground to engage the spectator on a one-to-one basis. It was a radical departure from the way sculpture had been seen in the past and paved the way for future developments in three-dimensional art. "I did break something open at the beginning," Sir Anthony said in June. "A tremendous lot of possibilities opened up to me when that happened, and I've been exploring these different areas for the rest of my life." The artist added: "Sculpture did have some assumptions and some, well, rules almost and I broke those rules." He was born in Surrey in 1924 and studied engineering at Christ's College Cambridge, before going on to specialise in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London until 1952. Sir Anthony then went on to influence others as a teacher at St Martin's School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981. There he inspired a younger generation of British sculptors including Phillip King, Tony Cragg, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. In the early 1950s he had started his own sculpting career by making rugged bronze animal and human figures, which were said to be concerned with "what it is like to be inside the body". His more famous later work, which questioned assumptions about form, material and subject matter in sculpture, can currently be seen in a major exhibition at The Museo Correr in Venice until 27 October. In a statement following his death, Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of 90, was still evident in the most recent work". Sir Anthony was also awarded the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997. He was knighted in 1987 and received the Order of Merit in May 2000, which recognises great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science, and he was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain in 2005. With Norman Foster and Tony Fitzpatrick he co-designed London's landmark Millennium Bridge, but the £18.2m project had to be closed down three days after it was opened in June 2000, as it swayed "alarmingly". Engineers blamed the "synchronised footfall" effect of hundreds of people stepping in unison and it was reopened nearly two years in February 2002, after £5m of modifications. Sir Anthony was married to painter Sheila Girling, with whom he had two sons and three grandchildren. He had a close relationship with the Royal Academy of Arts throughout his career and chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith has paid tribute to the late Royal Academician. "Sir Anthony Caro OM CBE RA was one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century," said Saumarez Smith. "He was elected as a Senior Member of the Royal Academy on 9 March 2004 and will be much missed by the RA as well as his friends and admirers internationally." </body>

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, said publishing the data was an "important step" towards improving transparency across the NHS, informing and empowering patients and identifying under-performing hospitals. But he added: "Hospitals are large, complex organisations so we need to avoid oversimplifying or reducing vast amounts of data to a simple band or rating." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned £3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Sadly, under the last government, a lack of transparency about poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long, some times with tragic consequences for patients. "This government is being honest with the public about the quality of care at their local hospitals, and taking tough action where standards aren't up to scratch. Patients and staff deserve nothing less." </body>

      <title>Maria 'parents' give DNA to police</title>
      <description>A Bulgarian couple suspected of being the biological parents of Maria, the blonde girl found in a Greek Roma community, have given their DNA to police.</description>

      <body>A Bulgarian couple suspected of being the biological parents of Maria, the young girl found in a Roma community in Greece, have been questioned by police. Officials said they had taken DNA samples and were investigating whether the woman had sold the child, a crime that could result in a jail sentence. The couple have been named by Bulgarian media as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev, from the central town of Nikolaevo. A woman believed to be Ms Ruseva has admitted giving up a baby in Greece. But she denied to Bulgarian TV reports that she had received payment for the girl four years ago. She could not say for definite that Maria was hers, but said she burst into tears when she saw the girl on news reports. Maria bears a striking resemblance to some of her other children. Maria came to the Greek police's attention after they raided the Roma camp near Farsala in central Greece last week. They were initially searching for drugs and weapons, but noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents. They found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been 8,000 inquiries following an appeal to identify her, and the international police body Interpol has been involved in the search for her biological family. The couple believed to be Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev, and their eight children, were filmed by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek town of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back anytime you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she left her child with. Prosecutors announced they had pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". "A DNA test has been taken from Ruseva, and information has been collected about her trips to Greece in the last years,'' said a statement from the prosecutor's office. Greek news site zougla.gr earlier published what it said was the identity card of Ms Ruseva and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <title>'Cameras on cops' plan for patrols</title>
      <description>Police in England and Wales are to hold large-scale trials of body-worn video – standard issue cameras to be worn by all officers on patrol.</description>

      <body>Police in England and Wales are to hold large-scale trials of body-worn video cameras for all officers on patrol. The move by the College of Policing follows concern that the "plebgate" scandal has dented public confidence. Cameras are already used by some forces. Hampshire have issued the jacket-mounted kit to 450 officers. They are now standard issue for uniformed police on the Isle of Wight. The college has been studying the results from an American pilot study. Police officers in Rialto, California, were issued with video cameras. Last month they reported an 88% reduction in complaints filed against officers and a 60% fall in incidents where officers used force. "As a consequence of these studies the College of Policing is looking at piloting the use of body-worn video," said Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the college. "We see these trials as being beneficial in reducing police use of force and public complaints against police." Body-worn video was first used in Britain by Devon and Cornwall police in 2006. Strathclyde and Grampian police have also piloted the equipment in Scotland, and an evaluation in 2011 concluded its use may have reduced crime and assaults on officers as well as reassured the public. Earlier this year, Hampshire police made video cameras part of standard-issue for all 173 uniformed officers on the Isle of Wight and response teams on the mainland. "Body-worn video is our independent witness," said Inspector Steve Goodier who leads the Isle of Wight team. "The recording means it is undeniable what went on, so we can actually answer the question that needs to be answered if someone disputes a conversation or an officer's use of force." Officers wearing the cameras are subject to strict controls on its use and subsequent storage. Pictures are deleted after 30 days unless they are required for evidential reasons. Nevertheless, the equipment is likely to raise privacy concerns. In the United States, the use of cameras by customs and border protection officers is subject to a comprehensive policy framework that balances "effective oversight and protecting civil liberties". Recently, a district judge in New York ordered the use of body-worn cameras by police officers to "encourage lawful and respectful interactions between police and suspects". </body>

      <title>Press seeks Leveson legal challenge</title>
      <description>A newspaper industry group is to seek a judicial review after its plans for press regulation were rejected earlier this month, the BBC learns.</description>

      <body>A newspaper industry group is to seek a judicial review after its regulation plans were rejected earlier this month. The Privy Council, which rejected the industry plans, had been expected to rubber stamp a plan agreed by the main Westminster parties in the next week. Opponents say this plan could result in the end of the free press and hope the legal move will delay its approval but the government says it will push ahead. The row follows the phone-hacking scandal and subsequent Leveson inquiry. One senior industry source said they hoped bid for a judicial review would put a "spoke in the wheels" of the Westminster plan. "It's very hard to imagine them proceeding next week to file their Royal Charter when the previous decision is subject to judicial review," he said. Some in the industry have warned that a system decided by politicians risks bringing an end to press freedom. The Newspaper Society said the press's preferred charter was not handled fairly as the Privy Council committee - which is set to agree the final proposals on 30 October - failed to consult the press. The judicial review application will be made by Pressbof (Press Standards Board of Finance), the industry body that funds the current Press Complaints Commission. Pressbof's chairman Lord Black of Brentwood said: "The government and the Privy Council should have applied the most rigorous standards of consultation and examination of the Royal Charter proposed by the industry, which would have enshrined tough regulatory standards at the same time as protecting press freedom. "They singularly failed to do so, and that is why - as the issues at stake are so extraordinarily high - we are having to take this course of action." The campaign group which represents some victims of press intrusion, Hacked Off, accused the press of being predictable and self serving. The group's director Brian Cathcart said: "The people leading this part of the newspaper industry are exposing themselves as desperate and deaf. "Desperate, because they are now resorting to a legal challenge to something based on the findings of a public inquiry, and backed by the victims of press abuse, all parties in Parliament and the overwhelming majority of the public. "Deaf, because they refuse to listen to the evidence that there is no threat to the free press and that this deal actually benefits the press, both financially and in terms of freedom of expression." Meanwhile, the press is highlighting plans to set up its own regulator under its own rules. Documents including a contract to bind publishers and the regulations under which a new regulator would work were due to be published online at 19:00 BST. They expect the new regulator to be operating by next year. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport commented: "The government is working to bring in a system of independent press self-regulation that will protect press freedom while offering real redress when mistakes are made. "The culture secretary pushed hard for recent changes on arbitration and the standards code to be made, which will ensure the system is workable and the decision to go to court is particularly disappointing in light of these changes." </body>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>Strong winds and heavy rain predicted for Monday could cause disruption across Wales and southern England, according to forecasters. The Met Office issued an amber alert for wind and there is also concern that heavy rain could cause flooding. It warned people to "be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures" caused by strong winds. There is uncertainty about the timing of the storm at this stage. But Nick Miller from the BBC Weather Centre said it "could be a particularly nasty weather system", adding its "most likely track" was through the middle of England of Wales. Forecasters say there is potential for gusts of wind over 80mph, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. Northern England, the Midlands, southern England and Wales have also been issued with a yellow warning for rain on Monday. Yellow alerts are the lowest level of the three warnings. The Met Office said people in those areas should "be aware of the potential for surface water flooding" because of the rain. The Met Office's chief forecaster said: "A strong, high-level jet is expected to engage warm low level air to give rise to a rapidly moving low pressure system later on Sunday. "This is expected to run north-eastwards, probably across England and Wales, with very strong winds on its southern and western flanks. "There is the potential for gusts of over 80 mph, especially on exposed coasts, both in south-westerly winds ahead of the low and west to north-westerly winds behind it." </body>

      <description>The Ukrainian WBC heavyweight boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, confirms he will run in the country's 2015 presidential election.</description>

      <body>The Ukrainian WBC heavyweight boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, has confirmed he will run in the country's 2015 presidential election. He made his announcement in response to a bill passed in parliament that bars candidates who have lived outside Ukraine during the past 10 years. The pro-Western Udar party MP has permanent resident status in Germany. "Everything that has taken place in parliament today... does not intimidate me and will not stop me," he said. "To head off these various schemes and attempts at getting even with me as a possible candidate, I want to declare this: I will run for president." Mr Klitschko is the first declared contender against the incumbent, Viktor Yanukovych. He has actively campaigned against what he calls the president's "authoritarian policies". The bill adopted on Wednesday amended Ukraine's current tax code. It now states that if a Ukrainian national holds permanent resident status in another country they cannot be considered a resident of Ukraine. Previously, they only had to live in Ukraine for at least 180 days a year. According to the constitution, a presidential candidate must have been resident in Ukraine for 10 years prior to polling day. Mr Klitschko said the amendment clearly had a "political context", something denied by a member of Mr Yanukovych's Party of Regions. The 42-year-old boxer heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms (Udar), whose acronym means "Punch". It came third in last year's parliamentary elections. "My main goal is for Ukraine to be a European, modern country with European standards of life," Mr Klitschko told the BBC in August. "I will decide with people who have the same vision, the same dream, to go into politics and from the inside to change the situation." He has spoken out against corruption in the country and the jailing of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko for abuse of office - a charge that her supporters claim was politically motivated. "We can't be a democratic country with political prisoners," he said. Mr Klitschko is also pushing to strengthen Ukraine's links with the EU. "We see our future in the European family. We are European with our mentality, with our history," he said. </body>

      <title>Women 'better multitaskers' than men</title>
      <description>It's not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, and employers should bear this in mind, say the authors of a new study.</description>

      <body>It's not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking, or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric circles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>David Cameron announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But the Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. He insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. But Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the government of coming up with a "panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers". During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron would "stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In a speech, Mr Miliband argued the prime minister had "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. He accused Mr Cameron of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, adding: "Governments have always looked at this balance but this government wants you to pick up the tab for its failure to stand up to the energy companies. That won't offer the real help that business and families need. "They propose a panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers. We offer a real freeze paid for by the big energy companies." </body>

      <body>The mocked "obesity excuse" of being born with a slow metabolism is actually true for some people, say researchers. A team at the University of Cambridge has found the first proof that mutated DNA does indeed slow metabolism. The researchers say fewer than one in 100 people are affected and are often severely obese by early childhood. The findings, published in the journal Cell, may lead to new obesity treatments even for people without the mutation. Scientists at the Institute of Metabolic Science, in Cambridge, knew that mice born without a section of DNA, a gene called KSR2, gained weight more easily. But they did not know what affect it may be having in people, so they analysed the DNA of 2,101 severely obese patients. Some had mutated versions of KSR2. It had a twin effect of increasing their appetite while their slowing metabolism. "You would be hungry and wanting to eat a lot, you would not want to move because of a slower metabolism and would probably also develop type 2 diabetes at a young age," lead researcher Prof Sadaf Farooqi told the BBC. She added: "It slows the ability to burn calories and that's important as it's a new explanation for obesity." KSR2 is mostly active in the brain and it affects the way individual cells interpret signals, such as the hormone insulin, from the blood. This in turn affects the body's ability to burn calories. Prof Farooqi said the metabolism argument had been derided by doctors, as well as wider society, due to a lack of evidence that metabolism was slowed in obese patients. In many cases obese patients have an elevated metabolism to cope with fuelling a much larger body. She said less than 1% of people had mutated versions of the gene and some would be a normal weight, but about 2% of children who were obese by the age of five would have the mutated gene. However, if drugs could be developed to target problems with KSR2, then it might be beneficial to anyone who is too fat. "Other genetic disorders, such as in blood pressure, have shown that even where there's a normal gene, targeting the pathway can still help," Prof Farooqi said. The amount and types of food eaten, as well as levels of exercise, directly affect weight, but some people at more risk of becoming obese that others. Obesity can run in families. The other obesity genes that have been discovered tend to affect appetite. People have two copies of the FTO gene - one from each parent - and each copy comes in a high- and a low-risk form. Those with two-high risk copies of the FTO gene are thought to be 70% more likely to become obese than those with low-risk genes. It makes fatty foods more tempting and alters levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin. Dr Katarina Kos, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: "It is an exciting and interesting breakthrough, this is a new pathway predisposing people to obesity. "But it does exist in obese and lean people so you still need the obesogenic environment." </body>

      <title>Free school head checks scaled back</title>
      <description>Documents leaked to the BBC show ministers agreed to scrap pre-appointment checks on inexperienced free school heads despite warnings from civil servants.</description>

      <body>Checks on inexperienced staff who want to be head teachers at free schools have been scrapped, despite warnings from civil servants. Candidates without headship experience had been required to attend assessment centres to ensure they were "capable" of "setting up and running" a school. It comes as Nick Clegg says all schools should employ qualified teachers - free schools can employ unqualified staff. The government insists it closely monitors all head teacher appointments. But a leaked Department for Education document, seen by the BBC and the Guardian, reveals that civil servants were concerned that a lack of checks may lead to unsuitable candidates, referred to as principal designates, being appointed to run schools. It says: "Without the Principal Designate Assessment Centres some free school projects may appoint inexperienced principal designates who are not suitable which would significantly undermine the success of the school." Free schools, like academies, are different from regular state schools because they are allowed to hire unqualified teachers. (Independent schools can do this too.) Nonetheless the paper shows that ministers, including Secretary of State Michael Gove and David Laws, approved the scrapping of the requirement to attend assessment centres in February this year. They also approved a move to allow free school trusts to arrange their own pre-registration checks with Ofsted. These checks focus mainly on the safety of the building in which the school is to be run, and verify that child protection protocols, for example, have been met. It is the only check that the education inspectorate makes on free schools before they open and is particularly important as free schools are not monitored by local authorities, but are funded with taxpayers' money. After that initial check, Ofsted visit free schools within two years of them opening, as with all new schools. Civil servants writing the document, warn that groups may not arrange a "timely inspection when left to their own devices" and issues may be identified "that can't be resolved ahead of opening". This could lead to the schools not being legally ready to open as scheduled, the paper says. With free schools increasingly appearing on local authority school application forms, it could mean some parents who have picked the school for their child end up severely inconvenienced. Ofsted chief inspector Michael Wilshaw has stressed the need for good school leadership and for teachers who are up to the job. And Mr Gove has reduced the time it takes for school management to sack teachers who are not performing well enough. The scaling back of checks is part of departmental plans to save almost a third of its budget for free schools. However, the document also reveals that at the same time the DfE is planning to save 15% from its young people's and maintained schools groups budget "so that its increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time it is reducing the "financial analysis in support of the free school programme", the document shows. The paper warns: "The risk is that free school proposals will not be subject to financial scrutiny." As part of this the funding, allocation and payment systems are being switched from a face-to-face contact to a more web-based "self-service" system. The revelations come as a number of problems have been emerging at some free schools in recent weeks and months. Two schools, including the Al-Madinah faith school in Derby, were put into special measures to bring them up to scratch. And an unqualified head teacher stepped down from a free school in central London amid claims the governors may have regretted appointing an unqualified candidate. The Department for Education insists free schools are raising standards and said: "Assessment centres did not add value to the process. We undertake due diligence checks and closely monitor all proposed head teacher appointments - including having a representative on the recruitment panel in many cases." A spokesman said: "We have achieved this while maintaining proper scrutiny of free school applications and any suggestion that the process has been weakened is false. "Financial scrutiny of free school applications continues to be carried out by trained DfE staff with advice from financial experts. This allows a better overview of the whole application and approval process." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan has now written to Mr Gove calling for him to publish the proposals for savings on free schools in full. He said: "Labour has long warned of the dangers of the free schools programme such as the lack of adequate oversight; the use of unqualified teachers; and their prioritisation ahead of addressing areas that desperately need new school places." Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "We are clear that head teachers need to have qualified teacher status no matter what the structure of the school. Teaching is a profession with an academic and theoretical foundation as well as the skills and craft gained through experience. "Parents are right to expect their child's teachers will be qualified as an assurance of their ability. Heads also value qualifications when recruiting. This is why we have welcomed Nick Clegg's acknowledgement today that teaching is a skilled profession." </body>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>Seven-planet solar system found</title>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered the seventh planet orbiting a distant star.</description>

      <body>Astronomers may have identified one of the richest planetary systems yet. The discovery of a seventh planet around the dwarf star KIC 11442793 could be a record, according to two separate teams of researchers. The system bears some similarities to our own, but all seven planets orbit much closer to their host star, which lies some 2,500 light-years from Earth. The crowded solar system is described in two papers published on the pre-print server Arxiv.org. One of the identifications was made by volunteers using the Planet Hunters website. The site was set up to allow volunteers to sift through the public data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which was launched to search for so-called exoplanets - worlds orbiting distant stars. Kepler uses the transit method to discover new planets, which entails looking for the dip in light as an alien world passes in front of its host star. But there is simply too much data for mission scientists to examine every light curve, so they developed computer programmes to search for the signature of a planetary transit. "This is the first seven-planet system from Kepler, using a transiting search. We think [the identification] is very secure," said Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, co-author on the Planet Hunters paper. "With a transiting system, once you get multiple planets, the odds of them being false positives are very small." Dr Lintott's team has submitted their research to the Astronomical Journal for peer review. Another team of astronomers from several European countries has submitted a separate paper outlining their independent discovery of the seventh planet to the Astrophysical Journal. The new planet is the fifth furthest from its parent star, orbiting with a period of nearly 125 days. With a radius of 2.8 times that of the Earth, it fits into a family that now includes two roughly Earth sized worlds, three "super-Earths" and two larger bodies. "It actually looks like our Solar System in one sense, with all the small planets on the inside and the big planets on the outside. And that's not necessarily what we always see," said co-author Robert Simpson, also from Oxford University. While there might be resemblances to our Solar System, all seven planets are closer to their host star. In fact they would all fit within the Earth's distance from the Sun, making this a very crowded neighbourhood. "This is one of the reasons they are easy to see, because the closer they are to their sun, the more frequently they go around it," said Dr Simpson. However, the Planet Hunters team carried out simulations showing that the planetary system should be a stable one. Dr Lintott, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme and helped found Planet Hunters, added: "Everything we know about this system tells us [the seventh planet] should have been found using the automatic detection routines. But it wasn't." "A seven-planet system is very complicated so you get a sense of why the automatic routine might have missed out - it gets confused by the presence of the other transits. "Looking for these transits seems like a task that's perfectly designed for computers. But we keep finding, in these niche cases, in these odd cases, in these complicated cases that humans can beat the computers." Another star, HD 10180, has been claimed to have either seven, or nine planetary signals. A distant sun called GJ 887C may also have a family of seven planets. Commenting on the paper by the Planet Hunters team, Andrew Collier Cameron, professor of astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: "It's intriguing that a system as well-studied as KOI-351 can still harbour hidden surprises that can only be winkled out by human eyes." He added: "This is a perennial problem in transit hunting, of which we are only too acutely aware in our own ground-based searches. "The best transit signal-detection algorithms developed to date still come a very poor second to the human visual system when it comes to pattern recognition. Still, we have to rely on machines, because of the sheer volume of data produced by enterprises like transit searches." Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <body>A prominent Australian artist who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs has won a major national art prize. Nigel Milsom was awarded the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, winning $150,000, for his portrait Uncle Paddy. He pleaded guilty to robbing a 7-11 store in Sydney in April 2012. He later apologised to police, saying he thought he was "buying doughnuts". Milsom, a former security guard, is serving six years for armed robbery. The artist, who suffers from depression, completed the painting earlier this year while on bail awaiting sentencing for the crime. The winning portrait was picked by 2009 Moran Prize winner Ben Quilty and ex-Art Gallery of South Australia director Daniel Thomas, who were not told the names of the artists. "The fact is it was the best painting," Quilty told the Australian newspaper. "I judged the painting, not him." "Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good," said judge Daniel Thomas . "So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money." He praised Milsom's "extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate". Uncle Paddy depicts one of Milsom's grandfather's oldest friends; Thomas called it "a very old-fashioned Australian face". "There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too," said Milsom. "When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom." The Moran Prize, which annually awards contemporary Australian portraiture, is now in its 25th year. All the winning pictures become part of the Moran Arts Foundation Collection. Last year Milsom won the $30,000 art prize for the 2012 Sulman Prize. Weeks later, armed with a knife, axe and a fake gun, he and another man threatened to kill a shopkeeper while holding him hostage in the store room of a 7-11 store, reported the Telegraph. "My state of mind is hard to describe ... I thought I was buying doughnuts,'" he told the court earlier this year. "It felt like I was watching something as a movie that wasn't really happening." At the time of the crime, the court heard the artist had recently lost his mentor, art curator Nick Waterlow, and his sister, and was high on a combination of heroin, crystal meth, prescription drugs and alcohol. </body>

      <title>How do people avoid picking a terrible housemate?</title>

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <title>10 ways christening has changed</title>

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <body>Tottenham Hotspur moved a step closer to the Europa League knockout stages with a hard-earned victory away to Sheriff Tiraspol in Moldova. Jan Vertonghen's header from Christian Eriksen's cross set Spurs on their way. Vlad Chiriches produced a superb clearance to deny Henrique Luvannor an equaliser before Aaron Lennon hit a post on his first start for two months. Jermain Defoe's deflected shot doubled the lead as Spurs made it three wins in three games in Group K. The England international's 75th-minute strike moved him level with Martin Chivers's club record of 22 European goals. Having disposed of Norway's Tromso and Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala without conceding a goal, Spurs knew a third group victory would confirm their place in the last 32 - if Anzhi's home clash with Tromso ended level. It did not, but Anzhi's 1-0 win means Tottenham will reach the knockout stages if they defeat Sheriff at White Hart Lane on 7 November. Villas-Boas will hope it is a more comfortable experience than the one he endured at the Sheriff Stadium. The champions of Moldova have not won a group game in Europe for three years and must have feared the worst when Vertonghen beat captain Miral Samardzic in the air to power Eriksen's 12th-minute cross home, the Belgian's first goal since March. Yet Vertonghen spent the rest of the half at the other end of the pitch as Sheriff put the Spurs defence under intense pressure. The hosts would have been level in the 15th minute but for a superb piece of defending by Chiriches, the Romania international denying Luvannor an equaliser after the Brazilian rounded Hugo Lloris and rolled the ball towards an empty net. Cadu, another Brazilian, had a goal ruled out for offside, Ismail Isa flashed the ball across the face of goal and Luvannor fired over the bar as the home side continued to press. And there were anxious faces on the Spurs bench when Isa went down in the penalty area under a challenge from Sandro. But Tottenham survived on a night when the result outweighed the performance - and it might have been more comfortable for Villas-Boas had Lennon marked his first start since the opening weekend of the season with a goal, twice going close to doubling Spurs' lead. Defoe's goal confirmed the victory, though, and the Londoners reach the midway point of the group stage with a 100% record and yet to concede a goal. </body>

      <title>Court hears bid to cancel Indian GP</title>
      <description>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix.</description>

      <body>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday which is seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. The petition was filed on the grounds that the organisers have allegedly not paid taxes for a previous event. However, race organisers say the race will still go ahead. Indian motorsports chief Vicky Chandhok said: "The race will go on. There's absolutely no doubt about that. This has happened many times before." Chandhok, who heads the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, added: "You've had people trying to stop cricket matches - our justice system is pretty strong that no sporting event should be stopped. "It's a civil matter. Let it be heard in court as long as it takes and that's it. No worries." A spokesman for the circuit's owner, Jaypee Sports International Limited, said: "Whatever the court says, we are ready to follow." Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 90 points with 100 still available, could clinch his fourth title in India this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will triumph if he finishes fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The Supreme Court in India has executive powers and ordered circuit bosses two years ago to freeze 25% of ticket revenues until they had settled an outstanding tax dispute. That ruling followed Public Interest Litigation filed by campaigner Amit Kumar, the same man who is behind Thursday's petition. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is already uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <description>Uefa opens a disciplinary case against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans" against Manchester City.</description>

      <body>Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans" during their home Champions League match against Manchester City. City midfielder Yaya Toure said he was subjected to racist chanting during his team's 2-1 win in Moscow on Wednesday. The European governing body says the case will be dealt with by its disciplinary board on 30 October. CSKA Moscow consider the racism allegations to be "unfounded". Manchester City said on Thursday that they had submitted a formal written complaint to Uefa, which is also looking into the setting off of fireworks by home supporters during the match in the Russian capital. In May, Uefa announced that in the case of racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure would be applied for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (£42,800). CSKA's next home game in the Champions League is against Bayern Munich on 27 November, before which they visit Manchester City on 5 November. Ivory Coast international Toure said he was "furious" and reported the chants to the referee during the game and afterwards. But CSKA are "surprised and disappointed" by Toure's claims. A club statement read: "Having carefully studied the video of the game, we found no racist insults from fans of CSKA." CSKA spokesman Michael Sanadnze told BBC Radio 5 live: "We have nothing to hide, of course, and we have confirmation from the match delegate and the venue director that they themselves didn't hear anything special." Lord Ouseley, chairman of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, said the latest incident would "test" Uefa's new sanctions. He added referee Ovidiu Hategan should not officiate again after failing to follow protocol when Toure reported the incidents to him. Under guidelines issued by Uefa in 2009, referees have the power to tackle racist chanting from supporters in a number of ways. As a first step, they can stop a match and ask for warnings to be made over the public address system. The second step is to suspend a match for a short time. If the abuse continues, a match can be abandoned. Romanian official Hategan, a Fifa referee since 2008, was also in charge when Lazio fans were found guilty of racist behaviour towards Tottenham players in the Europa League last season. FIFPro, the global union for professional footballers, is "disappointed" match officials failed to act. And Ouseley said if players are not adequately protected, more could walk off the pitch during a game, as former AC Milan player Kevin Prince-Boateng did during a friendly last season. Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Maria Miller told BBC Sport she was concerned by the incident given Russia is due to host the World Cup in 2018. She said: "When countries like Russia are going to be very shortly hosting the World Cup, it's important we know a tough line is going to be taken." Norwich manager Chris Hughton was allegedly subjected to racist abuse on Twitter recently. When asked whether he believed Uefa were doing enough to stop the problem of racism, he said: "Well I don't think so, because it is still happening. "They need to put themselves in the position of those that are being targeted. "Penalties these days seem to be fines, fines are very easily paid, particularly by the bigger clubs. "Do we need harsher penalties? Absolutely we do… but Uefa have a real good opportunity to act."

      <title>Changes agreed to European club rugby</title>
      <description>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian unions agree to change the structure of European club rugby.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24660351</url>

      <body>The English, French, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and Italian governing bodies have agreed to change the structure of European club rugby. After meetings in Dublin, they agreed on the formation of two tweaked competitions of 20 teams each as well as a change in revenue distribution. But top English and French clubs, who have proposed a breakaway competition from next season, were not present. The Anglo-French plan has been backed by the four Welsh regions. Premiership Rugby (PRL) in England and Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR) in France say they will have no involvement in the Heineken Cup or Amlin Challenge Cup from next season. Instead of competing in European Rugby Cup (ERC) competitions, the PRL and LNR plan to form an alternative Rugby Champions Cup. Details of this competition could be rolled out next month. PRL and LNR are unhappy at how teams qualify for the Heineken Cup, especially from the RaboDirect Pro12 league, and how proceeds are shared. Currently, only the top six clubs in England and France are guaranteed a place in the Heineken Cup, whereas at least 10 Pro12 outfits - including both Scottish teams (Edinburgh and Glasgow), both Italian teams (Treviso and Zebre) and a minimum of three sides each from Wales and Ireland - have automatic entry into the competition. As part of the new proposals, only seven clubs from the Pro12 would qualify for the primary tournament. In addition, the revenue would be split evenly between the three leagues - the English Premiership, France's Top 14 and the Pro12 - as proposed by English and French clubs in June of last year. But PRL said Thursday's developments offer "no more than half a solution" to the crisis. "It seems that the proposals we have made on competition formats and on financial distribution have been accepted," said its chief executive Mark McCafferty. "Hopefully, it is a sign that in due course the whole approach we've been proposing is bought into. I guess time will tell. "It is far from complete, but the pieces they have commented on are in line with what we've proposed. "We have always said that there is no way we are going into any competitions that are run by ERC after the end of this season. That hasn't changed. "We feel a fresh start has got to be made." Remaining stumbling blocks are the rival television broadcasting deals between Sky and BT and the insistence of English and French outfits that clubs should run European competitions, rather than the unions. Representatives from the Rugby Football Union, French Rugby Federation, Scottish Rugby Union, Welsh Rugby Union, Irish Rugby Union and Italian Rugby Federation were all present in Dublin. They issued a statement which read: "Progress has been made on a number of issues relating to the future of European club rugby competition. "The primary competition would be made up of 20 clubs, with six each from PRL and the LNR, and seven from the Pro12 tournament. "The clubs would come through meritocratic qualification from their respective leagues and, in the case of the Pro12, there will be at least one club guaranteed from each country. "In year one, the 20th place would be allocated through a play-off match between the seventh-placed PRL and LNR clubs. "The secondary competition would consist of up to 20 clubs made up of the remaining 18 PRL, LNR and Pro12 clubs. Two places could be allocated to clubs qualifying from a third competition. "There is also consensus that distributable revenues generated through the competitions would be divided one third, one third, one third per league with the stipulation that monies to be received by the Pro12 countries would not be less than the current levels." The PRL, the LNR and the four Welsh regions have not yet been consulted on the proposals and it is unclear who will run these proposed European club competitions from next year. </body>

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been fined £8,000 by the Football Association for "improper conduct" during his side's Premier League match against Cardiff on Saturday. Mourinho, 50, was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting during the 4-1 win. He did not appeal and can be in the Stamford Bridge dugout on Sunday. "I accept the fine and against Manchester City I can work," he said. "What the referee wrote is true. I wasn't aggressive, I wasn't offensive, I just had a disagreement." Mourinho had until 18:00 BST on Thursday to contest the charge, but indicated after Chelsea's impressive 3-0 away win against Schalke in the Champions League on Tuesday that he would accept his punishment. "[Referee Taylor] is honest and fair [in the report]," added the Chelsea boss. "What he writes is exactly what happened and exactly why I didn't understand why I went to the stands. And it's exactly why the punishment is just a fine." Mourinho was last ordered to the stands in May when he was Real Madrid manager. He protested after a decision went against his team in the Copa del Rey final defeat by city rivals Atletico. </body>

      <description>A serial killer who killed three teenagers is given a further life term for the murder of a fourth.</description>

      <body>A serial killer who killed three teenagers has been given a further life term for the murder of a fourth. Steven Grieveson, 42, has been convicted of murdering Simon Martin, 14, whose semi-naked body was found in a derelict house in Sunderland in 1990. He is serving three life terms for strangling Thomas Kelly, 18, and David Hanson and David Grieff, both 15. Sentencing him for Simon's murder, the judge at Newcastle Crown Court handed him a 35-year tariff. During the two-week trial, Grieveson had denied the murder, saying the death was an accident. The jury heard Grieveson, who did not give evidence, accepted that he did kill the schoolboy but blamed his actions on an abnormality of mind. In 2012, the fairground worker, formerly of Roker Terrace, Sunderland, told police he took Simon to derelict Gilside House, sexually abused him and then attacked him. He said he had confessed to the killing because it had "haunted" him for 20 years. The court heard all four teenagers were found with ligatures around their necks and their bodies were badly burned. The bodies of Thomas Kelly, David Hanson and David Grieff were found between three and four years after Simon's death. At first it was wrongly thought their deaths were due to experimentation with glue sniffing, and possibly drugs. However, a review of the cases revealed they had been strangled. Grieveson was convicted of their murders in 1996 and handed three life sentences, with a minimum tariff of 35 years. He would have been eligible to be considered for parole in 2031, but the new term means this will not happen until 2048. Sentencing him for Simon's murder, Mr Justice Ramsey said the schoolboy had "everything to live for". "He came from a supportive family, of a father, a mother and a brother," he said. "This was a horrendous attack and murder of an innocent young boy, groomed by you and lured for your sexual pleasure." Speaking after the verdict, Dept Supt Roger Ford, of Northumbria Police, said: "Grieveson is a calculated serial killer whose actions left residents shocked and cast a shadow over the community for many years. "We welcome this verdict and hope that Simon Martin's family and friends now feel that justice has been done." Robert and Jean Martin, Simon's parents, said in a statement: "This is the end of a long journey for us, which will finally give us closure. "Now Grieveson could spend the rest of his days behind bars. "No other family should have to lose a son and suffer the heartache we have had to endure." The families of Grieveson's three other victims said in a joint statement: "Our sons were taken away from us by a cruel man whose despicable actions cost four boys their lives. "Listening to this trial has brought back so many painful memories for us, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to Simon's parents for the pain they have suffered over the last 23 years. "We hope that the outcome of this trial will help them to feel that justice has been done for Simon. "Our sons would be grown men now. We will never forget them and they will live on in our hearts forever." </body>

      <body>A Newcastle United fan who punched a police horse when trouble flared following his side's defeat to Sunderland has been jailed for a year. Barry Rogerson, 45, from Bedlington, Northumberland, squared up to Bud, from West Yorkshire's mounted section, while wearing a scarf over his face. Almost 100 Newcastle fans were charged following clashes with police after the game at St James' Park. Rogerson pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to violent disorder. He was also given a six-year football banning order. Judge Paul Sloan QC, said Rogerson had "had plenty of opportunities to move away [from the horse]". He added: "You stood your ground and attacked the horse by punching it in the head. "There was a risk of serious injury, the officer could easily have been thrown from the horse and could have sustained serious injury." Rogerson previously told the BBC he was "not a thug" and was wearing a scarf across his face to stop the cold wind getting into his mouth after a "filling had dropped out". Ch Supt Gary Calvert said: "The images of Rogerson's behaviour were seen right across the country and further afield through the media and internet coverage of the disorder. "His behaviour is clearly unacceptable and he was widely condemned by law abiding and right thinking members of the public for his actions. "In particular, with the next derby just days away, I'm keen to stress that this demonstrates tough action will be taken against anyone involved in such behaviour." Well-wishers sent Bud, who was not hurt in the attack, presents to his stables and his force's mounted section received messages of support for him on Twitter from concerned members of the public. He will be on duty on Sunday for the Wear-Tyne derby at the Stadium of Light. </body>

      <body>The Dunfermline Building Society is to be merged into its parent company, the Nationwide, with the closure of 25 branches across Scotland. It has looked at duplication where branches are very near each other, and 19 are to be closed for that reason. A further six branches without a nearby alternative will shut. The lender said the change, by next summer, will mean about 90 fewer staff - about a third of the branch workforce. It said it was seeking to avoid redundancies by redeployment. Tony Prestedge, Nationwide's chief operating officer, said: "We have made considerable improvements to our range of products and services, and are now in a position to ensure our members under the Dunfermline brand can have full access to the benefits our other members already enjoy. "It is a logical step to integrate our businesses under one unified, strong, and nationally recognisable brand. "The strength of the Nationwide brand is increasingly compelling and we will offer customers of the Dunfermline a vastly improved proposition. "As well as benefiting from access to our full suite of products and market leading customer service, more people will have access to our strong branch network than at present." The rebranding will take place over one weekend, expected to be in Summer 2014. From the following Monday morning, customers will be able to access their accounts from any Nationwide branded branch and Nationwide's online bank if they have already registered. It has retained Caledonia House, the former headquarters of the Dunfermline Building Society, as a customer service administration and telephone channel centre, for customers across the Nationwide Group. About 300 jobs are to be based at this site. The Dunfermline branches that will be integrating with nearby Nationwide branches are: Ayr, Coatbridge, Dundee, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Glasgow (Hope St), Glenrothes, Inverness, Kirkcaldy, Leven, Livingston, Montrose, Paisley, Perth, Shawlands and Stirling. The Nationwide branches that will integrate with nearby Dunfermline branches are: Cupar, Dunfermline and Hamilton. The Dunfermline branches that will be rebranded Nationwide are: Aberdeen, Anniesland, Edinburgh, Kirkwall, Peebles, Petreavie and St Andrews. The Dunfermline branches that will close are: Castle Douglas, Cowdenbeath, Johnstone, Largs, Rosyth and Tranent. </body>

      <body>Scotland's most senior police officer has pledged to do more to improve road safety in light of a surge in offences. Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said Police Scotland wanted to change the behaviour of drivers who took risks. New figures showed a "significant" increase in the number of road safety offences in the first six months of the new single force, compared with the same period last year. Offences include 52,171 of speeding and 20,440 instances of mobile phone use. There were also 25,451 seatbelt misuse offences. Addressing an audience of road safety experts at the Road Safety Scotland annual seminar in Edinburgh, Sir Stephen said road safety was one of the priorities raised by local communities. "Evidence has shown that regular risky and illegal drivers do not acknowledge the risk they present, or view their own actions as illegal or having any real social impact," he said. "A recent study stated that almost three-quarters of all drivers admitted to risky driving behaviour in the last 12 months and more than half of those admitted to illegal behaviour in relation to speeding, mobile phones and seatbelt use. "There is a common perception among offenders that offences are committed by others, but not by themselves. "Our job is to challenge these perceptions and make people aware that offending behaviour will be dealt with." Sir Stephen said the force would continue to build a trunk roads patrol group throughout the country. "Our focus is on enforcement and by providing a more visible, dedicated resource across our national and local roads networks, we can help deter and detect poor driver behaviour," he said. "Greater enforcement has led to some good early results. However, it is worth remembering that in 2012, 174 people died on our roads - three times more than the homicide rate. "I regard this as simply unacceptable." He added: "We will continue to work with others to improve awareness of road safety and challenge offending behaviour in order to keep people safe on Scotland's roads." </body>

      <body>A former senior officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has said he is ashamed that some members of the force were involved in loyalist killings. However, Raymond White has rejected claims in a new book that there was widespread collusion between members of the security forces and paramilitaries. He said the RUC tried to stop murders. The book, by Anne Cadwallader, claims some members of the RUC and UDR were part of a loyalist gang that killed 120 people in NI between 1972 and 1976. Allegations of security force collusion in Troubles-related murders is not new. But the new publication, Lethal Allies - British Collusion in Ireland, claims there is evidence of collusion on a massive scale between RUC officers and loyalist paramilitaries. It includes extracts from reports by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) - the special police team set up in 2005 to re-investigate thousands of Troubles-related murders. Those extracts said there is indisputable evidence of collusion. But Mr White, a former RUC assistant chief constable and senior RUC Special Branch officer, told the BBC the force did its best to catch anyone involved in murder. "There is no-one more ashamed, as myself and my colleagues, that in actual fact these people were serving amongst other officers who had taken the oath of allegiance to uphold the rule of law, and this small cadre of individuals were actually there breaking the law," Mr White said. However, he added: "I worked in the mid-Ulster area in the 1970s and never, at any shape or time, did I see anything that indicated that anybody condoned what was going on. "We were working day and night to make these people amenable, so for allegations to say that this ran to the top of the organisation - I'd like to see the evidence that actually supports that. "If people have it, put it on the table by all means. We all need to know what happened in those occasions, if that evidence is there," the former RUC officer told the BBC. Danny Kennedy, an Ulster Unionist MLA for Newry and Armagh, also questioned the claims made in Ms Cadwallader's book. "I don't believe that there was institutionalised and systemic collusion operated by either ordinary members of the RUC, or the security forces, or the UDR, or indeed senior command of the RUC," Mr Kennedy said. "Allegation is one thing, evidence is another," the UUP representative added. "I've grown up in south Armagh, I've lived in south Armagh all my life. I have known the experience of living there as a member of the Protestant and unionist community when staying alive, at one stage, was actually a challenge. "I also then, am aware of the challenges that were faced by the security forces in the area that they served and I know of the many, many fine police officers and the many people who served in the UDR and in other regiments who were determined, out of public service, out of public duty, to play their part in defeating terrorism from wherever it came." Mr Kennedy said the publication "fuels a narrative of the Troubles that republicans, particularly, demand we should accept". Anne Cadwallader is a former journalist and researcher with the Pat Finucane Centre. More than 20 families have now lodged complaints about the RUC investigations into the killings with the Police Ombudsman.  </body>

      <body>The family of a 15-year-old boy have described an apology from the Southern Health Trust for the death of their son as "cynical". Conor Mitchell, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was initially treated at Craigavon area hospital. He was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for Sick Children in Belfast. The events following Conor's death are being investigated by the hyponatraemia inquiry in Banbridge, County Down. Health trust lawyers recently apologised to two other families whose deaths are being investigated by the inquiry. Lawyers issued a "full and frank admission of liability" on behalf of the Belfast trust in relation to the death of Claire Roberts, 9, and Adam Strain, 4, but not Conor Mitchell. The development at Banbridge Court house is significant as last week the Southern Health Trust only wrote to the family accepting liability for failing to implement guidelines. That all changed when the legal team acting on behalf of the Southern Health Trust told the family that the trust now accepted there had been some form of seizure activity manifesting itself at the same time as the disease process manifesting itself in Conor's death. The trust also apologised for the lack of communication between themselves and the family. However, in a statement released by their solicitor, Conor's parents say the fact that the trust's admissions and apology have been extracted after ten and a half years and on the eve of hearings into elements of their son's treatment adds to the cynicism. "The trust have admitted they failed to train relevant staff in the guidelines and that even paediatric nurses were not properly trained in these essential elements of care," they said. "To give equivocal admissions on these failings and to continue with the partial admissions is not acceptable to the family." The Southern Health Trust have offered to meet Conor's family. But in response to that offer their solicitors said that the family will be seeking clarification as to what restrictions will be placed on the terms of this meeting as the single previous offer made was subject to substantial restrictions on what the trust were prepared to discuss. According to the solicitor, the family now wants to consider what further steps they can take to investigate the failings in education, record keeping, communication and other aspects of Conor's treatment in Craigavon hospital. "The family firmly believe that the fluid management and the seizures played a significant part in Conor's death. The conflicting evidence will need to be reviewed in detail before further steps are taken," the statement added. The hyponatraemia inquiry is examining the deaths of three children, Adam Strain, Claire Roberts and Raychel Ferguson. It is also investigating the events following the deaths of Lucy Crawford and Conor Mitchell. Conor was admitted to the AandE department of Craigavon Area Hospital on 8 May 2003. All of the children died in hospital. In relation to four of the deaths hyponatraemia is said to be a contributing factor. Hyponatraemia describes an abnormally low level of sodium in the blood which occurs when fluid is not administered properly. </body>

      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <title>'Crimes committed' for home priority</title>
      <description>Some people might be committing minor crimes to get priority housing when they are released from prison, BBC Wales learns.</description>

      <body>Some people might be committing minor crimes to get priority housing when they are released from prison, BBC Wales has learned. In Wales all prisoners are automatically put on a priority list if they are homeless when released, regardless of how long they spent behind bars. It costs Welsh councils £2m a year to house former prisoners. Now Housing Minister Carl Sargeant wants to change the law. In 2001 the Welsh government changed the law to allow homeless ex-prisoners with friends or family in an area to access priority housing in a bid to stop them reoffending. But the Welsh government said this had not worked and it now wanted to make the system harder to abuse. Recent figures show there is a larger proportion of former prisoners on priority lists (14%) than people fleeing domestic violence (11%), people with a mental illness or learning disability (6%) or those leaving care or the armed forces (2%). There is no minimum on how long someone has to spend behind bars so a person could be held on remand for a week, be released and then a council has a duty to house them. "I think if you look hard enough you'll find anything you wish to look for in terms of loopholes in systems," said Housing Minister Mr Sargeant. "I'm sure there will be people out there who would have committed a small crime to do actually that. "The fact of the matter is a person in your local community, waiting on the housing list or homeless, at the moment... is in a worse position than somebody who has just left a prison establishment." Former prisoner Craig Lewis, 23, has spent time in prison for assault, car theft and dangerous driving. With the help of friends and family he now has a place to live and a full-time job. But like many former prisoners he is aware of a practice where people in desperate situations commit minor crimes in a bid to jump the housing queue. "Repeat offenders, they usually offend repeatedly so they can get on the priority list," he said. "Seasonal offenders through the winter, they'll commit as many offences as they can just so they'll get a roof over their head in prison and then they'll be out in two or three months with a flat or maybe in a house with their families." Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP Elfyn Llwyd, who sits on the justice select committee, said if the practice was happening then it underlined there was a crisis in the public housing sector in Wales. "I appreciate that a person who has been in prison does need somewhere to live otherwise he or she might reoffend fairly quickly," he said. "Having said that it does seem to me to be a rather blunt instrument... and I hope the Welsh government and the National Assembly for Wales will review this policy in light of this rather strange finding." </body>

      <title>'Large' military operation in Mali</title>
      <description>French, Malian and UN forces have launched a "large-scale" operation in Mali to prevent a resurgence of "terrorist movements", France's military says.</description>

      <body>French, Malian and UN forces have launched a "large-scale" operation in Mali, France's military says. Spokesman Col Gilles Jaron told the AFP news agency that several hundred French soldiers were involved in the mission in the north of the country. It was aimed at preventing a resurgence of "terrorist movements", he added. On Wednesday, a suicide bomb attack on a UN Stabilisation Mission in Mali (Minusma) base in Tessalit killed civilians and two Chadian peacekeepers. The UN Security Council stressed that those responsible would be held accountable and reiterated its support for Minusma. The Malian leader of a splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Sultan Ould Bady, said it had attacked the base because the Chadians were "working for France". France sent troops to oust Islamist rebels from northern Mali in January. The rebels were quickly pushed back from the main urban centres. Some retreated to hideouts in the mountains and desert, from where they launch occasional attacks. Col Jaron of the French military's general staff said the operation - called "Hydra" - was "the first time we have seen forces of significant size working together" in Mali. Its goal was to "put pressure on any terrorist movement to avoid their resurgence", he added. The colonel stressed that the mission was not linked to any recent attack. "This is one those operations that are conducted regularly... to participate in the stabilisation of the country," he explained. He did not say when the operation started or on which areas it was focused, nor provide exact numbers or details on the forces taking part. A spokesman for the Malian army, Lt-Col Souleymane Maiga told the Reuters news agency: "It's an operation to sweep identified areas in the three northern regions [Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal]. It will last as long as is needed." BBC Africa analyst Mamadou Moussa Ba says this is the first time French troops have publicly been involved in operations against Islamist militants in Mali for several months. France has 3,200 soldiers in the country but plans to reduce the force to 1,000 by February, several months later than originally planned. It handed over responsibility for security to Minusma in July. However, the UN force has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel and has appealed for reinforcements. </body>

      <title>Pirates seize US sailors off Nigeria</title>
      <description>Pirates have seized two US sailors from an oil supply ship near Nigeria, officials say, as the White House says it is concerned by piracy off West Africa.</description>

      <body>Pirates have seized two US sailors from an oil supply ship off the coast of Nigeria, officials say. The captain and chief engineer of the US-flagged C-Retriever were taken on Wednesday by armed men who stormed the boat, they said. US officials said it was not a terrorist act, but were concerned about the rise in piracy off West Africa. In kidnaps in the region, crew members are normally freed unharmed after any oil on board the ships is stolen. US State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf Wednesday's incident was being treated as "an act of piracy" rather than terrorism. Gunmen attacked the C Retriever, an oil supply vessel, near the coastal town of Brass in Nigeria's oil rich Bayelsa State. The chief engineer and the captain, both American citizens, were kidnapped. The vessel and 11 other members of the crew were reportedly released. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters: "We are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea." The International Maritime Bureau has recorded more than 40 attacks in the area this year with 132 crew taken hostage. The gangs usually target the oil vessels to steal the cargo. "Pirate networks in the Gulf of Guinea are focusing on product theft from tankers and this relatively new type of crime has evolved into a unique and highly lucrative form of maritime crime," said the Risk Intelligence security firm, in its October report. It is estimated that oil product worth approximately $100m (approximately £62m) has been stolen since 2010. In recent months there have been numerous kidnappings of foreign oil workers and wealthy Nigerians, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region. They have often been held until a ransom payment is made. </body>

      <title>Pakistan 'endorsed US drone strikes'</title>
      <description>Secret US documents show senior Pakistani government officials have known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes for years, a US newspaper reports.</description>

      <body>Secret US documents reveal that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes, an American newspaper reports. The Washington Post said it had obtained CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos which indicated officials were routinely given classified briefings. Pakistan has responded by repeating its opposition to drone strikes. Analysts have long suspected Pakistan gave tacit consent for such strikes. Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has publicly urged US President Obama to halt such attacks. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," Mr Sharif said after the two met on Wednesday. The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington. They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public, and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty. The Pakistani government has responded to the report by repeating its opposition to US drone strikes "Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue," the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement. "We regard such strikes as violation of our sovereignty as well as international law," it said, adding that they were also counterproductive. The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as "talking points" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked "top secret" they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme "tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks". A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment. Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed. In 2010 the controversial whistleblowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had "quietly acquiesced" with drone strikes even though they had publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: "I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it." But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing hitting a location "at the request of your government". There is also a reference to a "network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort". The number of civilian casualties in drone strikes has long been a source of dispute. Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove. One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials. Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan were responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, "posed no threat to life". Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed. The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it took "extraordinary care" to ensure they complied with international law and that they were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians have been killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. But in their meeting on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". </body>

      <body>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says. The charity, Action Aid, says many survivors have serious injuries that have prevented them returning to work. More than 1,130 people died when the Rana Plaza building near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, collapsed in April. Action Aid, questioned nearly two-thirds of survivors and victims' relatives for its survey. It found that 94% of those questioned said they had received no legal benefits from their employers, including sick pay or compensation. It also found that 92% of survivors had not gone back to work, with 63% of those reporting physical injuries including amputations, paralysis and severe pain. Of those surveyed, 92% said they were deeply traumatised. Until now, Primark is the only company that has provided financial support to victims - about £118 ($191) each to 3,300 people, according to Action Aid. The company has said it will continue to pay wages to those affected for three more months. The Action Aid survey found that survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster were facing severe financial difficulty. More than half said they had mounting debts, and more than 90% said they had no savings. Retailers in the EU and the US have pledged since April to improve working conditions in factories they use in Bangladesh, but negotiations between trade unions and retailers over long-term compensation have yet to produce a deal. On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi government and the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a further initiative to improve the safety of buildings and prevent fires in the clothing industry. The $24m (£15m), three-and-a-half-year plan is to be funded by the British and Dutch governments. The ILO has been tasked with bringing together numerous measures aimed at improving working conditions, the BBC's Mahfuz Sadique reports from Dhaka. But he says that a fire at a textile plant earlier this month has highlighted once more the dangers still faced by workers. Bangladesh is reported to be the world's second largest exporter of ready-made clothes behind China. Latest government figures put the annual value of those exports at $21.5bn. The Rana Plaza collapse was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. </body>

      <body>Six racing pigeons in Belgium were found to have been doped with drugs such as cocaine and painkillers, newspapers in the country say. They said that the doping was revealed when the Belgian pigeon-racing federation sent samples from 20 birds to the National Horseracing Authority of Southern Africa. The newspapers said that the birds tested positive for numerous drugs. Pigeon racing in Belgium is a highly lucrative sport. In May a Belgian racing pigeon called Bolt - named after Olympic gold-winning Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt - was sold to a Chinese businessman for a world record price of 310,000 euros (£260,000: $400,000). It was thought that the buyer wanted to use Bolt for breeding more birds. Correspondents say that the riches and glamour connected with racing pigeons have brought many problems, including thefts from breeders and racketeering. Reports say that the doping of the birds was only unearthed in South Africa - tests carried out in Belgium did not reveal a problem. The sport revolves around specially bred and trained pigeons released from a specific location and racing back to their home loft. </body>

      <title>French clubs to strike over tax row</title>
      <description>French clubs in the top two divisions will go on strike for four days in November in protest at 'super taxes'.</description>

      <body>French clubs will go on strike in November in protest at plans to impose higher taxes on players' wages. The government wants a 75% 'super tax' on those earning an annual salary of more than 1m euros (£850,000) . Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of professional clubs' union UCPF, said: "There will be a weekend without a game at the end of the month (November)." The strike will affect matches in Ligue 1 and 2 - the top two divisions - from 29 November to 2 December. Under the proposal, companies, rather than individuals, would be liable to pay the 75% tax rate for the part of employees' annual salaries that exceed 1million euros. Paris St-Germain, who are backed by Qatar investors, will be the hardest hit by the tax. Monaco, who are funded by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, will be exempt as they do not fall under French tax laws. The concern among clubs is that the 'super tax' will deter footballers from playing for sides in France. The issue will be debated in parliament, and French president Francois Hollande will meet representatives of the French clubs next week to discuss the issue. Initial plans were for individuals earning more than 1million euros to pay the 75% rate, but the government changed the proposals after protests by top French executives and actors such as Gerard Depardieu. Ligue 1 clubs registered a loss of 108 million euros (£92m) at the end of the 2011-12 season with the accumulated loss over the last three seasons amounting to 303m euros (£259m). Louvel added: "There is already a deficit in our sector and now they impose a new tax. Football has a role in society and that will be affected as a consequence of these new measures. "This unprecedented day is an opportunity for the silent majority of French football to express their opposition." </body>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>Clowns gathered at a convention in Mexico City have denied any of their colleagues were behind the killing of a former drug cartel leader last Friday. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. Gunmen dressed as clowns opened fire on the former leading member of the once-powerful and violent Tijuana cartel, authorities say. Around 500 clowns at the convention held a "laugh-a-ton" rally for peace. A clown leader said if a real member of the profession had been involved in the shooting, they would have been easily identifiable by their costumes, masks and painting. "The people who do that, they're not clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown," Tomas Morales, whose stage name is Clown Llantom, told Associated Press news agency. They say clowns are frequently victims of robberies and their costumes and masks are then used to commit other crimes. The attack against Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>At least 48 female prisoners have been released by the Syrian government in one of the final stages of a complex three-way hostage deal, reports say. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the government of President President Bashar al-Assad had freed them over the last two days. Al-Jazeera broadcast footage of what it said were some of them being released. Meanwhile electricity is slowly returning to Damascus after a rebel attack on a gas pipeline. The attack caused widespread power cuts and set off a huge blaze near the city's international airport. The northern city of Aleppo and the central city of Homs were also affected. There has been no immediate comment from Syrian officials in relation to the reported releases, nor are there any details as to who the women are or where they are now located. The UK-based SOHR said the releases were part of a hostage swap last week brokered by Qatar and the Palestinian Authority. It resulted in nine Lebanese citizens - who were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to President Assad - being released on Sunday. The rebels insisted their hostages were fighters with the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, and were demanding the release of women detainees in exchange. Lebanese gunmen also freed two Turkish pilots on Sunday as part of the three-way deal. Officials in Lebanon say that a third part was the release of the women. Correspondents say that the involvement of Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Qatar and the Palestinian Authority in the deal showed the extent to which the crisis in Syria - now in its third year - has spread across the wider region. It is clear that huge effort has gone into producing the complicated deal, correspondents say. The Syrian conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and created more than two million refugees. While the war rages on the hostage exchange creates a small glimmer of hope, correspondents say, as efforts intensify to arrange a peace conference in Geneva next month. </body>

      <body>At least four people have been killed in Tripoli, Lebanon, in fighting between supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gunmen have been trading fire between the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the Alawite district of Jabal Muhsin since Monday. Dozens of people have been injured in the violence, officials say. The adjacent neighbourhoods have witnessed sporadic clashes since the Syrian conflict began in early 2011. President Assad is a member of the Alawite sect and is fighting a Sunni-led revolt. Tripoli, with a small Alawite community living in the midst of a Sunni majority, is seen as one of Lebanon's most volatile sectarian faultlines. A security official said the Lebanese army was "responding to all sources of fire", AFP news agency reported. "Snipers are hiding on the rooftops and in the streets," it quoted the unnamed official as saying. On-off fighting between the two districts have claimed scores of lives over the past two years. </body>

      <title>US healthcare IT contractors grilled</title>
      <description>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website tell lawmakers that the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches.</description>

      <body>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website have told lawmakers the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches. One senior executive told a congressional panel that the federal government was "the ultimate responsible party". The panel also heard that two contractors wanted more testing before the 1 October launch of the website. The Obama administration is in damage-control mode over the troubled rollout. Amid the fallout, the White House late on Wednesday announced it would push back by six weeks the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Thursday's testimony before the House energy and commerce committee began with Republican legislators arguing that the healthcare.gov website flaws were part of wider problems in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare. "The American people deserve something that works, or start over," Representative Tim Murphy said, suggesting that the law be suspended until the problems are fixed. The website is one part of the larger law, which includes increased requirements for insurance firms, a requirement that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and subsidies for those who qualify to assist in the cost of the insurance. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office previously said about seven million people would gain coverage through the federal website and other run by some states during the first year of operation. Democrats have lamented the technical issues but have defended the law, while criticising Republican attempts to undermine it. "Republicans don't have clean hands coming here," Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said. The website's glitches were overshadowed by a 16-day government shutdown, which began after Republicans tried to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship in Congress. On Thursday, Cheryl Campbell, a senior vice-president of the Canadian-firm CGI, which created the front-end portion of the website, said that overwhelming interest from consumers had triggered the website problems. "No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature" Ms Campbell said. But she also blamed administration officials, saying the health department should have served as the "quarterback" on the project and was the "ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance". Andy Slavitt of QSSI, which created several elements of the online healthcare exchange, said a late decision to require consumers to create accounts before they could browse insurance plans contributed to the slow, malfunctioning website. "This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously," Mr Slavitt said. Republican Representative Joe Pitts questioned this decision, pointing out that "window-shopping" was widely used in e-commerce, including in another government healthcare website for the elderly. "Who made that decision? When was it made? Why was it made?" Mr Pitts asked during the hearing. And some Democrats on the panel said they were frustrated with both the government's and contractors' handling of the situation. Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents the Silicon Valley area, said it was a "lame excuse" to blame the website's problems on a crush of visitors. "Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas," Ms Eshoo said. "ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day." And Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette said: "These problems need to be fixed, and they need to be fixed fast." Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius travelled to an Arizona health centre on Thursday to rally support for the law. Republicans in Congress have called for her resignation over the website problems. Ms Sebelius and other government officials are set to testify in front of legislators in a hearing next week. She was ridiculed earlier this month during an appearance on The Daily Show when the host Jon Stewart pulled out a laptop and said: "I'm going try and download every movie ever made, and you're going to try and sign up for Obamacare and we'll see which happens first." In response to the outcry over the technical issues, the administration will begin daily status briefings on the system, starting on Thursday. On Wednesday, US health officials admitted the online system did not get enough testing before going live on 1 October, especially at higher volumes. The health law also allowed individual states to set up their own online insurance exchanges. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia went with this option - those websites have not reported so many problems. </body>

      <body>A student accused of murdering a Massachusetts high school maths teacher used a box cutter to stab her before disposing of her body, US media report. Philip Chism, 14, was charged on Wednesday as an adult over the death of Colleen Ritzer, 24, whose body was found in woods behind the school. The Boston Globe reports that school CCTV cameras showed the accused pushing a recycling bin through the building. It is not known if Ritzer's body was inside. She was found dead in woods behind the school, after being reported missing late on Tuesday. Danvers High School, in a suburb of Boston, reopened on Thursday for students to speak to counsellors. Classes will resume on Friday. Officials said Ritzer and the suspect knew each other from the school, but did not elaborate. Gardner Trask, chairman of the Danvers Board of Selectmen, told the Associated Press news agency the killing is a "devastating blow" to the close-knit town. On Wednesday evening the Boston Red Sox held a moment of silence for Ritzer before the first game of the World Series, America's professional baseball championship. And hundreds of people attended a candlelit vigil at the school's car park, wearing pink clothes or bows in tribute to Ritzer's favourite colour. Ritzer reportedly lived in her family home with her younger brother and sister. Her family said they were mourning the death of their "amazing, beautiful daughter and sister". "Everyone that knew and loved Colleen knew of her passion for teaching and how she mentored each and every one of her students," the family said in a statement. Ritzer was said to be friendly towards the school's students, many of whom were not much younger than her. Her Twitter biography describes the maths teacher as "often too excited about the topics I'm teaching". She used the account to set homework for students. The suspect's family and lawyer have not spoken to reporters. The accused had moved to Massachusetts from the state of Tennessee before the start of the school year. He was said to be a star player on the school soccer team. One student, Kyle Cahill, told the Associated Press the suspect's absence had been noted at a team dinner on Tuesday night. "We're all just a family. It just amazes me really," said Kyle. "He wasn't violent at all. He was really the opposite of aggressive." Ritzer's death is the latest incident this week to send police scrambling to a US school: A Gallup poll released on Wednesday suggested that 25% of US parents are concerned about their children being harmed while at school, making it one of their top crime concerns. </body>

      <title>Coffee v smoothies: Which is better for you?</title>
      <description>Which drink is better for your health?</description>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee. Trust Me I'm A Doctor is broadcast on BBC Two at 20:00 BST on Thursday 24 October, or catch up with iPlayer Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Michael Mosley answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskMichael. Q: The article seems to conflate smoothies and juices re lack of fibre. Does fibre in a handmade smoothie blunt insulin? A: Commercial juices and smoothies are lower in fibre than eating fruit and veg. Handmade ones may be better but will still be lower than fruit and veg. Eating apples will keep you feeling full for longer than drinking same amount as apple juice. I met someone who takes it to the extreme. He peels the apple, eats the peel, throw rest away. Q: Why do you persist in offering fad diets when we have the examples of sportsmen who just eat right and exercise? A: The simple message, "eat less, do more exercise" simply doesn't work with most people. It's time to acknowledge that. Q: Is it ok to eat 4 fruits each day, eg: banana, grapes, apple, orange? Is this too much sugar? A: Banana and grapes have lots sugar. Apples, pears and berries have less sugar. Vegetables generally have lower GI and calories. Commercial smoothies are often banana based, so they have lots of sugar and calories. Q: What is worse? High fat, low carbohydrate or high carbohydrate low fat diets? A: I think the important thing is the type of carbohydrates and type of fat. Highly processed food is bad. Q: It seems what we are told is either good or bad for us changes like the wind. How do we know what to believe? A: The problem is that many health beliefs are based on poor studies. The best option is a prospective cohort study. In a prospective cohort study you follow people over time, not at a moment in time. When this was done for coffee drinking it was shown to be mildly beneficial. Q: I only ever have proper butter, never spreads or margarine. Do I need to only have tiny amounts though? A: I eat butter rather than margarine, as do many cardiologists I know. But it's rich in calories, so I am restrained. Q: Any good news on the horizon for chronic migraine? A: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we looked at Botox which seems to work quite well for chronic migraine. Q: Drinking enough water is important, but how important is the pH value in tap water? A: The idea we should drink 2 litres a day is a myth. Drink when you're thirsty. I don't know about the effect of pH in water. Q: Is one banana a day too many? A: No. Eating fruit is generally good. Q: Yes or no, should we drink pure fruit smoothies? A: I don't. If it tastes sweet it has lots of sugar. Some have more than 10 teaspoons of sugar. </body>

      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns seven Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <body>Soul legend Edwin Starr had worldwide success in the 1960s and 70s with hits including the classic protest song War. But the Nashville-born singer spent the final years of his life thousands of miles from the Motown heartland of Detroit. He died in Chilwell - on the outskirts of Nottingham - in 2003. A decade later, Starr's younger brother Angelo Starr and manager Lilian Kyle look back on his life and chart his unusual journey to the English suburbs.

      <body>What do an Australian accountant living in south-west London, a 65-year-old sheep farmer in Wales, and council tenants in a rural Lincolnshire district have in common? The answer is a passion for energy efficiency that means that they will not be hit as hard as most by the latest round of gas and electricity price rises. They have built or live in properties where the insulation drastically reduces the need for heat. "You have to plug the gaps, otherwise it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket," says Peter Urquhart, the Aussie who has created an eco home in North Cheam. His project is no grand design, but a two-bedroom, timber-framed bungalow which his neighbours refer to as "the shed". Close to completion in a suburban estate opposite a primary school, only the modern chimneys protruding from the slanting low-rise roof give any clue that this property is different. But inside, skylights mean the rooms are filled with natural light and there is a ventilation system which allows the stale air going out to heat the fresh air coming in. Solar panels lay flat against the roof, creating energy for the underfloor heating. "It is unusual, but it is a home at the end of the day," says 36-year-old Mr Urquhart. The project, he says, took a lot more time, energy and money than he expected. Yet, for him, the reward is displaying an example of what can be done. It is not, he admits, a template for every home in the UK. After all, not everyone has the opportunity to build from scratch, or has the finance to spend upfront. Yet, the Energy Saving Trust says there are small changes that people can make to their homes to make them more energy efficient, and cut bills. They include the use of energy saving lightbulbs, turning off unnecessary lights, setting the washing machine to 30C, or wrapping hot water tanks in decent insulation. Mr Urquhart's motivation was his concern for the environment - a view shared by his wife Lucy. The result is a property which, he estimates, has only a third of the energy needs of an equivalent Victorian home - and 40% of them are provided by the solar panels. The arrival of three-month-old daughter Molly means they have changed their plans to move in, so now they want to sell before embarking on a similar eco home project elsewhere. He is not the only one looking to mirror the design of an energy efficient property. Sheep farmer Anthony Porter has planning permission to build three cottages on his land in the historic county of Radnorshire in Wales. He built the first after reading about American settlers who, despite a shortage of timber, built homes that lasted for more than 100 years. Their, and his, choice of building material was bales of straw. With the price-lifting, profit-making energy industry being portrayed as the big bad wolf, the house made of straw may have worked after all. Lanterns, wind-up torches, a shower warmed by propane gas, and a wood-burning stove nullify the need for mains gas or electricity. The two-bedroom holiday cottage, nestled in idyllic countryside, was built during eight months of huff and puff by Mr Porter and a builder through the winter of 2012. Now it is hired by holiday-makers looking for a break from the gadgets and gizmos of modern life. Mr Porter says it is more fire resistant than a timber-framed house, and carries no greater insurance premium than a standard cottage. The walls are plastered with lime mortar and the roof space is insulated with sheep's wool, meaning the whole building, excluding the land and his own labour, cost Mr Porter £31,700. "It was quite a leap of faith," he admits. It was even more of a gamble for the councillors of North Kesteven in Lincolnshire to spend taxpayers' money on building the first straw bale social housing in the country in 2010. But, after looking at the figures, they were convinced it would pay off. The three-bedroom family homes each had a building budget of £110,000, which the council says is £20,000 less than a brick-built home of the same size. They also feature sheep's wool insulation, solar panels and triple glazing, resulting in an average saving of 44% in running costs, the council estimates. Critics of straw bale homes say that the thickness of the walls means there is less space in the house than with more standard walls. The need to keep them free of leaks and moisture is also vital. More significantly, most homeowners and tenants do not have the opportunity to bypass big energy bills in the same way, especially if they are living in draughty, Victorian homes. While these projects provide an advert for insulation, very few people have signed up to the Green Deal - a scheme in England, Wales and Scotland through which householders can borrow money to install double-glazing, loft insulation, and more efficient boilers. Enthusiasts of self-built homes argue that building a home from scratch means a range of energy efficient installations would be easier to include than in older homes. Self-build is a sector being encouraged by the government with tax breaks, despite the fact that those who want to build their own homes often complain of a shortage of land, planning difficulties, and a lack of mortgage products to finance the project. "With the lack of new homes being built at the moment, you would have thought more lenders would be offering self-build mortgages. Many of the banks and building societies quietly pulled out of the market citing a lack of demand for their mortgages," says Aaron Strutt, of mortgage brokers Trinity Financial. And there is an added irony. The energy companies are suggesting that government-imposed "green" levies are getting more expensive and are pushing up bills for consumers. There is little doubt that before a solution is reached, and before eco homes become less of a novelty, household energy costs will keep on rising. </body>

      <title>The older workers who keep going</title>
      <description>'I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home'</description>

      <body>As his 80th birthday approached, Bob Hooker decided to slow down a little. Instead of eight hours a day of painting and decorating, he asked his son and business partner if he could cut down a little - to just seven hours a day. But when big jobs needed to be finished, he still finds himself putting in extra hours up his ladder to get it done. "I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home," he says. "I feel sorry for people that have to retire." And a growing number feel the same way. According to official figures, there are 32,000 people in the UK who are in their 80s and still hard at work, a figure that has increased by more than half in the past 10 years. And as the post-war baby boom generation reach their mid-60s, it's becoming increasingly common to work past what used to be the official retirement age. Just over one million people are still working past the age of 65, and 324,000 of those are 70 and over. There are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60. But better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead. Not everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though. For Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss. But for big employers, it's not so simple. The NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers. In England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday. It's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages. But would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions. The government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048. As a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates. But many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload. He loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire. "I do need the money," he says. "If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough." The self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do. Many of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want. But if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them. There are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want. And in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers after the state retirement age was abolished. But older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old. And many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years. It's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher. And if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker. For many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned. </body>

      <description>The Japanese men who prefer virtual girlfriends to sex</description>

      <body>Unless something happens to boost Japan's birth rate, its population will shrink by a third between now and 2060. One reason for the lack of babies is the emergence of a new breed of Japanese men, the otaku, who love manga, anime and computers - and sometimes show little interest in sex. Tokyo is the world's largest metropolis and home to more than 35 million people, so on the face of it, it is hard to believe there is any kind of population problem at all. But Akihabara, an area of the city dedicated to the manga and anime subculture provides one clue to the country's problems. Akihabara is heaven for otaku. They are a generation of geeks who have grown up through 20 years of economic stagnation and have chosen to tune out and immerse themselves in their own fantasy worlds. Kunio Kitamara, of the Japan Family Planning Association, describes many young Japanese men as "herbivores" - passive and lacking carnal desire. It seems they no longer have the ambition of the post-war alpha males who made Japan such an economic powerhouse and no interest in joining a company and becoming a salary man. They have taken on a mole-like existence and, worryingly, withdrawn from relationships with the opposite sex. A survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2010 found 36% of Japanese males aged 16 to 19 had no interest in sex - a figure that had doubled in the space of two years. I met two otaku, who believe themselves to be in relationships with virtual girlfriends. This girlfriend is actually a Nintendo computer game called Love Plus, which comes as a small portable tablet. Nurikan and Yuge take their girlfriends, Rinko and Ne-ne, on actual dates to the park, and buy them cakes to celebrate their birthdays. "It's the kind of relationship we wish we'd had at high school," says Nurikan. In the game he is a 15-year-old, though in reality he is 38. "As long as I have time, I'll continue the relationship forever," says Yuge, who is 39. "As she's at high school, she picks me up in the morning and we go to school together. After school we meet at the gates and go home together... In the game I am 17." Yuge says he often puts Ne-ne - or the games console containing her - into the basket of his bicycle, then he takes photographs of them at his destination. Though Yuge would like to meet a real woman, and Nurikan is married, they say this is easier than having a real girlfriend. "At high school you can have relationships without having to think about marriage," says Yuge. "With real girlfriends you have to consider marriage. So I think twice about going out with a 3D woman." Nurikan says he keeps Rinko a secret from his wife, and hopes he never has to choose between them. It's hard to avoid feeling that otaku are in a perpetual state of childhood and are quite comfortable with their lives this way. Exactly why they have retreated into fantasy land is not obvious. Tokyo-based social commentator Roland Kelts says many young Japanese men are pessimistic about the future. They don't believe they will match their parents' wealth and don't want to commit themselves to relationships. "If you compare China or Vietnam, most of those kids on scooters going to nightclubs, and dancing their heart away and perhaps having sex - they know it's getting better, they know they are probably going to rock their parents' income," he says. "No-one in Japan feels that way." Several surveys have shown that even when Japanese men and women are in relationships, they have very little sex. In one survey just 27% said they had sex every week. Marriage rates are also plunging, and very few babies - only 2% - are born out of wedlock. Japan's demographic timebomb is also linked to the lack of immigration. In Britain one in eight people were born abroad, compared to one in 60 in Japan. But immigration in Japan is still heavily restricted, despite a dearth of some qualified workers. In Britain there are 60,000 healthcare workers from overseas, while in Japan - where there is a serious shortage of nurses - there are only 60. Japan has managed to preserve its unique culture in an increasingly globalised world but could that very sense of identity stand in the way of solving its population problems? Or is it just time for Japanese men to grow up, have more sex and make more babies? Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <body>"Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable," said Mark Twain. The same could be said of all the power lists that are published, which are based on informed conjecture. They are a publishing construct, designed to draw attention to a publication and (typically) its specialism. Today sees the publication of Art Review's Power 100, now in its twelfth year. The spin it has given to this year's chart, which is topped by Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani of Qatar, is that a power shift is taking place in the art world - away from publically-funded museums to the private wealth of individuals and collectors. I'm not sure that's quite right. Or, at least, new. Wealthy individuals have always been major players, from the Medici to Peggy Guggenheim; King George IV to Charles Saatchi. I don't think it's so much a power shift that's happening between public and private - more that the two worlds are converging. To take a recent example, the Qatari royal family sponsored the Tate's Damien Hirst retrospective. It's now moved to Doha, where Tate director Nicholas Serota attended the official launch. It's a symbiotic relationship based on mutual benefit, but one that has led to money being prized over art. It's telling that there are no artists in the top five of Art Review's list. The means has become the end. Quite what Sheikha Al-Mayassa is planning to do with the trophy western art works she is buying is anyone's guess. The 30-year old sister of the new Emir has been head of the Qatar Museums Authority for several years now. She has overseen the completion of the excellent Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, the creation of a museum of modern Arab art, and is in overall charge of an exhibition programme that currently sees the Al Riwaq gallery space covered in Damien Hirst spots. All of this is in the public domain. Information about her acquisitions of modern and contemporary western art is not. There has been much (informed) speculation as to what she has bought. Major works by Warhol, Bacon, Rothko, Koons and Hirst are all thought to have made their way over to Qatar. As has, it is thought, Cezanne's Card Players (1895), the only one of this wonderful series not already in a museum collection, for which it is said, she paid a record-breaking $250 million. What will become of these paintings and sculptures? Are they for private enjoyment, or perhaps to form the basis of a collection for a new museum of modern art to open in time for the 2022 World Cup? And why are the Qataris spending so much on art (more than anyone else in the world according to the Art Newspaper and its art market expert Georgina Adam)? International status and influence would appear to be a factor, along with a desire to compete with Abu Dhabi and Sharjah for the role as the region's cultural centre. Becoming a destination for tourism - both local and global - is likely to be part of the business plan: An investment made with the riches gained from selling oil and gas to prepare Qatar's economy for the time when those natural resources are less plentiful. And, finally, to deliver on the Qatar National Vision 2030, as set out by her father, which aims to "build a bridge between the present and the future." The idea being to move the tiny state, in which there are only about 300,000 Qataris, from an oil and gas economy to a one that is knowledge-based. </body>

      <title>Bustling market towns hold the secret of happiness</title>
      <description>Do market towns hold key to happiness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24650757</url>

      <body>Britain's bustling market towns are hailed as the places containing the secrets of happiness. New government research on life satisfaction concludes that cities and smaller towns should try to replicate the community spirit, thriving high streets and social networks of large rural and market towns. Data released by the Office for National Statistics reveals that the least happy areas in the UK are Harlow and Brentwood - both in Essex. The happiest are Fermanagh and Moyle, both in Northern Ireland. But why should that be? Identifying the factors that are linked to high levels of life satisfaction is one of the aims of the government's well-being programme. The idea is that ministers can then tailor policies to fit. What today's government analysis reveals is that happier places tend to have lower levels of ill-health, crime and unemployment. So far, so unsurprising. They also have higher levels of retired people and young couples without children. Among other factors linked positively to life satisfaction are "working from home", a rural community and volunteering. Among the negative factors are "women working full time", lone parent households and higher numbers of newly settled migrants. The data only identifies correlation rather than cause, so it may be that the correlation with the number of migrants, for example, may reflect an area's relative deprivation. The places with highest levels of life satisfaction tend to be larger than a small town but smaller than a city. The happiest places of all, it turns out, are larger rural or market towns. The government analysis suggests some of the benefits of market town living be "designed into" other communities. Among the official advice to ministers is the delivery of public services in ways which meet people's needs for social contact - fewer call centres, more real people, perhaps - creating thriving high streets and promoting volunteering. Above all, it seems, the secret of market towns' high well-being levels is their sense of distinct identity, community spirit and perfect size - small enough for people to feel included but large enough to remain private. </body>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <title>Women 'better multitaskers' than men</title>
      <description>It's not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, and employers should bear this in mind, say the authors of a new study.</description>

      <body>It's not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking, or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric circles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <title>Seven-planet solar system found</title>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered the seventh planet orbiting a distant star.</description>

      <body>Astronomers may have identified one of the richest planetary systems yet. The discovery of a seventh planet around the dwarf star KIC 11442793 could be a record, according to two separate teams of researchers. The system bears some similarities to our own, but all seven planets orbit much closer to their host star, which lies some 2,500 light-years from Earth. The crowded solar system is described in two papers published on the pre-print server Arxiv.org. One of the identifications was made by volunteers using the Planet Hunters website. The site was set up to allow volunteers to sift through the public data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which was launched to search for so-called exoplanets - worlds orbiting distant stars. Kepler uses the transit method to discover new planets, which entails looking for the dip in light as an alien world passes in front of its host star. But there is simply too much data for mission scientists to examine every light curve, so they developed computer programmes to search for the signature of a planetary transit. "This is the first seven-planet system from Kepler, using a transiting search. We think [the identification] is very secure," said Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, co-author on the Planet Hunters paper. "With a transiting system, once you get multiple planets, the odds of them being false positives are very small." Dr Lintott's team has submitted their research to the Astronomical Journal for peer review. Another team of astronomers from several European countries has submitted a separate paper outlining their independent discovery of the seventh planet to the Astrophysical Journal. The new planet is the fifth furthest from its parent star, orbiting with a period of nearly 125 days. With a radius of 2.8 times that of the Earth, it fits into a family that now includes two roughly Earth sized worlds, three "super-Earths" and two larger bodies. "It actually looks like our Solar System in one sense, with all the small planets on the inside and the big planets on the outside. And that's not necessarily what we always see," said co-author Robert Simpson, also from Oxford University. While there might be resemblances to our Solar System, all seven planets are closer to their host star. In fact they would all fit within the Earth's distance from the Sun, making this a very crowded neighbourhood. "This is one of the reasons they are easy to see, because the closer they are to their sun, the more frequently they go around it," said Dr Simpson. However, the Planet Hunters team carried out simulations showing that the planetary system should be a stable one. Dr Lintott, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme and helped found Planet Hunters, added: "Everything we know about this system tells us [the seventh planet] should have been found using the automatic detection routines. But it wasn't." "A seven-planet system is very complicated so you get a sense of why the automatic routine might have missed out - it gets confused by the presence of the other transits. "Looking for these transits seems like a task that's perfectly designed for computers. But we keep finding, in these niche cases, in these odd cases, in these complicated cases that humans can beat the computers." Another star, HD 10180, has been claimed to have either seven, or nine planetary signals. A distant sun called GJ 887C may also have a family of seven planets. Commenting on the paper by the Planet Hunters team, Andrew Collier Cameron, professor of astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: "It's intriguing that a system as well-studied as KOI-351 can still harbour hidden surprises that can only be winkled out by human eyes." He added: "This is a perennial problem in transit hunting, of which we are only too acutely aware in our own ground-based searches. "The best transit signal-detection algorithms developed to date still come a very poor second to the human visual system when it comes to pattern recognition. Still, we have to rely on machines, because of the sheer volume of data produced by enterprises like transit searches." Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <title>National Trust 'open' to fracking</title>

      <body>National Trust director-general Dame Helen Ghosh says the conservation charity has an "open mind" about allowing fracking on its land. Her comments appear to contradict the Trust's position of a "presumption against" the controversial technology. Campaigners say the environmental risks of fracturing rock to release gas are too great. A spokesman says the Trust has not changed its position but will review any new evidence in the future. Fracking is the process of drilling down into shale rock before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. In an interview with The Times Newspaper, Dame Helen said: "We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it we would reach a view." She added: "We are waiting for the evidence. We have an open mind." However, the Trust's position on fracking says: "We have a presumption against fracking on our land because natural gas is a fossil gas. "The mining process also gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts." It goes on to say: "Whilst the use of natural gas might buy time to develop secure, renewable alternative energy sources, it also risks distracting us from focusing on the development of these and on the need for us all to concentrate on using less energy in the first place. 'Fool's gold' A Trust spokesman said: "Our position is a presumption against fracking on our land. "It doesn't mean that in time that won't change - if the environmental and visual impacts are negligible and it is part of a strategy to move to a low carbon economy." The Trust adopted its position of a presumption against the gas/oil extraction technique during the summer's anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, where energy company Caudrilla planned to carry out test drilling. Earlier this year, the charity's director of conservation, Peter Nixon, described fracking as "fool's gold". He said: "If it takes our eyes off the ball from the need for energy efficiency and a long-term sustainable source of renewable energy, it will be fool's gold." The spokesman told BBC News: "Shale gas is a fossil fuel [that] may prove a fool's gold and distract attention from a shift to renewables. "The environmental and visual impacts are also unproven, and this is what concerns many people. We want to see more evidence on what this impact will be." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The badger cull in Gloucestershire is to be extended for eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>‘Most distant galaxy’ discovered</title>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>
      <description>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." Here Dr Jochen Smolka from the University of Lund in Sweden, describes the findings. </body>

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever take to the skies again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>

      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns seven Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>Merkel hits out over spying scandal</title>
      <description>Germany's chancellor says it is "really not on" for friends to spy on each other, as an EU summit is overshadowed by a row over US surveillance.</description>

      <body>Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it is "really not on" for friends to spy on each other, referring to alleged US snooping on her phone calls. On arrival at an EU summit in Brussels Mrs Merkel said "we need trust between allies and partners, and such trust needs to be restored". She said she had given that message to US President Barack Obama when they spoke on Wednesday. Other EU leaders also voiced concern about the scale of US surveillance. The spying row threatens to overshadow EU talks on economic growth and migration to the EU. Mrs Merkel has demanded a "complete explanation" of the claims, which came out in the German media. She grew up in former communist East Germany, where secret police surveillance was pervasive. Her delegation in Brussels confirmed she had met briefly to discuss the issue with France's President Francois Hollande, who has expressed alarm at reports that millions of French calls have been monitored by the US. There is concern that the furore could jeopardise EU-US talks on reaching a major free trade deal. The head of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), Sigmar Gabriel, said such a deal was hard to imagine if the US had infringed citizens' privacy. The SPD is in coalition talks with Chancellor Merkel. In a separate development, Italy's weekly L'Espresso reported that the US and UK had been spying on Italian internet and phone traffic. The revelations were sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden. It is alleged that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and UK spy centre GCHQ eavesdropped on three undersea cables with terminals in Italy. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta described the allegations as "inconceivable and unacceptable" and said he wanted to get to the truth of them. Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again Edward Snowden was the source of the report. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the alleged spying on Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls was "serious" and added: "I will support her (Merkel) completely in her complaint and say that this is not acceptable - I think we need all the facts on the table first." Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen echoed him, saying: "We have to get clarification of what has happened and we also need a guarantee that this will never happen again, if it has happened." Germany summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the alleged spying. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said about his meeting with US envoy John Emerson that he had demanded straight answers from Washington, warning that their friendship is at stake. Mrs Merkel discussed the issue with President Obama on Wednesday. He told her the US was not monitoring her calls and would not in future, the White House said. However, it left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright said the spying allegations were "not a surprise to people - countries spy on each other", and added that France had spied on her when she was in government. The formal agenda for the summit focuses on efforts to consolidate Europe's fragile economic recovery and to create a single market in digital services. British Prime Minister David Cameron will also call on the EU to reduce regulations for business. But France's President Hollande pressed for the spying issue to be put on the agenda. The veteran French EU Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC that "enough is enough", and confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The digital economy is on the official summit agenda for Thursday evening. One of the key initiatives of the European Commission is its Digital Agenda for Europe, which it says "aims to reboot Europe's economy and help Europe's citizens and businesses to get the most out of digital technologies". Council officials say investment in the digital economy is vital to boost growth, which is creeping back to the European economy. They want to address market fragmentation and a perceived shortage of IT skills. Mr Cameron is likely to use the economic discussion to raise what Britain sees as a proliferation of red tape. He said last week: "All too often EU rules are a handicap for firms," and that small business owners "are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless, burdensome and costly regulations". The European Commission - which makes the rules - has recognised that it may have gone too far in some places. President Jose Manuel Barroso says he wants the EU to be "big on big things and smaller on smaller things". He says the Commission has cut more than 5,000 legal acts in the past five years and wants to do more. On Friday the leaders will discuss relations with central European countries, ahead of a November summit in Lithuania where new agreements will be signed. Migration will also be discussed, following the loss of hundreds of lives among migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. </body>

      <title>'Little help' for Bangladesh victims</title>
      <description>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says.</description>

      <body>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says. The charity, Action Aid, says many survivors have serious injuries that have prevented them returning to work. More than 1,130 people died when the Rana Plaza building near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, collapsed in April. Action Aid, questioned nearly two-thirds of survivors and victims' relatives for its survey. It found that 94% of those questioned said they had received no legal benefits from their employers, including sick pay or compensation. It also found that 92% of survivors had not gone back to work, with 63% of those reporting physical injuries including amputations, paralysis and severe pain. Of those surveyed, 92% said they were deeply traumatised. Until now, Primark is the only company that has provided financial support to victims - about £118 ($191) each to 3,300 people, according to Action Aid. The company has said it will continue to pay wages to those affected for three more months. The Action Aid survey found that survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster were facing severe financial difficulty. More than half said they had mounting debts, and more than 90% said they had no savings. Retailers in the EU and the US have pledged since April to improve working conditions in factories they use in Bangladesh, but negotiations between trade unions and retailers over long-term compensation have yet to produce a deal. On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi government and the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a further initiative to improve the safety of buildings and prevent fires in the clothing industry. The $24m (£15m), three-and-a-half-year plan is to be funded by the British and Dutch governments. The ILO has been tasked with bringing together numerous measures aimed at improving working conditions, the BBC's Mahfuz Sadique reports from Dhaka. But he says that a fire at a textile plant earlier this month has highlighted once more the dangers still faced by workers. Bangladesh is reported to be the world's second largest exporter of ready-made clothes behind China. Latest government figures put the annual value of those exports at $21.5bn. The Rana Plaza collapse was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. </body>

      <title>Portuguese police reopen McCann case</title>
      <description>Portugese police reopen their inquiry into 2007 disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann from a beach resort in the country.</description>

      <body>Portuguese police have reopened their inquiry into the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, the public prosecutor's office has said. Madeleine, from Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared from Praia da Luz in the Algarve in May 2007. Portugal's attorney general said "new elements of evidence" justified the "continuation of the investigation", which was shelved by police in 2008. Madeleine's parents said they hoped for "the answers we so desperately need". Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 - codenamed Operation Grange - and opened a formal investigation in July this year. Portuguese police said a review team had been working since March 2011 to look back through information from the original investigation - and this process had uncovered potential new lines of inquiry. The decision comes after Scotland Yard said at a briefing earlier this year that the Portuguese inquiry would not be re-opened until judges there were convinced there were solid grounds to do so. It would appear that this decision is highly significant, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood met senior Portuguese police in Lisbon last Thursday for a briefing on the new lines of enquiry, which are "separate" to those being followed by the Met. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were also briefed on the case during the meeting. They said they were "very pleased" the Portuguese inquiry, which will run alongside the Met operation, was being reopened. "We hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime," they said. "We once again urge any member of the public who may have information relating to Madeleine's abduction to contact the police in Portugal or the UK." Mr Rowley, assistant commissioner for specialist crime and operations, said the meeting was "very positive" and both forces had a "shared determination" to solve the case. "I believe that we have the best opportunity yet to finally understand what happened to Madeleine," he said. UK Home Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: "I hope what we are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie's parents and family." Clickable map and timeline Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment on 3 May 2007, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby tapas bar. The three-year-old and her brother and sister were left in the apartment at 20:30, with their father checking on them at 21:05. Mrs McCann raised the alarm at 22:00 when she realised Madeleine was gone. Since then there has been much speculation about what happened to the youngster. In July, the Met said new evidence had come to light, and last week an appeal launched on BBC Crimewatch prompted 2,400 responses. Met detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. The Met are offering a £20,000 reward for information. They say their inquiries have led to the "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. On Wednesday, Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe defended the way Portuguese police had handled the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. "I'm sure for them that must have been a challenge. Anybody can go back after two, three, five, six years and say 'why didn't you do that'? That's easy in hindsight," he said. </body>

      <title>'Large' military operation in Mali</title>
      <description>French, Malian and UN forces have launched a "large-scale" operation in Mali to prevent a resurgence of "terrorist movements", France says.</description>

      <body>French, Malian and UN forces have launched a "large-scale" operation in Mali, France's military says. Spokesman Col Gilles Jaron told the AFP news agency that several hundred French soldiers were involved in the mission in the north of the country. It was aimed at preventing a resurgence of "terrorist movements", he added. On Wednesday, a suicide bomb attack on a UN Stabilisation Mission in Mali (Minusma) base in Tessalit killed civilians and two Chadian peacekeepers. The UN Security Council stressed that those responsible would be held accountable and reiterated its support for Minusma. The Malian leader of a splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Sultan Ould Bady, said it had attacked the base because the Chadians were "working for France". France sent troops to oust Islamist rebels from northern Mali in January. The rebels were quickly pushed back from the main urban centres. Some retreated to hideouts in the mountains and desert, from where they launch occasional attacks. Col Jaron of the French military's general staff said the operation - called "Hydra" - was "the first time we have seen forces of significant size working together" in Mali. Its goal was to "put pressure on any terrorist movement to avoid their resurgence", he added. The colonel stressed that the mission was not linked to any recent attack. "This is one those operations that are conducted regularly... to participate in the stabilisation of the country," he explained. He did not say when the operation started or on which areas it was focused, nor provide exact numbers or details on the forces taking part. A spokesman for the Malian army, Lt-Col Souleymane Maiga told the Reuters news agency: "It's an operation to sweep identified areas in the three northern regions [Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal]. It will last as long as is needed." BBC Africa analyst Mamadou Moussa Ba says this is the first time French troops have publicly been involved in operations against Islamist militants in Mali for several months. France has 3,200 soldiers in the country but plans to reduce the force to 1,000 by February, several months later than originally planned. It handed over responsibility for security to Minusma in July. However, the UN force has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel and has appealed for reinforcements. </body>

      <title>Maria 'parents' give DNA to police</title>
      <description>A Bulgarian couple suspected of being the biological parents of Maria, the blonde girl found in a Greek Roma community, have given their DNA to police.</description>

      <body>A Bulgarian couple suspected of being the biological parents of Maria, the young girl found in a Roma community in Greece, have been questioned by police. Officials said they had taken DNA samples and were investigating whether the woman had sold the child, a crime that could result in a jail sentence. The couple have been named by Bulgarian media as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev, from the central town of Nikolaevo. A woman believed to be Ms Ruseva has admitted giving up a baby in Greece. But she denied to Bulgarian TV reports that she had received payment for the girl four years ago. She could not say for definite that Maria was hers, but said she burst into tears when she saw the girl on news reports. Maria bears a striking resemblance to some of her other children. Maria came to the Greek police's attention after they raided the Roma camp near Farsala in central Greece last week. They were initially searching for drugs and weapons, but noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents. They found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been 8,000 inquiries following an appeal to identify her, and the international police body Interpol has been involved in the search for her biological family. The couple believed to be Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev, and their eight children, were filmed by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek town of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back anytime you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she left her child with. Prosecutors announced they had pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". "A DNA test has been taken from Ruseva, and information has been collected about her trips to Greece in the last years,'' said a statement from the prosecutor's office. Greek news site zougla.gr earlier published what it said was the identity card of Ms Ruseva and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <body>At least four people have been killed in Tripoli, Lebanon, in fighting between supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Gunmen have been trading fire between the Sunni district of Bab al-Tabbana and the Alawite district of Jabal Muhsin since Monday. Dozens of people have been injured in the violence, officials say. The adjacent neighbourhoods have witnessed sporadic clashes since the Syrian conflict began in early 2011. President Assad is a member of the Alawite sect and is fighting a Sunni-led revolt. Tripoli, with a small Alawite community living in the midst of a Sunni majority, is seen as one of Lebanon's most volatile sectarian faultlines. A security official said the Lebanese army was "responding to all sources of fire", AFP news agency reported. "Snipers are hiding on the rooftops and in the streets," it quoted the unnamed official as saying. On-off fighting between the two districts have claimed scores of lives over the past two years. </body>

      <body>A Chinese newspaper has published a front-page plea - for the second time in two days - for the release of one of its journalists held by police. The New Express again called for Chen Yongzhou to be freed. Mr Chen was taken away by police after he wrote about a part state-owned construction equipment company. In a rare move, China's publishing regulator has also voiced its concern over his detention. The New Express, based in the southern city Guangzhou, published on the bottom of its front page a large four-character headline that read: "Again: Please Release Him." On Tuesday, the paper filled its front page with a three-character headline that read "Please Release Him." The paper also accompanied the second day's plea with a call to resolve matters under the rule of law. "[Police] cannot take way people first and question them later," the paper said. Correspondents say the paper's move is rare and bold at a time when the government is tightening control over the media and the internet. Meanwhile, China's publishing regulator, the General Association of Press and Publishing (GAPP), has voiced its concern over Mr Chen's detention. GAPP "resolutely supports the news media conducting normal interviewing and reporting activities and resolutely protects journalists' normal and legal rights to interview," the China Press and Publishing Journal said, citing a GAPP official. "At the same time, it resolutely opposes any abuse of the right to conduct interviews," said the journal which is overseen by GAPP. The article said the association was paying "close attention" to the matter. Earlier this year, Mr Chen wrote several reports about Zoomlion, which is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government. Zoomlion issued a statement after one New Express article, which alleged it had improperly accounted for sales, caused its share price to drop. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange in late May, the company called the claims "false, groundless and misleading". Like all Chinese newspapers, the New Express comes under strict state control, but it has nonetheless gained a reputation for investigative journalism, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai. Recent years have seen sporadic clashes between Chinese media outlets and the authorities. In January, journalists at the Guangdong-based Southern Weekly newspaper called for a propaganda chief to quit, after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute. The row sparked small protests and displays of solidarity from other media outlets before the issue was resolved. </body>

      <title>Pakistan 'endorsed US drone strikes'</title>
      <description>Secret US documents show senior Pakistani government officials have known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes for years, a US newspaper reports.</description>

      <body>Secret US documents reveal that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes, an American newspaper reports. The Washington Post said it had obtained CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos which indicated officials were routinely given classified briefings. Pakistan has responded by repeating its opposition to drone strikes. Analysts have long suspected Pakistan gave tacit consent for such strikes. Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has publicly urged US President Obama to halt such attacks. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," Mr Sharif said after the two met on Wednesday. The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington. They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public, and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty. The Pakistani government has responded to the report by repeating its opposition to US drone strikes "Whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past, the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue," the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement. "We regard such strikes as violation of our sovereignty as well as international law," it said, adding that they were also counterproductive. The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as "talking points" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked "top secret" they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme "tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks". A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment. Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed. In 2010 the controversial whistleblowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had "quietly acquiesced" with drone strikes even though they had publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: "I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it." But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing hitting a location "at the request of your government". There is also a reference to a "network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort". The number of civilian casualties in drone strikes has long been a source of dispute. Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove. One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials. Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan were responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, "posed no threat to life". Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed. The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it took "extraordinary care" to ensure they complied with international law and that they were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians have been killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. But in their meeting on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". </body>

      <title>Suu Kyi: Burma's 'climate of fear'</title>

      <body>Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has blamed what she described as a "climate of fear" for exacerbating tensions between Muslims and Buddhists. Asked about the fate of 140,000 Muslims who have been forced to leave their homes, she said that many Buddhists had also fled Burma, also known as Myanmar. Ms Suu Kyi denied that Muslims had been subjected to ethnic cleansing. She has been criticised for not defending Muslims since she emerged from house arrest two years ago. Over the past two years, violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims has broken out in the state of Rakhine. There have also been clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in central Burma. Muslims have borne the worst of the violence, with hundreds killed, often by mobs armed with knives and sticks. "I think the problem is due to the fear felt by both sides," she told the BBC's Mishal Husain. "Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence. "This fear is what is leading to all this trouble." She said tensions had also been inflamed by a worldwide perception - also felt in Burma - that global Muslim power was "very great". She said that it was down to the government to bring an end to the violence and the return of Buddhist refugees who had been forced to leave the country in recent years to escape political persecution. "This is the result of our sufferings under a dictatorial regime. I think that if you live under a dictatorship for many years people do not like to trust one another - a dictatorship generates a climate of mistrust," she said. Ms Suu Kyi said that the effective implementation of the rule of law was essential. "Before people can sit down and sort out their differences they have to feel safe. If they feel that they are going to be killed in their beds they are not going to talk about harmony or learn to understand one another." She said that Burma still had a long way to go before becoming fully democratic. "People assume too readily that on a path to democracy - that we are democratising at a fast rate - but it is not happening like that at all." </body>

      <body>Russia's chief sanitary inspector, Gennady Onishchenko has been removed from his post and given a new job. A spokeswoman for the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, denied that Mr Onishchenko had been dismissed. She said his contract had ended and he had now been appointed as an adviser to the prime minister. During his tenure, Mr Onishchenko was widely known for making a number of controversial decisions regarding food products from neighbouring countries. Correspondents say he used his position at the Rospotrebnadzor agency to punish countries which disagreed with Russia. But Mr Onishchenko has always denied that political motives influenced the measures taken by the agency. In March 2006 Russia banned the imports of wine and mineral water from Georgia, citing contamination of some shipments and warning of risks to health. The move came at a time of deteriorating relations between the two countries as Georgia took a more pro-Western stance and stated it wanted to join the Western military alliance, Nato. A similar stance was taken against Belarussia in 2009 as the country moved closer towards the European Union. The Russian food agency reacted by banning the export of vegetables on health grounds. In August this year, Mr Onishchenko banned chocolate imports from Ukraine's largest confectioner, saying its products fell below safety standards. Correspondents say the decision coincided with the uneasy relationship over energy supplies, and may also have been in retaliation for Kiev's import duties on Russian cars and attempts to set up a customs union. This month Lithuania - as it prepares to host an EU summit aimed at forging closer ties with neighbouring countries - was told its dairy products would be banned because they did no longer met the necessary quality standards. He also recommended avoiding sushi because of a risk of tapeworms and he proposed killing crows, which he described as feathered wolves, for allegedly spreading bird flu. </body>

      <body>The Ukrainian WBC heavyweight boxing champion, Vitali Klitschko, has confirmed he will run in the country's 2015 presidential election. He made his announcement in response to a bill passed in parliament that bars candidates who have lived outside Ukraine during the past 10 years. The pro-Western Udar party MP has permanent resident status in Germany. "Everything that has taken place in parliament today... does not intimidate me and will not stop me," he said. "To head off these various schemes and attempts at getting even with me as a possible candidate, I want to declare this: I will run for president." Mr Klitschko is the first declared contender against the incumbent, Viktor Yanukovych. He has actively campaigned against what he calls the president's "authoritarian policies". The bill adopted on Wednesday amended Ukraine's current tax code. It now states that if a Ukrainian national holds permanent resident status in another country they cannot be considered a resident of Ukraine. Previously, they only had to live in Ukraine for at least 180 days a year. According to the constitution, a presidential candidate must have been resident in Ukraine for 10 years prior to polling day. Mr Klitschko said the amendment clearly had a "political context", something denied by a member of Mr Yanukovych's Party of Regions. The 42-year-old boxer heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms (Udar), whose acronym means "Punch". It came third in last year's parliamentary elections. "My main goal is for Ukraine to be a European, modern country with European standards of life," Mr Klitschko told the BBC in August. "I will decide with people who have the same vision, the same dream, to go into politics and from the inside to change the situation." He has spoken out against corruption in the country and the jailing of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko for abuse of office - a charge that her supporters claim was politically motivated. "We can't be a democratic country with political prisoners," he said. Mr Klitschko is also pushing to strengthen Ukraine's links with the EU. "We see our future in the European family. We are European with our mentality, with our history," he said. </body>

      <title>French clubs to strike over tax row</title>
      <description>French clubs in the top two divisions will go on strike for four days in November in protest at 'super taxes'.</description>

      <body>French clubs will go on strike in November in protest at plans to impose higher taxes on players' wages. The government wants a 75% 'super tax' on those earning an annual salary of more than 1m euros (£850,000) . Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of professional clubs' union UCPF, said: "There will be a weekend without a game at the end of the month (November)." The strike will affect matches in Ligue 1 and 2 - the top two divisions - from 29 November to 2 December. Under the proposal, companies, rather than individuals, would be liable to pay the 75% tax rate for the part of employees' annual salaries that exceed 1million euros. Paris St-Germain, who are backed by Qatar investors, will be the hardest hit by the tax. Monaco, who are funded by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, will be exempt as they do not fall under French tax laws. The concern among clubs is that the 'super tax' will deter footballers from playing for sides in France. The issue will be debated in parliament, and French president Francois Hollande will meet representatives of the French clubs next week to discuss the issue. Initial plans were for individuals earning more than 1million euros to pay the 75% rate, but the government changed the proposals after protests by top French executives and actors such as Gerard Depardieu. Ligue 1 clubs registered a loss of 108 million euros (£92m) at the end of the 2011-12 season with the accumulated loss over the last three seasons amounting to 303m euros (£259m). Louvel added: "There is already a deficit in our sector and now they impose a new tax. Football has a role in society and that will be affected as a consequence of these new measures. "This unprecedented day is an opportunity for the silent majority of French football to express their opposition." </body>

      <body>Six racing pigeons in Belgium were found to have been doped with drugs such as cocaine and painkillers, newspapers in the country say. They said that the doping was revealed when the Belgian pigeon-racing federation sent samples from 20 birds to the National Horseracing Authority of Southern Africa. The newspapers said that the birds tested positive for numerous drugs. Pigeon racing in Belgium is a highly lucrative sport. In May a Belgian racing pigeon called Bolt - named after Olympic gold-winning Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt - was sold to a Chinese businessman for a world record price of 310,000 euros (£260,000: $400,000). It was thought that the buyer wanted to use Bolt for breeding more birds. Correspondents say that the riches and glamour connected with racing pigeons have brought many problems, including thefts from breeders and racketeering. Reports say that the doping of the birds was only unearthed in South Africa - tests carried out in Belgium did not reveal a problem. The sport revolves around specially bred and trained pigeons released from a specific location and racing back to their home loft. </body>

      <description>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website tell lawmakers that the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches.</description>

      <body>Contractors who worked on the much-maligned US healthcare website have told lawmakers the Obama administration must share the blame for its glitches. One senior executive told a congressional panel that the federal government was "the ultimate responsible party". The panel also heard that two contractors wanted more testing before the 1 October launch of the website. The Obama administration is in damage-control mode over the troubled rollout. Amid the fallout, the White House late on Wednesday announced it would push back by six weeks the healthcare law's requirement for individuals to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. Thursday's testimony before the House energy and commerce committee began with Republican legislators arguing that the healthcare.gov website flaws were part of wider problems in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare. "The American people deserve something that works, or start over," Representative Tim Murphy said, suggesting that the law be suspended until the problems are fixed. The website is one part of the larger law, which includes increased requirements for insurance firms, a requirement that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and subsidies for those who qualify to assist in the cost of the insurance. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office previously said about seven million people would gain coverage through the federal website and other run by some states during the first year of operation. Democrats have lamented the technical issues but have defended the law, while criticising Republican attempts to undermine it. "Republicans don't have clean hands coming here," Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said. The website's glitches were overshadowed by a 16-day government shutdown, which began after Republicans tried to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship in Congress. On Thursday, Cheryl Campbell, a senior vice-president of the Canadian-firm CGI, which created the front-end portion of the website, said that overwhelming interest from consumers had triggered the website problems. "No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature" Ms Campbell said. But she also blamed administration officials, saying the health department should have served as the "quarterback" on the project and was the "ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance". Andy Slavitt of QSSI, which created several elements of the online healthcare exchange, said a late decision to require consumers to create accounts before they could browse insurance plans contributed to the slow, malfunctioning website. "This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously," Mr Slavitt said. Republican Representative Joe Pitts questioned this decision, pointing out that "window-shopping" was widely used in e-commerce, including in another government healthcare website for the elderly. "Who made that decision? When was it made? Why was it made?" Mr Pitts asked during the hearing. And some Democrats on the panel said they were frustrated with both the government's and contractors' handling of the situation. Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents the Silicon Valley area, said it was a "lame excuse" to blame the website's problems on a crush of visitors. "Amazon and eBay don't crash the week before Christmas," Ms Eshoo said. "ProFlowers doesn't crash on Valentine's Day." And Democratic Congresswoman Diana DeGette said: "These problems need to be fixed, and they need to be fixed fast." Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius travelled to an Arizona health centre on Thursday to rally support for the law. Republicans in Congress have called for her resignation over the website problems. Ms Sebelius and other government officials are set to testify in front of legislators in a hearing next week. She was ridiculed earlier this month during an appearance on The Daily Show when the host Jon Stewart pulled out a laptop and said: "I'm going try and download every movie ever made, and you're going to try and sign up for Obamacare and we'll see which happens first." In response to the outcry over the technical issues, the administration will begin daily status briefings on the system, starting on Thursday. On Wednesday, US health officials admitted the online system did not get enough testing before going live on 1 October, especially at higher volumes. The health law also allowed individual states to set up their own online insurance exchanges. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia went with this option - those websites have not reported so many problems. </body>

      <body>A student accused of murdering a Massachusetts high school maths teacher used a box cutter to stab her before disposing of her body, US media report. Philip Chism, 14, was charged on Wednesday as an adult over the death of Colleen Ritzer, 24, whose body was found in woods behind the school. The Boston Globe reports that school CCTV cameras showed the accused pushing a recycling bin through the building. It is not known if Ritzer's body was inside. She was found dead in woods behind the school, after being reported missing late on Tuesday. Danvers High School, in a suburb of Boston, reopened on Thursday for students to speak to counsellors. Classes will resume on Friday. Officials said Ritzer and the suspect knew each other from the school, but did not elaborate. Gardner Trask, chairman of the Danvers Board of Selectmen, told the Associated Press news agency the killing is a "devastating blow" to the close-knit town. On Wednesday evening the Boston Red Sox held a moment of silence for Ritzer before the first game of the World Series, America's professional baseball championship. And hundreds of people attended a candlelit vigil at the school's car park, wearing pink clothes or bows in tribute to Ritzer's favourite colour. Ritzer reportedly lived in her family home with her younger brother and sister. Her family said they were mourning the death of their "amazing, beautiful daughter and sister". "Everyone that knew and loved Colleen knew of her passion for teaching and how she mentored each and every one of her students," the family said in a statement. Ritzer was said to be friendly towards the school's students, many of whom were not much younger than her. Her Twitter biography describes the maths teacher as "often too excited about the topics I'm teaching". She used the account to set homework for students. The suspect's family and lawyer have not spoken to reporters. The accused had moved to Massachusetts from the state of Tennessee before the start of the school year. He was said to be a star player on the school soccer team. One student, Kyle Cahill, told the Associated Press the suspect's absence had been noted at a team dinner on Tuesday night. "We're all just a family. It just amazes me really," said Kyle. "He wasn't violent at all. He was really the opposite of aggressive." Ritzer's death is the latest incident this week to send police scrambling to a US school: A Gallup poll released on Wednesday suggested that 25% of US parents are concerned about their children being harmed while at school, making it one of their top crime concerns. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>Clowns gathered at a convention in Mexico City have denied any of their colleagues were behind the killing of a former drug cartel leader last Friday. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. Gunmen dressed as clowns opened fire on the former leading member of the once-powerful and violent Tijuana cartel, authorities say. Around 500 clowns at the convention held a "laugh-a-ton" rally for peace. A clown leader said if a real member of the profession had been involved in the shooting, they would have been easily identifiable by their costumes, masks and painting. "The people who do that, they're not clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown," Tomas Morales, whose stage name is Clown Llantom, told Associated Press news agency. They say clowns are frequently victims of robberies and their costumes and masks are then used to commit other crimes. The attack against Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>Pirates have seized two US sailors from an oil supply ship off the coast of Nigeria, officials say. The captain and chief engineer of the US-flagged C-Retriever were taken on Wednesday by armed men who stormed the boat, they said. US officials said it was not a terrorist act, but were concerned about the rise in piracy off West Africa. In kidnaps in the region, crew members are normally freed unharmed after any oil on board the ships is stolen. US State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf Wednesday's incident was being treated as "an act of piracy" rather than terrorism. Gunmen attacked the C Retriever, an oil supply vessel, near the coastal town of Brass in Nigeria's oil rich Bayelsa State. The chief engineer and the captain, both American citizens, were kidnapped. The vessel and 11 other members of the crew were reportedly released. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters: "We are concerned by the disturbing increase in the incidence of maritime crime, including incidents of piracy off the coast of West Africa, specifically in the Gulf of Guinea." The International Maritime Bureau has recorded more than 40 attacks in the area this year with 132 crew taken hostage. The gangs usually target the oil vessels to steal the cargo. "Pirate networks in the Gulf of Guinea are focusing on product theft from tankers and this relatively new type of crime has evolved into a unique and highly lucrative form of maritime crime," said the Risk Intelligence security firm, in its October report. It is estimated that oil product worth approximately $100m (approximately £62m) has been stolen since 2010. In recent months there have been numerous kidnappings of foreign oil workers and wealthy Nigerians, especially in the oil-producing Niger Delta region. They have often been held until a ransom payment is made. </body>

      <title>SA apology over Zuma's Malawi jibe</title>
      <description>South Africa's government apologises for remarks President Jacob Zuma made on Monday about Malawi, amid a diplomatic row between the neighbours.</description>

      <body>South Africa has apologised for controversial remarks President Jacob Zuma made on Monday about Malawi. Mr Zuma was widely quoted in the media as saying that "this is Johannesburg. It's not some national road in Malawi". He made the comment as he tried to convince people to accept plans to impose tolls on highways around Johannesburg. On Wednesday, Malawi summoned South Africa's top diplomat in Lilongwe to protest about the remark. South African high commissioner Cassandra Mbuyane-Mokone explained to Malawi Foreign Affairs Minister Ephraim Mganda Chiume that Mr Zuma had been quoted out of context, said Malawian foreign ministry spokeswoman Quent Kalichero. "As far as we are concerned the issue is resolved. It's now water under the bridge. Malawi and South Africa enjoy good relations," Ms Kalichero told the BBC. Malawi is one of Africa's poorest states, with many of its nationals working in South Africa, the regional power. Speaking at a meeting organised by the governing African National Congress (ANC) on Monday, Mr Zuma reportedly said: "We can't think like Africans in Africa, generally. This is Johannesburg. It's not some national road in Malawi." South Africa's public broadcaster, SABC, reports that Mr Zuma's spokesman Mac Maharaj has apologised to those who felt offended by the comments. International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said South Africa will never look down on another African country, SABC quotes her as saying. While South Africa has many toll roads, the government is facing strong public opposition to its plan to introduce, for the first time, electronic tolling for roads between Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria. Many commuters, backed by businessmen and unionists, say it will increase travelling costs exorbitantly, something they cannot afford. The government upgraded existing motorways in and around Johannesburg for the 2010 football World Cup. It says the work was not free, and it now wants the electronic tolling system to retrospectively finance the roads. </body>

      <title>India 'royals' end bitter dispute</title>
      <description>Agreement is reached in a multi-billion dollar dispute between members of one of India's most illustrious former royal families, lawyers say.</description>

      <body>An acrimonious multi-billion dollar dispute between members of one of India's most illustrious former royal families over palaces, diamonds and other valuable items has been settled, lawyers and family members say. They say the agreement brings an end to more than 20 years of family feuding. Members of the Gaekwad family have signed a memorandum of understanding. The case is the second major dispute involving the billion dollar assets of a former Indian royal family this year. In July the daughters of a former Indian maharaja won a 21-year court battle to inherit more than $4bn (£2.6bn) worth of assets after a court in the city of Chandigarh said the will of Harinder Singh Brar, Maharaja of Faridkot - who died in 1989 - had been forged. His assets included a 350-year-old royal fort and a private aerodrome. In the latest such case, a judge in the western city of Vadodara presided over an agreement that includes a palace which is reportedly four times the size of Britain's Buckingham Palace. "We took the decision for the betterment of our families and are satisfied with the outcome and hope we will overcome the past and forge a new relationship," Samarjitsinh Gaekwad told reporters after the signing of the memorandum. The dispute began in 1991 between Sangramsinh Gaekwad and his brother, Ranjitsinh Gaekwad. Their father was the last king of the state of Baroda, who ruled until independence from Britain in what is now the western state of Gujarat. Their grandfather, Maharajah Sayyaji Rao III is remembered for a daring act of dissent against the British monarch in India in 1911. The bitter legal tussle involved more than 20 members of the sons' extended families - and continued, despite Ranjitsinh Gaekwad's death in May 2012, between Sangramsinh Gaekwad and his nephew Samarjitsinh Gaekwad. "Both... have reached a settlement with regard to the royal property and have signed the settlement deal before the judge in Vadodara court," Samarjitsinh's lawyer, AV Avadhut, told reporters. Samarjitsinh and his family will keep the famous Laxmi Vilas Palace, built in 1890 and one of India's largest private dwellings. In addition they will retain the palace's surrounding 600 acres (243 hectares) estate that reportedly includes a golf course. Samarjitsinh will also control the museum at the palace with its paintings, diamonds and valuable jewellery. Sangramsinh and his family will assume control of private companies, along with land and real estate including the Indumati Mahal palace in Vadodara and the property in Mumbai where he and his family are based. More properties will be divided between the four Gaekwad sisters , with local media estimating the total assets as worth the equivalent of $3bn (£1.86m). </body>

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. Tributes have been pouring in for the legendary singer from the government, the film industry and his fans. President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led the country in paying tributes to Dey. India "has lost a veteran playback singer, a versatile artist of extraordinary ability and a creative genius who mesmerised listeners with his enchanting voice," the president said. The prime minister described Dey as the "king of melody" and said with his death, the music world had lost one of its most talented artistes. "I am deeply saddened to hear of the demise of the King of Melody, Manna Dey. An accomplished singer with a unique voice, he was multi-talented and excelled in Rabindra Sangeet and various other forms of popular music," he said in his condolence message. "In his death, the music world has lost one of its most talented artistes. Dey's legacy will, however, live on through the many songs he sang," Mr Singh added. Dey sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen; Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan; and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Dey's peers from Bollywood and fans took to Twitter to pay tribute to the singer. "Today, great classical singer Manna Dey sahab, who we fondly called Manna da, is not among us anymore. He had a very pleasant and easy personality. He was very dedicated to his work. I salute him and pray that his soul rests in peace," singer Lata Mangeshkar, who collaborated on innumerable hits with him, wrote on Twitter. Mangeshkar's duet Pyar hua ikraar hua (I admit I'm in love), played as background to film of actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis on a rainy night under an umbrella in Shri 420, is among the most popular romantic songs of Bollywood. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. RIP," tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP." Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." Dey, a Bengali, also charmed neighbouring Bangladesh with songs in his mother tongue and in a message on Thursday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Dey would remain alive forever among music-loving people of the subcontinent. "People will never forget his extraordinary melodious voice and unique style," she said. </body>

      <body>Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans" during their home Champions League match against Manchester City. City midfielder Yaya Toure said he was subjected to racist chanting during his team's 2-1 win in Moscow on Wednesday. The European governing body says the case will be dealt with by its disciplinary board on 30 October. CSKA Moscow consider the racism allegations to be "unfounded". Manchester City said on Thursday that they had submitted a formal written complaint to Uefa, which is also looking into the setting off of fireworks by home supporters during the match in the Russian capital. In May, Uefa announced that in the case of racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure would be applied for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (£42,800). CSKA's next home game in the Champions League is against Bayern Munich on 27 November, before which they visit Manchester City on 5 November. Ivory Coast international Toure said he was "furious" and reported the chants to the referee during the game and afterwards. But CSKA are "surprised and disappointed" by Toure's claims. A club statement read: "Having carefully studied the video of the game, we found no racist insults from fans of CSKA." CSKA spokesman Michael Sanadnze told BBC Radio 5 live: "We have nothing to hide, of course, and we have confirmation from the match delegate and the venue director that they themselves didn't hear anything special." Lord Ouseley, chairman of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, said the latest incident would "test" Uefa's new sanctions. He added referee Ovidiu Hategan should not officiate again after failing to follow protocol when Toure reported the incidents to him. Under guidelines issued by Uefa in 2009, referees have the power to tackle racist chanting from supporters in a number of ways. As a first step, they can stop a match and ask for warnings to be made over the public address system. The second step is to suspend a match for a short time. If the abuse continues, a match can be abandoned. Romanian official Hategan, a Fifa referee since 2008, was also in charge when Lazio fans were found guilty of racist behaviour towards Tottenham players in the Europa League last season. FIFPro, the global union for professional footballers, is "disappointed" match officials failed to act. And Ouseley said if players are not adequately protected, more could walk off the pitch during a game, as former AC Milan player Kevin Prince-Boateng did during a friendly last season. Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Maria Miller told BBC Sport she was concerned by the incident given Russia is due to host the World Cup in 2018. She said: "When countries like Russia are going to be very shortly hosting the World Cup, it's important we know a tough line is going to be taken." Norwich manager Chris Hughton was allegedly subjected to racist abuse on Twitter recently. When asked whether he believed Uefa were doing enough to stop the problem of racism, he said: "Well I don't think so, because it is still happening. "They need to put themselves in the position of those that are being targeted. "Penalties these days seem to be fines, fines are very easily paid, particularly by the bigger clubs. "Do we need harsher penalties? Absolutely we do… but Uefa have a real good opportunity to act."

      <description>Romanian prosecutors charge a communist-era labour camp commander with genocide, a month after charging a prison commander with the same crime.</description>

      <body>Romanian prosecutors have charged a second communist-era prison commander, Ion Ficior, with genocide. Mr Ficior was in charge of the Periprava labour camp from 1958 to 1963 where 103 political prisoners died. In September prosecutors charged Alexander Visinescu, head of the Ramnicu Sarat prison between 1956-1963. The general prosecutors' office said Ficior had "introduced and co-ordinated a repressive detention regime, which was abusive, inhuman.'' The charges followed the discovery of five skeletons from unmarked graves near Periprava. Officials reported that there were no coffins, clothes or personal possessions near the bodies. "We have clear evidence, which we gave to the prosecutors already, that Ion Ficior has implemented during his rule at Periprava Prison, between 1958 and 1963, an extermination regime for political detainees, through a lack of medical assistance, a lack of adequate food and the application of poor treatment to the detainees," said Andrei Muraru of the Romanian Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes (IICCMER). Recently Mr Ficior denied that more than 100 people had died in his camp. According to the Associated Press news agency, which interviewed him in June, he remained unrepentant about the treatment of prisoners. On being charged, Mr Visinescu told prosecutors he was only following orders. They say political prisoners where Mr Visinescu was commander experienced beatings, hunger, cold and lack of medical treatment. The head of the IICCMER, Andrei Muraru, said that both Mr Ficior and Mr Visinescu should pay the price for their role in the deaths of hundreds of prisoners. "Both former prison commanders, Visinescu and Ficior, are in their 80s and they can no longer be incarcerated. But they should get a conviction for what they did 50 years ago. That they have been degraded as army men, that they've had their pensions taken away, all these things are very important in a democratic society. We want to show the difference between the totalitarian system these men served and the democratic system that will punish them for it. Regardless of the system they served, murder is murder," he said. About 500,000 Romanians, including priests, teachers, doctors and peasants, were jailed as political prisoners in the 1950s as the communist authorities imposed a totalitarian system. In harsh prison conditions about a fifth of those inmates died, historians say. </body>

      <title>Syria 'releases female prisoners'</title>
      <description>At least 48 female prisoners are released by the Syrian government in one of the final stages of a complex three-way hostage deal, reports say.</description>

      <body>At least 48 female prisoners have been released by the Syrian government in one of the final stages of a complex three-way hostage deal, reports say. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the government of President President Bashar al-Assad had freed them over the last two days. Al-Jazeera broadcast footage of what it said were some of them being released. Meanwhile electricity is slowly returning to Damascus after a rebel attack on a gas pipeline. The attack caused widespread power cuts and set off a huge blaze near the city's international airport. The northern city of Aleppo and the central city of Homs were also affected. There has been no immediate comment from Syrian officials in relation to the reported releases, nor are there any details as to who the women are or where they are now located. The UK-based SOHR said the releases were part of a hostage swap last week brokered by Qatar and the Palestinian Authority. It resulted in nine Lebanese citizens - who were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to President Assad - being released on Sunday. The rebels insisted their hostages were fighters with the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, and were demanding the release of women detainees in exchange. Lebanese gunmen also freed two Turkish pilots on Sunday as part of the three-way deal. Officials in Lebanon say that a third part was the release of the women. Correspondents say that the involvement of Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Qatar and the Palestinian Authority in the deal showed the extent to which the crisis in Syria - now in its third year - has spread across the wider region. It is clear that huge effort has gone into producing the complicated deal, correspondents say. The Syrian conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and created more than two million refugees. While the war rages on the hostage exchange creates a small glimmer of hope, correspondents say, as efforts intensify to arrange a peace conference in Geneva next month. </body>

      <description>A Saudi interior ministry spokesman warns that measures may be taken against any women who take part in a campaign against a ban on female drivers.</description>

      <body>A spokesman for the Saudi interior ministry has warned women that measures may be taken against them if they take part in a campaign against a ban on female drivers. A new campaign to give women the right to drive will culminate in Saudi Arabia this Saturday. Women are being encouraged to take to the wheel in defiance of the ban. It is the third protest of its kind; in the first in 1990, a number of women were arrested or lost their jobs. The interior ministry spokesman, Mansour al-Turki, has considerably toughened the Saudi government line on the women drivers' campaign. A previous statement on Wednesday was confusing, with both those pro- and anti- the campaign believing it favoured them. But now Mr Turki has explicitly restated that women are prohibited from driving, with violators - and their supporters - likely to face unspecified measures. A campaign activist, Zaki Safar, said that this was an unusually explicit statement of the ban, which is informal rather than enshrined in Saudi law. "It is no longer an issue of a social choice - that the government does not itself support the ban," Mr Safar told the BBC. "No, the spokesman was very clear. And any woman who drives on the 26th will face punishment." But Mr Safar believes the government is still sending mixed messages, as it is itself divided over whether to lift the ban. Earlier this week, about 100 conservative clerics asked for an audience at the royal court in the capital, Riyadh, to denounce the campaign as a conspiracy by women and a threat to the country. But there have been indications of a less hardline attitude by the authorities than back in 1990, and at the second protest in 2011. As part of the latest campaign, dozens of women have posted online videos of themselves driving in different Saudi cities. None of them has been arrested. The activists behind the campaign believe the public mood is changing, with many more people - including an increasing number of men - publicly supporting the lifting of the ban. Some 17,000 people have so far signed a petition calling either for change or a clear explanation of why it should remain in force. </body>

      <description>Political leaders express optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accept a survival plan.</description>

      <body>Political leaders have expressed optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accepted a survival plan put forward by management. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael spoke to plant owners Ineos on Thursday afternoon. Unite had earlier agreed to "embrace" the firm's proposals "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs on Wednesday. Workers had previously rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Meanwhile, Ineos said the number of contractors who have been laid off at the Grangemouth complex, since the dispute started last week, had reached 2,000. Workers from Doosan Babcock leaving the plant said that more than 100 of them had just been told that there was no more work. Other companies are understood to have given a similar message to staff in the past 24 hours. Several of those affected blamed Ineos staff for holding out against changes to pay and pensions. Earlier, UK and Scottish governments representatives had expressed optimism over the future of the petrochemical and refinery at Grangemouth. After meeting with Ineos, Mr Carmichael said: "We are in a much better place today in relation to the future of the plant than we were yesterday. "There remains, of course, a great deal to be done." Finance Secretary John Swinney commented: "Behind us is a plant of over 1,000 high quality jobs in refining and petrochemicals, these are very skilled high quality jobs and the Scottish economy and UK economy requires that economic impact. "This plant has got a great future, everybody accepts that Grangemouth has got a great future. "What we need to do is resolve these outstanding issues, get the investment plan implemented and take forward and improve the prospects for the people that work in this plant." Ineos has said it plans to make an official statement on the Grangemouth issue on Friday. The BBC understands that some kind of agreement is being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. Local MP Michael Connarty said he believed the union would be making no challenges to the survival plan and would be accepting it in full. He added: "As far as I understand the company are away to draft it into a legal document which the convenor will sign on behalf of the shop stewards committee, and that will then be binding on the workforce in the plant." Unite earlier said it had made a number of recommendations to Ineos at its meeting on Thursday morning. General secretary Len McCluskey said: "This plant is on cold shut down and each day that goes by makes it harder to start back up again, which is why the stewards made the offer to the company - so that we can get people back to work." He said the union would not let the plant close, adding Unite had been "encouraged" by similar comments from First Minister Alex Salmond. Mr McCluskey has told Ineos he wants to meet Mr Ratcliffe for face-to-face discussions, arguing it would be an opportunity for him to "clarify" Unite's position and for Mr Ratcliffe to raise the assurances he was seeking. Mr McCluskey added: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during a visit to Yorkshire, said he remained hopeful a resolution to the dispute could be reached. He added: "This is an important business for Scotland, it's a very important industry for the whole of the United Kingdom. "We want to see those jobs saved, we want to see this business thrive, and I'm hopeful that agreements will be reached." Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had discussed the crisis with Unite and believed the union "fully understands the gravity of the situation". "They want to represent their members, and rightly so, and they're concerned about their members' jobs and livelihoods," he added. Before the talks with Unite, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that £300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" David Watt, from the Institute of Directors, said it was "quite sad" that the dispute at Grangemouth had reached this point. He commented: "It's rather gloomy in the way this has developed. I would have hoped both parties could have negotiated over a longer period. "I think there are opportunities but it's quite sad that we've got to this point. "There are probably faults by both sides." And he said he was surprised that the union thought the closure announcement was a shock. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Bomb ex-mayor jailed for 18 years</title>
      <description>A former mayor is sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in a town which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield".</description>

      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <body>Ford has raised its profit forecast for the year amid continued strength in its home market. Previously the company said that profits this year would match last year's, but Ford now expects to exceed the $8bn made in 2012. Third quarter profit fell 22% to $1.27bn (£780m), but that included a $250m charge to reorganise its business in Europe. Ford's North American unit reported a profit of $2.3bn for the third quarter. In a statement with the results, Bob Shanks, chief financial officer, said: "We substantially reduced our losses in Europe, set a record third quarter profit in Asia Pacific Africa and saw a $150m improvement in South America." Losses in Europe narrowed to $228m in the third quarter, an improvement on the same quarter in 2012 when it lost $470m. According to Mr Shanks, car sales in Europe will see "very, very modest growth" in the near term. Overall sales in the third quarter rose 12% to $36bn. Ford's business in North America has been helped by strong sales of its very profitable pick-up trucks. Ford has been selling more than 60,000 of its F-series truck every month for the past five months, around a 10% improvement on 2012. Ian Henry, director at AutoAnalysis, said: "At the moment it is quite unusual for a volume car manufacturer to upgrade [its profit forecast]." In a difficult economic climate, consumers tended to either opt for "better-value brands", such as Hyundai or Dacia, or spend the extra cash on premium brands, he said. Mr Henry said this meant "volume car" manufacturers, such as Ford, Fiat, or Vauxhall, were typically not so popular. "Ford must be pretty confident," he added. Speculation has surrounded Ford's chief executive Alan Mulally, who has reportedly been talking to Microsoft about a possible move to replace outgoing chief executive Steve Ballmer. But when asked about the matter at Ford's press conference, Mr Mulally said: "We don't comment on the speculation." Mr Mulally said the company's plan to keep him as chief executive until the end of 2014 was unchanged. He has been running the auto maker since 2006 and is the third-longest serving chief executive in Ford's history, after Henry Ford I and Henry Ford II. He has received praise for helping Ford to avoid the government bailouts needed by its competitors General Motors and Chrysler in 2009. </body>

      <body>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday which is seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. The petition was filed on the grounds that the organisers have allegedly not paid taxes for a previous event. However, race organisers say the race will still go ahead. Indian motorsports chief Vicky Chandhok said: "The race will go on. There's absolutely no doubt about that. This has happened many times before." Chandhok, who heads the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, added: "You've had people trying to stop cricket matches - our justice system is pretty strong that no sporting event should be stopped. "It's a civil matter. Let it be heard in court as long as it takes and that's it. No worries." A spokesman for the circuit's owner, Jaypee Sports International Limited, said: "Whatever the court says, we are ready to follow." Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 90 points with 100 still available, could clinch his fourth title in India this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will triumph if he finishes fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The Supreme Court in India has executive powers and ordered circuit bosses two years ago to freeze 25% of ticket revenues until they had settled an outstanding tax dispute. That ruling followed Public Interest Litigation filed by campaigner Amit Kumar, the same man who is behind Thursday's petition. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is already uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <body>Tottenham Hotspur moved a step closer to the Europa League knockout stages with a hard-earned victory away to Sheriff Tiraspol in Moldova. Jan Vertonghen's header from Christian Eriksen's cross set Spurs on their way. Vlad Chiriches produced a superb clearance to deny Henrique Luvannor an equaliser before Aaron Lennon hit a post on his first start for two months. Jermain Defoe's deflected shot doubled the lead as Spurs made it three wins in three games in Group K. The England international's 75th-minute strike moved him level with Martin Chivers's club record of 22 European goals. Having disposed of Norway's Tromso and Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala without conceding a goal, Spurs knew a third group victory would confirm their place in the last 32 - if Anzhi's home clash with Tromso ended level. It did not, but Anzhi's 1-0 win means Tottenham will reach the knockout stages if they defeat Sheriff at White Hart Lane on 7 November. Villas-Boas will hope it is a more comfortable experience than the one he endured at the Sheriff Stadium. The champions of Moldova have not won a group game in Europe for three years and must have feared the worst when Vertonghen beat captain Miral Samardzic in the air to power Eriksen's 12th-minute cross home, the Belgian's first goal since March. Yet Vertonghen spent the rest of the half at the other end of the pitch as Sheriff put the Spurs defence under intense pressure. The hosts would have been level in the 15th minute but for a superb piece of defending by Chiriches, the Romania international denying Luvannor an equaliser after the Brazilian rounded Hugo Lloris and rolled the ball towards an empty net. Cadu, another Brazilian, had a goal ruled out for offside, Ismail Isa flashed the ball across the face of goal and Luvannor fired over the bar as the home side continued to press. And there were anxious faces on the Spurs bench when Isa went down in the penalty area under a challenge from Sandro. But Tottenham survived on a night when the result outweighed the performance - and it might have been more comfortable for Villas-Boas had Lennon marked his first start since the opening weekend of the season with a goal, twice going close to doubling Spurs' lead. Defoe's goal confirmed the victory, though, and the Londoners reach the midway point of the group stage with a 100% record and yet to concede a goal. </body>

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been fined £8,000 by the Football Association for "improper conduct" during his side's Premier League match against Cardiff on Saturday. Mourinho, 50, was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting during the 4-1 win. He did not appeal and can be in the Stamford Bridge dugout on Sunday. "I accept the fine and against Manchester City I can work," he said. "What the referee wrote is true. I wasn't aggressive, I wasn't offensive, I just had a disagreement." Mourinho had until 18:00 BST on Thursday to contest the charge, but indicated after Chelsea's impressive 3-0 away win against Schalke in the Champions League on Tuesday that he would accept his punishment. "[Referee Taylor] is honest and fair [in the report]," added the Chelsea boss. "What he writes is exactly what happened and exactly why I didn't understand why I went to the stands. And it's exactly why the punishment is just a fine." Mourinho was last ordered to the stands in May when he was Real Madrid manager. He protested after a decision went against his team in the Copa del Rey final defeat by city rivals Atletico. </body>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died of a heart attack at the age of 89, his family has confirmed. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years". Among his many prizes was 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture for his piece Promenade. Awarded by the Royal Academy of Arts, the £10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. He told The Independent: "It's what I like doing. Old age is a shock, but I still enjoy making the works." "I look forward to going into the studio. I would be bored if I didn't do that." Sir Anthony played a pivotal role in the development of 20th Century sculpture, after first coming to public attention with a show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963. There, he exhibited large abstract sculptures, such as Early One Morning (1962), which were brightly painted and stood directly on the ground to engage the spectator on a one-to-one basis. It was a radical departure from the way sculpture had been seen in the past and paved the way for future developments in three-dimensional art. "I did break something open at the beginning," Sir Anthony said in June. "A tremendous lot of possibilities opened up to me when that happened, and I've been exploring these different areas for the rest of my life." The artist added: "Sculpture did have some assumptions and some, well, rules almost and I broke those rules." He was born in Surrey in 1924 and studied engineering at Christ's College Cambridge, before going on to specialise in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London until 1952. Sir Anthony then went on to influence others as a teacher at St Martin's School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981. There he inspired a younger generation of British sculptors including Phillip King, Tony Cragg, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. In the early 1950s he had started his own sculpting career by making rugged bronze animal and human figures, which were said to be concerned with "what it is like to be inside the body". His more famous later work, which questioned assumptions about form, material and subject matter in sculpture, can currently be seen in a major exhibition at The Museo Correr in Venice until 27 October. In a statement following his death, Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of 90, was still evident in the most recent work". Sir Anthony was also awarded the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997. He was knighted in 1987 and received the Order of Merit in May 2000, which recognises great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science, and he was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain in 2005. With Norman Foster and Tony Fitzpatrick he co-designed London's landmark Millennium Bridge, but the £18.2m project had to be closed down three days after it was opened in June 2000, as it swayed "alarmingly". Engineers blamed the "synchronised footfall" effect of hundreds of people stepping in unison and it was reopened nearly two years in February 2002, after £5m of modifications. Sir Anthony was married to painter Sheila Girling, with whom he had two sons and three grandchildren. He had a close relationship with the Royal Academy of Arts throughout his career and chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith has paid tribute to the late Royal Academician. "Sir Anthony Caro OM CBE RA was one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century," said Saumarez Smith. "He was elected as a Senior Member of the Royal Academy on 9 March 2004 and will be much missed by the RA as well as his friends and admirers internationally." </body>

      <body>A prominent Australian artist who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs has won a major national art prize. Nigel Milsom was awarded the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, winning $150,000, for his portrait Uncle Paddy. He pleaded guilty to robbing a 7-11 store in Sydney in April 2012. He later apologised to police, saying he thought he was "buying doughnuts". Milsom, a former security guard, is serving six years for armed robbery. The artist, who suffers from depression, completed the painting earlier this year while on bail awaiting sentencing for the crime. The winning portrait was picked by 2009 Moran Prize winner Ben Quilty and ex-Art Gallery of South Australia director Daniel Thomas, who were not told the names of the artists. "The fact is it was the best painting," Quilty told the Australian newspaper. "I judged the painting, not him." "Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good," said judge Daniel Thomas . "So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money." He praised Milsom's "extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate". Uncle Paddy depicts one of Milsom's grandfather's oldest friends; Thomas called it "a very old-fashioned Australian face". "There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too," said Milsom. "When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom." The Moran Prize, which annually awards contemporary Australian portraiture, is now in its 25th year. All the winning pictures become part of the Moran Arts Foundation Collection. Last year Milsom won the $30,000 art prize for the 2012 Sulman Prize. Weeks later, armed with a knife, axe and a fake gun, he and another man threatened to kill a shopkeeper while holding him hostage in the store room of a 7-11 store, reported the Telegraph. "My state of mind is hard to describe ... I thought I was buying doughnuts,'" he told the court earlier this year. "It felt like I was watching something as a movie that wasn't really happening." At the time of the crime, the court heard the artist had recently lost his mentor, art curator Nick Waterlow, and his sister, and was high on a combination of heroin, crystal meth, prescription drugs and alcohol. </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>
      <description>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked".</description>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run up to the attack on Pearl Harbour. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 67 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <description>Sexual assault victims face long wait for justice in Egypt</description>

      <body>Sexual violence in Egypt has reached epidemic proportions, according to human rights campaigners, but there is little hope of justice for the victims. For Hania Moheeb there was only one place to be on 25 January this year. It was the second anniversary of Egypt's revolution, and she headed for its birthplace - Tahrir Square. "I was yearning to see Tahrir that day," she says. "I decided to go by myself because I just couldn't stay away." But when the 43-year-old freelance journalist reached the area, the atmosphere troubled her. "Something was wrong. There were negative vibes in the air. I decided to leave the square." Ms Moheeb did not get the chance. "All of a sudden I found myself inside a very, very huge circle of men who were attacking every inch of my body," she says in a voice that is soft but unflinching. "They stripped me - their hands were all over my body, violating my intimate parts. I thought I was going to die because they were very aggressive. At a certain point I think I fainted because one of them was trying to strangle me with a scarf that was around my neck." Several of her attackers followed her all the way into an ambulance, where they carried on assaulting her. The brutal attack - which lasted more than half an hour - followed a similar pattern to others in the square. Ms Moheeb was surrounded by a mass of men, several layers deep. They shouted loudly to passers-by that they were helping her when they were actually molesting her. Sexual violence has long been a problem in Egypt, but mob assaults have increased dramatically since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The epidemic of sexual violence is the dark side of the revolution. A recent United Nations study suggested that nine out of 10 Egyptian women had experienced some form of sexual harassment. Human rights campaigners describe current levels of sexual violence as "horrifying". Most of the worst attacks have taken place during protests in Tahrir Square. Both human rights campaigners and victims like Ms Moheeb say sexual violence is a tool to silence women demonstrators. "It's not a coincidence that the attacks happen at times of political tension," says Nicholas Piachaud of Amnesty International. "The attacks seem aimed at stopping women coming onto the streets to protest." Though she was deeply traumatised by the attack, Ms Moheeb has raised her voice, not lowered it. She has spoken out publicly about her attack, still a rare move in this conservative country. Ms Moheeb says the wave of attacks has been fuelled by a culture of impunity. "Impunity is the number one encouragement for those molesters," she adds. "They can get away with it no matter how extreme they become." Those who carry out sexual assaults may feel encouraged by ultra conservative clerics like Saad Arafat. The white-bearded cleric maintains that women who complain about harassment are bringing it on themselves. "I say to the women you are the cause and reason for this," he said in a TV broadcast. "But I say you might have gone out unnecessarily, and therefore Allah set this wolfish devil upon you." The TV channel which aired him comments now been shut down, but plenty here are ready to blame the victim, as Janet Abdel Aleem discovered at a police station. The 35-year-old media researcher is a campaigner against sexual violence. She is also a victim. She was brutally assaulted on two separate occasions in Tahrir Square last November. The second attack was so brutal she had a miscarriage. Ms Abdel Aleem tried to report the initial attack to the police, but was victimised again. "When I went into the station I was wearing a badge saying: 'No to Harassment.' The officer's response was that the attacker might have read it without the word 'no', as if I was inviting people to harass me. "I insisted on filing a complaint though the officers were begging me to forgive the attacker as if he was one of their relatives." Small wonder perhaps that many victims do not even try to report sexual assaults to the authorities. The police have now set up a new unit to tackle violence against women. But victims fear it is a token gesture, with next to no prosecutions taking place. (An appeal court has just reduced the sentence of a man convicted of serial sexual harassment in 2009 from 45 years to five years, according to a local media report.) Hania Moheeb and Janet Abdel Aleem are among a group of women trying to bring a joint legal case about their assaults. Asked how long she might wait for justice in Egypt, Ms Moheeb has a quick response: "Decades." Some here are meting out their own form of vigilante justice. A group called Harass the Harassers patrols the streets during busy holiday periods, on the look-out for attackers. When they find one, they brand him with spray paint. We set off with some volunteers from the group - young men wearing high-visibility jackets, and carrying tasers. They are filling a vacuum left by the police, according to Mohammed al-Zeiny, one of their leaders. "There were girls being sexually harassed in the streets," he says. "No-one did anything to stop this - neither the police not the state, they don't care about this. The idea of seeing a girl being harassed in the street, and doing nothing is not manly." The powerfully built engineering student is not afraid of using his size. When his group swarmed around an alleged attacker he muscled in - restraining him in a headlock. The suspect - already being beaten by a bystander - tried to wriggle free. But Mohammed held firm, while his colleagues spray-painted the man's back. Guilty or innocent he was publicity humiliated. "I am a harasser" was stencilled across his shirt. </body>

      <description>Garment factory survivors struggling six months on</description>

      <body>After the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka six months ago, dozens of workers ended up with amputations or serious spinal injuries, and need long-term care. Most survivors of the disaster, in which 1,130 people died, are still waiting for financial help. Some families are still in agonising limbo, with their loved ones still recorded as missing. Musamat Rebecca Khatun was a sewing operator, and lost one leg below the knee, and the other just above the ankle when she was trapped in the rubble. She has gone through eight operations in six months, and is awaiting yet another one. "During the recent Eid festival, most of the doctors went home to visit their families," she says. "Afterwards, they came back and they saw that one of my legs had developed gangrene, and so they cut it again." At the moment, the doctors say she cannot be fitted with an artificial limb because of the infection. She remains in hospital. Ayesha Akhtar, 19, worked as a machine operator for New Wave Styles Ltd, one of the many businesses housed in the Rana Plaza complex. When the building crumpled on that fateful day, she was rescued by the evening. She is now out of hospital, but for her, life has changed forever. Whenever she sees a high-rise building, she is scared. "I know that buildings do not collapse like Rana Plaza every day, but I am still afraid." Ayesha says she is not going back to garment work. "I am forced to find work to take care of my family, but they do not want me to go back to garment workings. So I am looking for a new job." And six months on, she is still looking. According to one charity, Action Aid Bangladesh, some 1,400 people who had jobs in the Rana Plaza are still looking for work. Just a few minutes away from the site of the collapsed Rana Plaza building, there is a medical clinic. This is where Sraban Ahmed Jehangir now works. He used to have a good job in the complex, but now works as a clerk in the clinic for half the wage. "I used to get 8,000 Bangladeshi Taka [$103] per month - now I only get 3,000 Taka. "Since my house rental is 3,000 Taka, you can work out for yourself what my situation is like," he says. The day before speaking to us, he says he sold his mobile phone to pay for his latest rent instalment. Nazma Akhter is a garment worker who survived the Rana Plaza collapse, but her husband didn't. She has just had baby, adding to her burden. "Our future is totally bleak," she says. She lives in a small house near the Rana Plaza. She was given 20,000 Taka to take care of the funeral, and got 6,000 as back payment for loss of salary. She is getting medical support from an NGO. But she has no idea whether the money she has received so far can be classified as compensation. She does not know if she will get compensation or if she does, how much. The factory owners have not said anything, she says. Some financial aid was paid out by the government after the disaster, and some foreign companies are looking at arrangements for paying longer-term compensation. But discussions continue between the government, the unions, the factory owners and the foreign buyers about how much compensation and who should contribute what.

      <body>South Africans have applauded tough new measures announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to curb government spending on alcohol and air travel, as well as the alleged abuse of credit cards, in an attempt to cut costs. The move came as the African National Congress (ANC) government, in power since white-minority rule ended in 1994, tries to improve its image ahead of next year's election. Though the party is almost certain to be re-elected, its 66% majority is likely to fall amid allegations of failing to do enough to improve the lives of poor people, widespread corruption and abuse of taxpayers' money. South Africans have been overwhelmed with media reports of free spending and high-rolling ministers over the years. One recent example is Northern Cape's new provincial government premier Sylvia Lucas who came in for strong criticism for spending around $5,000 (£3,000) on fast food purchases on a government credit card during her first 10 weeks in office. In his last cabinet reshuffle, President Jacob Zuma fired Communications Minister Dina Pule following allegations that she had allowed her boyfriend to travel with her at the state's expense. Some government ministers have also been embroiled in allegations of rigging tenders in favour of friends. Others have been accused of indulging themselves with cars costing more than $100,000, expensive tastes in wine and five-star accommodation and travel around the world. Delivering his Medium Term Budget Policy Speech in parliament on Wednesday, Mr Gordhan read the riot act to big-spending ministers and public officials. He trimmed the fat on travel perks, blew the bubbles out of excessive alcohol and banned the use of credit cards. From 1 December, no alcohol will be served at government functions and spending on an event should not exceed $200, he said. Also, government ministers and officials will have to fly economy class - no more first or business class - and in fewer numbers and frequency, Mr Gordhan said. The main parliamentary opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), said it welcomed the austerity measures against wasteful spending, but said this should have long been the norm. Pieter Mulder, the leader of the small opposition Freedom Front Plus party, agreed. "There's not enough money any more. Now he [Gordhan] comes with all these government discipline measures, which I really think should have been done 20 years ago," he is quoting as saying. Nevertheless, the speech was typical Gordhan, decisive and engaging. He spoke of strong revenue collection, savings of about $80m from under-spending ministries, and a lower than forecast budget deficit of 4.2% which helped allay market fears and bolster sentiment among credit rating agencies. Annabel Bishop, an economist at private firm Investec, said she expected the budget to satisfy the capital markets and impress ratings agencies. "We believe... [the] budget outcome is not likely, in isolation, to prompt any of the rating agencies to downgrade SA's rating," she said. But there were some sad reflections on the year to date. Industrial action in the last year and, in particular a long drawn out two-month strike in the automotive sector, exerted a heavy toll on the economy. Projected GDP growth fell from 2.7% to an anaemic 2.1%. Opposition Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi believes the announcements were nothing more than smoke and mirrors for the benefit of investor confidence. "I think he did just enough to get the credit rating agencies off our back. I think he's sending a very strong signal with regard to cutting ministers' expenses. It's small money in the overall budget but it's sending a strong message," he said. DA spokesman Tim Harris said the mini budget was not nearly bold enough in tackling serious economic problems - or what the treasury calls "labour disputes, electricity shortages and other supply-side disruptions" in Africa's biggest economy. Nevertheless, the hope among many South Africans is that Mr Gordhan has guaranteed economic stability and boosted confidence in South Africa's future. </body>

      <description>The Japanese men who prefer virtual girlfriends to sex</description>

      <body>Unless something happens to boost Japan's birth rate, its population will shrink by a third between now and 2060. One reason for the lack of babies is the emergence of a new breed of Japanese men, the otaku, who love manga, anime and computers - and sometimes show little interest in sex. Tokyo is the world's largest metropolis and home to more than 35 million people, so on the face of it, it is hard to believe there is any kind of population problem at all. But Akihabara, an area of the city dedicated to the manga and anime subculture provides one clue to the country's problems. Akihabara is heaven for otaku. They are a generation of geeks who have grown up through 20 years of economic stagnation and have chosen to tune out and immerse themselves in their own fantasy worlds. Kunio Kitamara, of the Japan Family Planning Association, describes many young Japanese men as "herbivores" - passive and lacking carnal desire. It seems they no longer have the ambition of the post-war alpha males who made Japan such an economic powerhouse and no interest in joining a company and becoming a salary man. They have taken on a mole-like existence and, worryingly, withdrawn from relationships with the opposite sex. A survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2010 found 36% of Japanese males aged 16 to 19 had no interest in sex - a figure that had doubled in the space of two years. I met two otaku, who believe themselves to be in relationships with virtual girlfriends. This girlfriend is actually a Nintendo computer game called Love Plus, which comes as a small portable tablet. Nurikan and Yuge take their girlfriends, Rinko and Ne-ne, on actual dates to the park, and buy them cakes to celebrate their birthdays. "It's the kind of relationship we wish we'd had at high school," says Nurikan. In the game he is a 15-year-old, though in reality he is 38. "As long as I have time, I'll continue the relationship forever," says Yuge, who is 39. "As she's at high school, she picks me up in the morning and we go to school together. After school we meet at the gates and go home together... In the game I am 17." Yuge says he often puts Ne-ne - or the games console containing her - into the basket of his bicycle, then he takes photographs of them at his destination. Though Yuge would like to meet a real woman, and Nurikan is married, they say this is easier than having a real girlfriend. "At high school you can have relationships without having to think about marriage," says Yuge. "With real girlfriends you have to consider marriage. So I think twice about going out with a 3D woman." Nurikan says he keeps Rinko a secret from his wife, and hopes he never has to choose between them. It's hard to avoid feeling that otaku are in a perpetual state of childhood and are quite comfortable with their lives this way. Exactly why they have retreated into fantasy land is not obvious. Tokyo-based social commentator Roland Kelts says many young Japanese men are pessimistic about the future. They don't believe they will match their parents' wealth and don't want to commit themselves to relationships. "If you compare China or Vietnam, most of those kids on scooters going to nightclubs, and dancing their heart away and perhaps having sex - they know it's getting better, they know they are probably going to rock their parents' income," he says. "No-one in Japan feels that way." Several surveys have shown that even when Japanese men and women are in relationships, they have very little sex. In one survey just 27% said they had sex every week. Marriage rates are also plunging, and very few babies - only 2% - are born out of wedlock. Japan's demographic timebomb is also linked to the lack of immigration. In Britain one in eight people were born abroad, compared to one in 60 in Japan. But immigration in Japan is still heavily restricted, despite a dearth of some qualified workers. In Britain there are 60,000 healthcare workers from overseas, while in Japan - where there is a serious shortage of nurses - there are only 60. Japan has managed to preserve its unique culture in an increasingly globalised world but could that very sense of identity stand in the way of solving its population problems? Or is it just time for Japanese men to grow up, have more sex and make more babies? Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>'Halal' sex shop opens in Turkey</title>
      <description>Turkish online 'Halal' sex shop opens</description>

      <body>The front page of the Helal Sex Shop website is designed not to give fright. It features separate, generic silhouettes of a man and a woman in a headscarf. Browsers are directed to different pages for men and women. They are offered a range of condoms, massage oils, sprays, and scents. "Despite what outsiders may believe, sexuality is a normal human necessity in Islam," says the site's founder, 38-year-old Haluk Demirel. "But people, especially women, don't feel comfortable buying products from pornographic looking web sites. Or they don't like to go into to Western-style sex shops. So my online shop serves as a comfortable area, where they can easily find something to cater for their natural needs." Mr Demirel describes his business as the first online sex shop in the Muslim world to operate in line with Islamic teaching - the world's first Halal sex shop is, reportedly, in the Netherlands - a regular home for sexual innovation. He does not have a formal Halal certificate ("Halal", or "Helal" in Turkish, means permissible under Islamic law), so carries out his own unofficial checks to make sure that the products he sells are allowed in Islam. "In Islam, masturbation is forbidden therefore I don't sell vibrators, dolls or other similar toys for self pleasure," he says. In particular, Mr Demirel hopes to attract to his site women who may be put off by the more direct language of traditional sex websites. So far, around 45% of his customers are female. "We use words which are delicate, not pornographic," he explains. "For example, instead of 'horny' we use 'desiring'. These details are important." In Turkey, public discussion of sex is still a delicate subject. Some politicians prefer to avoid the subject altogether. During a recent visit to a new Ankara shopping centre, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan faced the potential indignity of walking past a Victoria's Secret shop, a chain most famous for its lingerie. Quietly, the owners of the shop pulled down their shutters before the prime minister walked by - avoiding the possibility of mutual embarrassment. Here in Istanbul, in neighbourhoods unlikely to be disturbed by prime-ministerial walkabouts, several dozen sex shops operate. None claims to operate in the name of religion. "People come freely to shop here," says one owner, who preferred not to give his name. Does he worry about his customers leaving him for Helal Sex Shop? "I haven't checked their website," he answers dismissively. But many others have. Some accuse the website of taking advantage of a trend for Islamic-approved products. "They invented 'Islamic fashion'," writes one Turkey's most-read newspaper columnist, Ahmet Hakan, "Then 'Islamic hotels' and 'Islamic holidays'. Now, finally, they've moved into sexual products." On social media in Turkey, Helal Sex Shop is the subject of intense, occasionally mocking and graphic debate - much of it unrepeatable here. "Let your Helal shop be for the best... :) The only thing you have not exploited for religion was lubricant," writes one critic on Twitter. "It's a website that helps people who are having sex with their spouses," posts another commentator. "Instead of being criticised it deserves to be appreciated." The debate has helped to spread the word. Helal Sex Shop now gets around 50,000 clicks a day. The interest has taken Haluk Demirel by surprise. Under the weight of users, his site has now crashed. </body>

      <title>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</title>
      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24463736</url>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>The political prisoners who Burma will not free</title>
      <description>The inmates Burma will not or cannot free</description>

      <body>The military hat still hangs proudly on the wall of Major Win Naing Kyaw's house, on a peg just beneath what is clearly a favourite picture. The major, in sunglasses, stands stiffly, staring out sternly; next to him is his wife, Khin Moe San, with an infectiously radiant smile. Smiles are now in very short supply. Khin Moe San has just been to visit her husband in prison. "He's not well", she says, shaking her head, before telling me he's been "sad and depressed" since President Barack Obama visited Burma (also known as Myanmar) last year. High-level foreign visits are often accompanied by prisoner releases and this trip was no different. Of the 10 political prisoners serving life in the major's block in prison, nine were allowed to go free. Only he was left behind. "The government clearly hates him," Khin Moe San told me sadly. The major certainly has powerful enemies. Four years ago, he was arrested at Rangoon (also known as Yangon) airport. After spending weeks in jail, he confessed to leaking sensitive details of Burma's military ties with North Korea to journalists. Under a law more than 60 years old, he was sentenced to death for revealing state secrets. As is now common in Burma, the sentence was then commuted to life imprisonment. Khin Moe San tells me her husband's confession was forced, made after he had been deprived of food, water and sleep, and his family had been threatened. Whatever the truth, the major is considered by many to be a political prisoner. Earlier this year Burma's president set up a special committee to identify political prisoners and submit recommendations to the government as to who should go free. But those like the major, who are put on the list, are not necessarily freed. For all the talk of democracy, it's not hard to guess who's blocking his release - the Burmese army is still hugely powerful. Not many of the 133 names still on the latest list of political prisoners are straightforward. Often, the issue is about what exactly makes a prisoner "political". Some human rights groups are unhappy that those who have taken part in violence are included. What if someone has been party to the most brutal of atrocities - should they be ruled out? In a dingy room on the outskirts of Rangoon, I met up with one of the daughters of a student leader called U Sein. She showed me the only picture the family have of their father - a fresh-faced man from another era. In the 1970s and 80s, U Sein worked as part of the resistance against the dictatorship and then joined a rebel group called the All Burma Students' Democratic Front. On the frontline in the northern mountains, relations between the young fighters soured. U Sein was among a group accused of being government spies. Fifteen were executed outright. The rest were buried up to their waists in the ground - beaten and left exposed to the elements for more than a week. Having dreamed of bringing democracy to Burma, U Sein and 19 others ended up being tortured to death by their own side. One of the men leading the students' interrogation and torture in the mountains was called Than Gyoung. He is now in jail. But much to the horror of the tortured students' families, he may not be there much longer. Activists consider Than Gyoung to be a political prisoner - his name has been put forward by the committee for release. Bo Kyi, himself a former political prisoner, said he considers all of the students, including Than Gyoung, to be victims of the system at the time - the products of a brutal military dictatorship, and the suspicion and paranoia it created. Bo Kyi wants Than Gyoung released and then a meeting held with the families of the students, so that the killer can explain his actions and they can, he hopes, be reconciled. If it happened, it would be an isolated example of Burma delving into its traumatic recent past. The tentative democratic changes that have taken placed here in the last three years have been made possible by looking to the future, to avoid upsetting the army and its vested interests. All are acutely aware that scratching too deep or looking too closely at recent history could threaten Burma's still-fragile reforms.

      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>Ofcom reveals state of UK broadband</title>
      <description>Ofcom's annual report reveals that while some UK roads are 3G notspots, superfast broadband is now available for the majority of homes.</description>

      <body>While superfast broadband is now available to almost three quarters of UK homes, getting a connection on Britain's roads is more tricky, according to a report from Ofcom. Its annual infrastructure report looked at mobile coverage on roads for the first time. While motorways have good 3G coverage, just 35% of the UK's A and B roads are served by all four mobile networks. The report found that 9% of roads have no 3G coverage at all. The latest trends in mobile and broadband outlined by the report are designed to give a snapshot of the UK's communications market. Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of superfast speeds, defined by the watchdog as 30Mbps (megabits per second) or above. That equates to 22% of connections, up from 10% last year. There are several reasons why consumers may be reluctant to upgrade, thinks Andrew Ferguson from broadband news site ThinkBroadband. "The usual factors we encounter from consumers are resistance to any increase in price, and the £10 to £20 premium for faster services can deter many, particularly if paying under £10 for their broadband service now," he said. "There are also a good number who after not getting speeds close to the advertised speeds previously are wary of upgrading for little or no benefit," he added. The appetite for data is huge though - Britons use 650 million gigabytes in an average month, equivalent to more than one billion copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to the report. Ofcom believes that there are two main factors contributing to this deluge of data - the fact that many households have lots of devices wanting to connect to the internet and the need for high-quality on-demand TV services. Outside the home, people are also demanding more connectivity. According to the report the number of public wi-fi hotspots in the UK has doubled from 16,000 to 34,000 over the last year. The amount of data being sent or received from these hotspots has almost trebled, to almost 2 million gigabytes a month. Meanwhile 4G services continue to be rolled out by the UK's mobile operators. As well as looking at coverage on the UK's roads, Ofcom is also looking at 3G services on railways although the results will not be released until next year. "We know consumers increasingly expect superfast speeds, but it is also important to make sure people can connect over a very wide area. That is why we are doing everything we can to support moves to improve coverage in difficult areas such as roads and train lines," said Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive. </body>

      <body>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors. Created by American scientists, the components exploit properties of carefully engineered silicon slices to hold and quickly deliver a charge. Renewable energy sources could also benefit from the work on the cheaper super-capacitors. The silicon components should be easy to add to existing chip-production systems, said the researchers. Super-capacitors built from carbon are already used as energy storage systems in electric vehicles and in wind turbines to ensure blades turn smoothly, but their bulk and cost have limited them to these niche applications. Scientists in the engineering department at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee tested different materials to see if they could be used to reduce the cost and size of these super-capacitors. Silicon became a good candidate when the Vanderbilt team found a way to apply a coat of graphene that was only a few nanometres thick. This coating was needed to stop the silicon reacting with the chemicals that provide the ions used to store an electrical charge. The team, headed by engineering professor Cary Pint, used porous silicon in their research because the method of etching billions of tiny pits on to the material is well established. All those nano-scale features give the material a huge surface area relative to its size and help it store a significant electrical charge. Writing in a paper in the journal Nature, the scientists explained how the coating bestowed on the silicon properties similar to those seen in commercial super-capacitors. It allows them to dispense their stored power quickly and last much longer than current re-chargeable batteries. The team is now looking into ways to integrate the coated silicon into existing manufacturing processes so the super-capacitors can be more widely used in gadgets such as phones. One of the first applications of the work could be as a storage system for solar power plants. Super-capacitors on the rear of solar cells could store power as it is collected and then dispense it during the night when demand grows. "All the things that define us in a modern environment require electricity," said Prof Pint. "The more that we can integrate power storage into existing materials and devices, the more compact and efficient they will become." </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <title>BT told to change 'misleading' TV ad</title>
      <description>A BT TV advert has been called "misleading" by the ASA over claims it made about what can interfere with wi-fi signals.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has told BT to change a TV advertisement, following complaints about claims it made about wi-fi interference. In the advert, BT said its new Home Hub could handle interference caused by gadgets that use the same radio spectrum as wi-fi. The ad showed gadgets such as mobile phones and radios, wrongly suggesting they could slow wi-fi speeds. BT said it would review its ad approval process in the wake of the ruling. The ASA said the advert was misleading because of the prominence it gave to devices, such as phones and radios, that did not interfere with wi-fi signals. In its judgement, the ASA acknowledged evidence cited by BT suggesting some non-wi-fi devices, such as baby monitors and video senders, could interfere with wi-fi but said these did not feature significantly enough in the advert. "We considered that the inclusion of images of mobile phones and radios implied that consumers who had those items in their homes may experience problems due to interference when we had not seen any evidence to that effect," it said. The ASA has told BT that the advert must not be broadcast in its current form. In an official statement , BT said the ASA had agreed that some household devices could interfere with wi-fi but conceded the watchdog's point that such devices had not featured enough in the advert. "We are reviewing our legal sign-off processes to ensure that creative visuals accurately reflect our substantiation in future TV ads," it added. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70652000/jpg/_70652651_fb.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>New top-level web domains announced</title>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: شبكة, the Arabic word for "web"; 游戏, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", онлайн and сайт. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <title>Teenagers' anti-sexting app launched</title>
      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <body>Ebay has announced it is to acquire start-up Shutl in a bid to bring one-hour delivery to the UK. The service will be offered when both seller and buyer are in the same area. The online auction site already has a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes, with Shutl, to add more than 20 other US cities next year. The UK service will start in London. Speedy delivery is seen as a key growth area for retailers, with rivals such as Amazon also rolling out new services. Its AmazonFresh offering, which is so far only available in Los Angeles or Seattle, sources products from grocery shops, restaurants and other local businesses - essentially acting as a enhanced courier service. Other start-ups such as San Francisco-based Instacart promise the same, although its approach is not to have any direct tie-up with retailers. "Today, approximately 75% of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home," said eBaymarketplaces president Devin Wenig in a statement announcing the Shutl acquisition. "Traditional retail isn't going away. But it is transforming, and that creates enormous opportunity within the $10 trillion total commerce market." No financial details of the deal were disclosed by either company. Shutl already operates in the UK, counting retailers such as Schuh, Warehouse and Argos among its clients. It allows customers to choose as-soon-as-possible delivery - its record is just under 14 minutes - or to select a one-hour window in which to receive the goods. Using rapid delivery comes at a cost - Shutl adds an extra £6.99 to some products if they are needed quickly. Founder and chief executive Tom Allason said that Shutl would continue to work with all its existing partners, but would expand to accommodate eBay's plans. "E-commerce is quick and convenient, two things that delivery is not," wrote Mr Allason. "Together with eBay, we believe that we can transform this market and fulfil our mission." </body>

      <title>Google Chrome adds parental controls</title>
      <description>Google's web browser, Chrome, introduces controls that allow parents to monitor their children's browsing history and block certain websites.</description>

      <body>Google has introduced controls to its Chrome web browser that allow parents to monitor and control the browsing behaviour of their children. The new feature, called "supervised users", allows "managers" to set up profiles of the people they want to monitor. Managers can view the supervised users' browsing history, block specific sites, and approve access requests. The feature is available on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. It is also available to Chromebook users. But Google says the default setting is to allow a newly created supervised user to view all websites - managers have to specify what sites they want to block. SafeSearch is activated automatically for supervised users, preventing most adult content from appearing in Google search results. The move comes after growing concerns over inappropriate content children can be exposed to online. Other browsers, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, offer content controls that can be set by an administrator. Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system enables users to set up a "Kid's Corner" section on the phone that only allows access to specified games, music, videos and apps. Kids are unable to access disallowed websites. A recent survey found that many youngsters aged nine to 11 were engaging in risky behaviour online, such as sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, including the 18-rated Call of Duty series. ISC2, an organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety, also found that 43% of youngsters went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours online every time they did so. Another survey, by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, found that 69% of teachers and 40% of young people thought online safety should be taught in more schools and included in the national curriculum. </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>
      <date>1382470481</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of computers already running any version of OS X released since 2009. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. Chromebook computers also get free upgrades for Google's PC operating system. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>

      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Critics dismiss new data legislation</title>
      <description>Major new European data-protection laws may have serious loopholes, say critics.</description>

      <body>Critics have said new European data-protection laws have loopholes that could render the legislation useless. The rules are the first attempt to create strong data-protection laws for Europe's 500 million citizens. They include a clause to strengthen online privacy in the wake of whistleblower Edward Snowden's allegations about US spying. They also set out ways citizens can erase their personal data - the so-called right to be forgotten. Lawmakers have toughened the initial draft regulation, prepared by the European Commission, to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty. This is a direct response to allegations from former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency (NSA) snooping on European citizens' data. Another clause seeks to limit user profiling, requiring companies to explain their use of personal data in detail to customers and to seek prior consent. To ensure that the regulation is properly applied, most businesses would have to designate or hire data-protection officers. After 18 months of fierce industry lobbying, the legislation was passed with a 49-3 committee vote, with one abstention. The European Parliament still needs to hold another vote and seek agreement with the EU's 28 member states though — which is likely to result in some changes. "Tonight's vote sends a clear signal - as of today, data protection is made in Europe," said EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding. But French consumer group La Quadrature du Net was disappointed with the draft law. "There are some big loopholes that could void the effectiveness of the whole legislation," said Jeremie Zimmermann, from the organisation. He said vague wording such as "legitimate interest" could allow businesses to "exonerate themselves from the legislation". "A business could say that it is a legitimate interest to collect data in order to provide a better service for consumers or to enable it to make money," he said. He was also surprised that the rules around data profiling were not tougher. "Machines that crunch data are used to make important decisions such as who can get a job, who can get a loan, who can get insurance," he said. "This legislation allows firms to continue to collect and process more data and profile individuals." Bridget Treacy, partner and head of UK privacy and cyber-security at law firm, Hunton and Williams thinks that companies will have to ring the changes in order to comply with the legislation. "It enhances consumer rights and means businesses are going to have to focus on making sure they know what data they've got and what they do with it," she said. "One of the requirements of the legislation is that companies only collect the minimum amount of data that they require for a specific purpose. Firms are going to have to be much clearer about what data they are collecting and why." "It means that they will not be able to hold on to data as a bit of a comfort blanket," she added. Companies that fail to comply with the new law could be subject to a fine of up to 5% of their annual turnover — which could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a few billion dollars for internet giants such as Google. Now begins a long process during which the approved legislation will be debated among between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. It is expected to be concluded in March. </body>

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <description>A White House official is sacked after being unmasked as the man who wrote an abrasive commentary on his colleagues on Twitter.</description>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Mac v PC - the battle resumes</title>
      <description>Apple and Microsoft renew their rivalry</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614331</url>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro dies</title>
      <description>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro, widely regarded as one of the greatest of his generation, dies at the age of 89.</description>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died of a heart attack at the age of 89, his family has confirmed. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years". Among his many prizes was 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture for his piece Promenade. Awarded by the Royal Academy of Arts, the £10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. He told The Independent: "It's what I like doing. Old age is a shock, but I still enjoy making the works." "I look forward to going into the studio. I would be bored if I didn't do that." Sir Anthony played a pivotal role in the development of 20th Century sculpture, after first coming to public attention with a show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963. There, he exhibited large abstract sculptures, such as Early One Morning (1962), which were brightly painted and stood directly on the ground to engage the spectator on a one-to-one basis. It was a radical departure from the way sculpture had been seen in the past and paved the way for future developments in three-dimensional art. "I did break something open at the beginning," Sir Anthony said in June. "A tremendous lot of possibilities opened up to me when that happened, and I've been exploring these different areas for the rest of my life." The artist added: "Sculpture did have some assumptions and some, well, rules almost and I broke those rules." He was born in Surrey in 1924 and studied engineering at Christ's College Cambridge, before going on to specialise in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London until 1952. Sir Anthony then went on to influence others as a teacher at St Martin's School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981. There he inspired a younger generation of British sculptors including Phillip King, Tony Cragg, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. In the early 1950s he had started his own sculpting career by making rugged bronze animal and human figures, which were said to be concerned with "what it is like to be inside the body". His more famous later work, which questioned assumptions about form, material and subject matter in sculpture, can currently be seen in a major exhibition at The Museo Correr in Venice until 27 October. In a statement following his death, Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of 90, was still evident in the most recent work". Sir Anthony was also awarded the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997. He was knighted in 1987 and received the Order of Merit in May 2000, which recognises great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science, and he was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain in 2005. With Norman Foster and Tony Fitzpatrick he co-designed London's landmark Millennium Bridge, but the £18.2m project had to be closed down three days after it was opened in June 2000, as it swayed "alarmingly". Engineers blamed the "synchronised footfall" effect of hundreds of people stepping in unison and it was reopened nearly two years in February 2002, after £5m of modifications. Sir Anthony was married to painter Sheila Girling, with whom he had two sons and three grandchildren. He had a close relationship with the Royal Academy of Arts throughout his career and chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith has paid tribute to the late Royal Academician. "Sir Anthony Caro OM CBE RA was one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century," said Saumarez Smith. "He was elected as a Senior Member of the Royal Academy on 9 March 2004 and will be much missed by the RA as well as his friends and admirers internationally." </body>

      <title>Jailed artist wins portrait prize</title>
      <description>Australian artist Nigel Milsom, who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs, has won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize</description>

      <body>A prominent Australian artist who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs has won a major national art prize. Nigel Milsom was awarded the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, winning $150,000, for his portrait Uncle Paddy. He pleaded guilty to robbing a 7-11 store in Sydney in April 2012. He later apologised to police, saying he thought he was "buying doughnuts". Milsom, a former security guard, is serving six years for armed robbery. The artist, who suffers from depression, completed the painting earlier this year while on bail awaiting sentencing for the crime. The winning portrait was picked by 2009 Moran Prize winner Ben Quilty and ex-Art Gallery of South Australia director Daniel Thomas, who were not told the names of the artists. "The fact is it was the best painting," Quilty told the Australian newspaper. "I judged the painting, not him." "Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good," said judge Daniel Thomas . "So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money." He praised Milsom's "extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate". Uncle Paddy depicts one of Milsom's grandfather's oldest friends; Thomas called it "a very old-fashioned Australian face". "There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too," said Milsom. "When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom." The Moran Prize, which annually awards contemporary Australian portraiture, is now in its 25th year. All the winning pictures become part of the Moran Arts Foundation Collection. Last year Milsom won the $30,000 art prize for the 2012 Sulman Prize. Weeks later, armed with a knife, axe and a fake gun, he and another man threatened to kill a shopkeeper while holding him hostage in the store room of a 7-11 store, reported the Telegraph. "My state of mind is hard to describe ... I thought I was buying doughnuts,'" he told the court earlier this year. "It felt like I was watching something as a movie that wasn't really happening." At the time of the crime, the court heard the artist had recently lost his mentor, art curator Nick Waterlow, and his sister, and was high on a combination of heroin, crystal meth, prescription drugs and alcohol. </body>

      <description>Comedian Alan Davies pays damages after retweeting a post linking Tory peer Lord McAlpine's name to a TV report on paedophilia, the High Court hears.</description>

      <body>Comedian Alan Davies has paid damages after he retweeted a post linking a Tory peer's name to a TV report on a "senior political figure who is a paedophile", the High Court has heard. Mr Davies apologised for the "great damage and distress" his post caused ex-Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord McAlpine, his lawyer said. He accepted the "allegations" were "completely untrue", his lawyer added. Lord McAlpine's solicitor said his client accepted Davies' apology. But speaking after the hearing at the London court, Andrew Reid added: "The fact remains that both he [Lord McAlpine] and his family have been caused immeasurable distress which cannot be rectified. "There still remain people influenced by this tweet and all the apologies in the world are not going to put the situation back to where it was." Mr Davies said he "stood by" the public apology he issued at the time and had made a donation of £13,000 to the NSPCC in an attempt to make amends. "I hoped those steps might avoid legal action but in March press reports appeared saying I was going to be sued for £200,000," he said in a statement issued after the hearing. "I offered to pay £15,000 in damages plus a contribution to costs and agreed to make today's statement in court. "From my own experience, I am able to warn others of the dangers of retweeting." During the hearing, which neither Lord McAlpine nor Mr Davies attended, lawyers for both outlined details of the libel action to the judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat. Sir Edward Garnier QC, for Lord McAlpine, said on 2 November last year the then "managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism" tweeted: "If all goes well we've got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile." Sir Edward said the prospect prompted further Twitter activity. Newsnight broadcast the report about the sexual abuse of boys at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wrexham, Clwyd, in the 1970s and 1980s, and accused an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years of sexually abusing boys in care". Sir Edward said that, prior to the broadcast, Mr Davies tweeted: "Any clues who this Tory paedophile is...?" He said a few minutes later Mr Davies received a reply which contained links to three websites, including to an article about an inquiry into abuse at the Bryn Estyn home and to a Swedish website which "purported to report on a paedophile ring in the British establishment". Sir Edward said the reply tweet then said "lord mcalpine, some would say". He added: "Most unfortunately, Mr Davies retweeted that tweet. At the time he had a substantial number of followers on Twitter - in excess of 400,000." Mr Davies' lawyer Steve Hudson told the judge: "Mr Davies withdraws the allegation made on Twitter unreservedly and apologises sincerely to Lord McAlpine for the great damage and distress his tweeting has caused him." He added: "Mr Davies hopes that as a result of this matter other Twitter users will be more aware of the potential damaging consequences of tweeting and be more careful in how they use that platform." On Tuesday, Lord McAlpine's libel action against Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, was formally settled at the same court. Mrs Bercow had already apologised and paid the peer undisclosed damages for a defamatory tweet linking Lord McAlpine to false claims of child sex abuse allegations. Meanwhile, Ofcom has upheld complaints over episodes of Newsnight and This Morning that led to the peer being wrongly implicated. Lord McAlpine was not named but the watchdog ruled that airing the claims while there was internet speculation about the alleged abuser's identity had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. </body>

      <body>The centenary of World War I is to be marked in a National Portrait Gallery show of paintings, films and sculptures inspired by the conflict. The Great War in Portraits will run at the central London gallery from 27 February until 15 June, 2014. The exhibition will include two films made about the Battle of the Somme from different sides of the lines. It will also feature portraits of Sir Winston Churchill and war poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Paintings and photographs of soldiers decorated for bravery will be shown alongside prisoners of war, the wounded and those shot at dawn for cowardice. Major loans on display will include expressionist artworks by Lovis Corinth and Max Beckmann and Ludwig Kirchner's Selbstbildnis als Soldat - Self-portrait as a Soldier. Also on show will be portraits of the generals who plotted the course of the war and a photograph of assassin Gavrilo Princip whose murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered the conflict. Other highlights will include Jacob Epstein's The Rock Drill, one of the great early modernist works related to the war, and a rare photograph by Jules Gervais Courtellemont depicting a battle-scarred, deserted landscape. The gallery will host a range of activities linked to the centenary including two special performances by the Portrait Choir inspired by the war. Exhibition curator Paul Moorhouse said: "The Great War in Portraits explores a complex range of human experience. "Evolving different roles, responsibilities and destinies, it illuminates the way war was represented through portraits of individuals - each caught up in events beyond reason or control." </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>
      <description>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked".</description>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run up to the attack on Pearl Harbour. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 67 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <body>Rebecca Stead has won this year's Guardian children's fiction prize for her novel Liar And Spy, about an 11-year-old boy who hides from reality by pretending to be a detective. She is the first US-based author to win, after changes to the rules. Stead's competition included The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, David Almond's The Boy Who Swam with Piranhas and Katherine Rundell's Rooftoppers. Judges said Liar And Spy, Stead's third novel, was "incredibly sensitive". "Its central characters are all children who have complexities in their lives which they are dealing with," said Julia Eccleshare, The Guardian's children's books editor and chair of the judges. "It's a novel about how children have to navigate the world. It is a quiet book, but although the drama is finely-tuned, the overall impact is powerful, moving and surprising," she said. All of Stead's novels are set in New York, where she grew up, and where Liar And Spy's main character Georges is nicknamed "Gorgeous" at school because of the silent "s" his parents have included in his name. His life gets steadily worse when he moves into a new apartment block as his dad loses his job and his mum has to work longer shifts. He then gets caught up in a spying game with another boy living in the block and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Lottie Longshanks, one of the winners of the Young Critics Competition 2013 - also announced on Wednesday night - told The Guardian it was "a very well written story, with lots of quirky characters and some important messages". Stead, whose second book When You Reach Me won the 2010 Newbery medal, is a former lawyer who turned to writing after the birth of her children. She told the newspaper she was inspired by the "tough time" she had negotiating her school years. "I felt vulnerable and very much between friends. This wasn't because I had some horrific bullying story, but because of a steady drip of negativity," said Stead. "I was thinking about how something so un-sensational, so un-dramatic, coloured my life so completely." The prize, which was founded in 1967, comes with a cheque for £1,500 and was opened up to writers who are not resident in the UK last year. It is awarded annually to fiction written for children aged eight and above, and is the only children's fiction award selected by fellow writers. The judging panel also included Andy Mulligan, winner of the 2011 Guardian children's fiction prize, Jason Wallace, author of Out of the Shadows, which won the Costa award in 2010, and Binny for Short writer Hilary McKay, who won the Guardian prize in 1992. </body>

      <body>BBC Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw has seen his audience figures slump by 300,000 over the last three months. The 29-year-old breakfast DJ now has one million fewer listeners than his predecessor Chris Moyles, according to the figures from research body Rajar. With 5.58m listeners a week, the breakfast show is suffering its lowest audience for a decade, easily beaten by the morning shows on Radios 2 and 4. Grimshaw took over from Moyles in 2012, in a bid to attract younger listeners. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: "After the biggest set of changes to Radio 1 for a generation, we're really happy that the breakfast show sounds fresher, younger and more vibrant than ever and as a result 833,000 of the show's 'over-30s' listeners have moved on to other stations." Chris Evans appears to be the main beneficiary, attracting 9.34 million weekly listeners, while Radio 4's flagship Today show draws 6.8 million listeners. Evans' figures were up 800,000 on the same period last year, re-affirming his status as the UK's most popular breakfast DJ. Grimshaw, by comparison, has lost 305,000 listeners in the three months to 24 October - with audiences falling by 17% on the same quarter in 2012. He now trails Evans by 3.8 million listeners, a dramatic change from four years ago, when the breakfast shows for the two stations were almost neck and neck. Radio 1's breakfast show is now close to its record lowest audience of 5.5 million, recorded by Sara Cox in the last three months of her tenure, in 2003. Radio 2 continues to have the UK's biggest audience with 14.9 million listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83 million listeners, marginally behind Radio 4's 10.87 million. "Radio 2 is a remarkable success story and continues to reach huge audiences whilst never failing to surprise and amaze with the diversity of its output," said Radio 2 controller Helen Boaden. Radio 3's total listener numbers rose 1.5% to just over 2 million, during a period that included its annual coverage of the Proms, while BBC 6 Music's listenership was up 6.9% year on year - despite a dip of 3.4% on the previous quarter. BBC Radio 5 Live grew its audience to 6.12 million, rising 0.5% year on year, while digital sister station Radio 5 Live Sports Extra attracted a record 1.52 million listeners following its coverage of England's Ashes victory this summer. BBC's Asian Network fell by 5% over the year, averaging 555,000 listeners each week. </body>

      <body>British actor Jamie Dornan is in talks to replace Charlie Hunnam in the forthcoming film adaptation of erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. Belfast-born Dornan, best known for his roles in BBC drama The Fall and US fantasy series Once Upon A Time, will play lead character Christian Grey. Dornan is understood to have screen-tested for the role before Hunnam was cast, reports Variety. He is expected to sign up for at least three films based on the book trilogy. Published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexually-charged relationship between billionaire Grey and college student Anastasia Steele, who will be played by Dakota Johnson - daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. The novel and its two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have become a literary phenomenon that earned author EL James a reported $95m (£61.5m) last year. There has been intense speculation over who will star in the film adaptation, which will be directed by another Briton, artist Sam Taylor-Johnson. Hunnam dropped out of the role earlier this month. Universal Pictures said his sudden departure was a mutual decision due to a scheduling problem with the actor's TV commitments. However, there have been reports that the Sons of Anarchy actor had been overwhelmed by the media attention. He was also reported to have been dissatisfied with Kelly Marcel's screen adaptation. Closer's Patrick Marber, who was Oscar-nominated for his Notes on a Scandal screenplay, is currently working on the screenplay, with Universal hoping to begin shooting next month. </body>

      <body>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man has caused controversy among some schools in Northern Ireland. The prestigious exhibition opened to the public in Londonderry on Wednesday morning, the first time it has been taken outside of England. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. David Shrigley's naked model has been avoided by a number of schools because it shows a man urinating into a bucket. Glasgow-based Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greeting cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Schools from across Northern Ireland have been invited to the exhibition. Ann Murray, the principal of Oakgrove Integrated Primary School in Derry, said: "This particular piece of art is too much for some students. "We have younger people at the school, so I'd rather have their parents take them to see Shrigley's piece rather than the school. "We talked about Shrigley's piece, but we avoided that particular gallery. "Some parents may find it really offensive." Jack Malvern, the arts correspondent with The Times newspaper, said: "I personally don't think it's offensive. "What we have here is teachers who are worried about parents' potential reactions rather than their actual reactions. "If one parent says no then the entire class is excluded. It's a shame. "There is nothing offensive about this, it's humorous. "When I was speaking to people in Derry they told me that you have to take into consideration local sensitivities. They said they are a more socially conservative society." Denis Feeney, vice principal of St John's Primary School in Derry, said: "We didn't go to the Shrigley piece because it just wasn't appropriate. "The Turner experience was fantastic all round, but we thought it was just a bit much." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. </body>

      <title>Sophia Loren wins 39-year tax feud</title>
      <description>An Italian court ruling has puts end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities.</description>

      <body>An Italian supreme court ruling has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities. The argument centred around Loren's earnings in 1974. She claimed tax was owed on 60% of her income, but the state said it should be 70%. The Court of Cassation ruled in her favour, saying the actress's earnings were covered by a 1982 tax amnesty. "A saga that has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over," said Loren. "I always look to the future and I leave bad experiences like this one behind me," she was quoted as saying by the La Stampa daily newspaper. Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: "The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case." Loren, who was born Sofia Scicolone and started her film career in 1950, famously spent 17 days in prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute - an incident that drew her fans to the jail near Naples. She said at the time that her tax specialist had erred, meaning her tax return understated her earnings by about 5 million lire (then $7,000). Entering the prison, she said she was being subjected to "an unjust situation due to a little mistake by a tax specialist". The actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary Grant in the 1958 film Houseboat. She won an Oscar for her heart-rending performance in 1961 film Two Women about a mother raped while protecting her daughter in war-torn Italy. In July, she was photographed on the set of a film version of Jean Cocteau's 1930 play La Voix Humaine - The Human Voice - which will be directed by her son Edoardo Ponti. </body>

      <body>The female head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) has been named the most powerful figure in the art world. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani came top of ArtReview magazine's annual Power 100 due to "her organisation's vast purchasing power". Sheikha Al-Mayassa first appeared on the Power 100 in 2011 at number 90, rising to number 11 in 2012. China's Ai Weiwei, who topped the countdown in 2011, is the highest-placed artist at number nine. Other familiar names in the top 10 include art dealer Larry Gagosian, ranked at four, and Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, placed at six. The latter was made a Companion of Honour by Prince Charles on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his services to art. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is the sister of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who assumed the role of Qatar's emir when his father abdicated in June. According to ArtReview, the QMA spends around $1bn a year (£618m) developing galleries, sponsoring film festivals and supporting public art. It also sponsored Tate Modern's Damien Hirst exhibition, which attracted more than 463,000 visitors during its run last year. Last year's Power 100 was also topped by a woman - Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the curator of the influential Documenta 13 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. David Zwirner, who owns galleries in London and New York, is in second place in this year's rundown, while his former business partner Iwan Wirth is ranked at three. Sir Nicholas comes just behind Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, the co-creators of the Serpentine galleries in London. Compiled by a 13-member international jury, the Power 100 is described as "a unique snapshot of the contemporary art scene". According to the contemporary art magazine, those included are "judged on their international influence over the production of art and contribution to the art world during the past 12 months". </body>

      <body>Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy will play Sir Elton John in a biopic of the singer's life called Rocketman, it has been announced. The 36-year-old British actor previously played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and has starred in films such as Inception, Lawless and Bronson. Rocketman is being made with the co-operation of Sir Elton, 66, who is an executive producer on the project. It will begin shooting in late 2014, Focus Features said. The screenplay has been penned by Lee Hall, who was Oscar-nominated for Billy Elliot, and recently worked on the film adaptation of War Horse. It follows Reginald Dwight's journey from childhood piano prodigy to global superstar, under his stage name Elton John. Hardy is respected for his wide-ranging talent, but his brawny, tattooed frame makes him an unconventional choice to star as the flamboyant musician. He is not the first actor to play Sir Elton. In 2001, Justin Timberlake appeared as a "young Elton" in the video for the latter's This Train Don't Stop There Any More. Last month, Sir Elton John played live at the Emmy Awards ceremony for the first time. He performed a tribute to Liberace, the American pianist and vocalist whose life was told in the recent biopic, Behind the Candelabra. </body>

      <body>Children's author Malorie Blackman has been named at the top of a list of the UK's most influential black figures. Blackman, who is the current Children's Laureate, topped publishing company Powerful Media's annual Powerlist. The author was followed in the top five by merchant banker Ken Olisa, barrister Matthew Ryder, athlete Mo Farah and media agency boss Karen Blackett. Blackman said: "Highlighting so many black people in such diverse different spheres is such an inspiring thing." She continued: "It challenges stereotypes and shows that many people are achieving great things. It's a fantastic showcase of the amazing success stories that often go unreported." Blackman began her career as a computer programmer and TV scriptwriter before being spurred to write her first book because of a dearth of children's stories featuring black characters. She has now written more than 60 books for children and teenagers, including Noughts and Crosses, Pig-Heart Boy, Hacker and Cloud-Busting. She was made Children's Laureate in June. At number two on the list, Ken Olisa runs merchant bank Restoration Partners and is a non-executive director at Thomson Reuters. A library at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, was recently named after Olisa after he made a £2m donation. The names were chosen by a five-person panel headed by management consultant Vivian Hunt and including Thomson Reuters executive Olakunle Babarinde. The Powerlist is sponsored by Thomson Reuters and Lloyds Bank. A spokesman for the Powerlist said the panel was independent and the rankings decided on merit. </body>

      <title>China sackings over ruined frescos</title>
      <description>Two officials in China are sacked after unauthorised restorers paint over ancient Buddhist temple frescos with cartoon-like figures from Taoist myths.</description>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <body>Three Romanian men have pleaded guilty to stealing seven paintings, including works by Picasso, Gauguin, Monet and Matisse, from a Dutch museum last year. Radu Dogaru, Alexandru Bitu and Eugen Darie told a Bucharest court they took the paintings from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam in October 2012. The suspects admitted they brought the paintings to Romania and had tried to sell them on the black market. The seven works have never been found and may have been burned. Thieves broke in through a rear emergency exit of the museum, grabbing the paintings off the wall and fleeing within minutes. The stolen works included two paintings by Monet, a 2002 piece by Lucien Freud and a self-portrait by the Dutch painter Meye de Haan. Speaking in court on Tuesday, Mr Dogaru said security had been "practically inexistent" and he had "entered practically just with a screwdriver". His lawyer went on to tell reporters his client said he had inside help. A spokeswoman for the museum declined to comment. Mr Dogaru told the court the paintings had been handed over to a Russian Ukrainian man and had not been burned in his mother's stove as had been suggested. Olga Dogaru, who is charged with handling stolen property, had told investigators she burned the paintings but later denied it. Her son also claimed at one point he had offered to return five of the paintings to Dutch authorities, but they had declined the offer and demanded all seven. Six Romanians have been put on trial in the case. One is still on the run and being tried in absentia. The next hearing in the case will be held on 19 November. </body>

      <body>Animated snail-racing tale Turbo has beaten Tom Hanks's true-life hostage drama Captain Phillips to the top of this week's UK box office. The Dreamworks film earned £3.9m including previews, compared with the £3.4m of Hanks's Paul Greengrass-directed thriller. Action stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone's prison break film Escape Plan was third with £961,470. The top five was rounded off by Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith. This week's figures are a lift on the previous seven days when Prisoners topped the chart for a third consecutive week, in a weekend which saw no release make more than £1m. Turbo, which features the voices of Ryan Reynolds and rapper Snoop Dogg, flopped when it was released in the US earlier this year, earning $21m (£13m) over its first weekend. With a reported budget of $135m (£83.6m) it only made $82.6m (£51.2m) in North America during its run, although it has since earned more than $224m (£139m) worldwide. Hanks, meanwhile, has won rave reviews for his role in the film about a container ship seized by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009. The film opened this year's London Film Festival. Bollywood action film Boss, starring Akshay Kumar, opened at number nine despite opening in just 63 screens. Averaging £3,732 per cinema, it took significantly more than Escape Plan's average of £2,656 per location across 362 screens. Romantic drama Enough Said, starring Sopranos actor James Gandolfini in one of his final film roles opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, missed out on a top 10 place but earned a respectable £170,357 from its 79 screens. While a second bad week for Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, saw it fall out of the top 10 to 13 after taking £118,397. </body>

      <body>Tim Burton is in talks to direct Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice 2, according to Hollywood trade magazines. Burton directed the first cult hit movie, which was released in 1988 and starred Keaton as a fast-talking, devious ghost from the underworld. The Frankenweenie director is currently working on the film Big Eyes, before going on to direct Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The original Beetlejuice spawned an animated TV series produced by Burton. The film also starred Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Burton has been nominated twice for Oscars in the animated feature category - for Corpse Bride in 2006, and last year for Frankenweenie. Beetlejuice won an Academy Award for best make-up in 1989. </body>

      <body>British film-maker Peter Greenaway is to receive the Stockholm Film Festival's prestigious visionary award. The festival's jury praised The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover director for "challenging the spectator like a true modern visionary". The jury said Greenaway had "created a new cinematic language by questioning traditional notions of artistic expression". Previous winners include Gus Van Sant and Wes Anderson. Greenaway has directed more than 50 films, including The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning By Numbers and The Pillow Book. The director and trained artist will receive his prize - a bronze horse statuette - in Stockholm on 8 November, where he will also take part in a meet-the-audience session. He is currently professor of film studies at the European Graduate School in Switzerland and has curated art exhibitions worldwide. Earlier this year, Greenaway announced he was returning to the UK to film an adaptation of Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. "There is a surge of film-making activity in England and the studios seem to be more available," he told Screen Daily. Greenaway has not made a film in Britain since The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, starring Dame Helen Mirren, in 1989. The film-maker famously declared that "cinema is dead" in 2002. The Stockholm Film Festival runs from 6 to the 14 November. Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is the opening film. </body>

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. Tributes have been pouring in for the legendary singer from the government, the film industry and his fans. President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led the country in paying tributes to Dey. India "has lost a veteran playback singer, a versatile artist of extraordinary ability and a creative genius who mesmerised listeners with his enchanting voice," the president said. The prime minister described Dey as the "king of melody" and said with his death, the music world had lost one of its most talented artistes. "I am deeply saddened to hear of the demise of the King of Melody, Manna Dey. An accomplished singer with a unique voice, he was multi-talented and excelled in Rabindra Sangeet and various other forms of popular music," he said in his condolence message. "In his death, the music world has lost one of its most talented artistes. Dey's legacy will, however, live on through the many songs he sang," Mr Singh added. Dey sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen; Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan; and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Dey's peers from Bollywood and fans took to Twitter to pay tribute to the singer. "Today, great classical singer Manna Dey sahab, who we fondly called Manna da, is not among us anymore. He had a very pleasant and easy personality. He was very dedicated to his work. I salute him and pray that his soul rests in peace," singer Lata Mangeshkar, who collaborated on innumerable hits with him, wrote on Twitter. Mangeshkar's duet Pyar hua ikraar hua (I admit I'm in love), played as background to film of actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis on a rainy night under an umbrella in Shri 420, is among the most popular romantic songs of Bollywood. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. RIP," tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP." Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." Dey, a Bengali, also charmed neighbouring Bangladesh with songs in his mother tongue and in a message on Thursday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Dey would remain alive forever among music-loving people of the subcontinent. "People will never forget his extraordinary melodious voice and unique style," she said. </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>Pop star Rihanna was asked to leave a famous Abu Dhabi mosque complex after posing outside the building for an unauthorised photo shoot. The singer tweeted pictures of herself in a black jumpsuit and headscarf on photo-sharing site Instagram. A statement from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre, said she was asked to leave after "inappropriate pictures" were taken. The photos "did not comply with terms and conditions" of organised visits. Rihanna performed live in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The mosque said Rihanna, 25, first arrived "at an entrance that was not designated for visitors". "She was confronted by the mosque officials and directed to the appropriate entrance to the mosque, to carry out a visit under the normal conditions." She was asked to leave after striking a series of poses for the photo shoot. The statement claimed Rihanna turned up at the mosque "without any previous co-ordination with the administration". Several of the photos could be construed as suggestive, with one showing the pop star lying on her back in the mosque's courtyard. The mosque is a major tourist attraction which welcomes non-Muslims - it had more than three million visitors last year. Rihanna's publicity team has yet to make a comment. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>Counter-terrorism saga Homeland has been renewed for another season by US cable channel Showtime, as has 1960s-set drama Masters of Sex. The fourth season of Homeland and the second of Masters of Sex will both comprise 12 episodes and air in 2014. The shows are aired on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday and Tuesday respectively. The most recent instalment of Homeland was watched by 1.97 million, while Tuesday's episode of Masters of Sex attracted 848,000 viewers. The overnight figures are down on the ratings achieved by the shows' debut episodes on 6 and 8 October respectively. Homeland, starring Claire Danes as troubled CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was watched by 3.31 million viewers when it returned to UK screens earlier this month. And the opening episode of Masters of Sex, which stars Britain's Michael Sheen as pioneering sex expert Dr William Masters, drew an audience of 1.43 million two days later. In the US, both shows are broadcast back-to-back on a Sunday night, with the most recent edition of the terrorism drama attracting 1.8 million viewers and Sheen's drama watched by 1.4 million. "Homeland continues to prove its strength for Showtime, and is one of television's most exciting, provocative and widely-discussed shows," David Nevins, president of entertainment at the network, said. "The critical and audience reaction to Masters of Sex since its great launch has been incredibly gratifying. It's a privilege to get to work with such talented and creative people as [Homeland creator] Alex Gansa and [Masters of Sex's] Michelle Ashford, as well as their tremendous casts. "They have each created truly original shows, with distinctive voices that are among the most admired series on television." </body>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police Service will be the subject of a BBC One documentary series that will go behind the scenes at Britain's largest police force. Channel controller Charlotte Moore said The Met would be the first "definitive" look at the "vital" organisation. Over six hour-long episodes, she said the public would see the police force "in a way never seen before". Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was "delighted" to work with the BBC "on such an important project". "I hope that over the coming months, we can reveal the true scale and complexity of the challenges faced by officers and staff across the service." According to the BBC, the show will "take an in-depth look at how the Metropolitan Police Service works" and "show the scale and complexity of policing London on a day-to-day basis". "We have been granted extraordinary, unprecedented access to film from top to bottom of the organisation," said Moore, who nurtured the series in her previous role as commissioning editor for documentaries. The BBC One announcement coincides with news from BBC Three about five new factual and current affairs series. These include Slum Survivors, a three-part series that tests young people's resourcefulness in the slums of Lagos, Mumbai and Jakarta, and The Human Tissue Team, a two-part look at tissue donation. </body>

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter reflects on hit horror Halloween as it turns 35</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296254</url>
      <date>1382574282</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70148000/jpg/_70148232_halloween_7.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <body>Brit Award-winning UK rapper Tinie Tempah tells how Adele helped him pick the songs for his new album - and why his old school might not like it. Tinie Tempah has no eyes on the cover of his new album. They've been scratched out, painted over. And deliberately so. "I'm trying to make it about the music again," he explains. "It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music. "Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying." Coming to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration. "Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?" he asks on Children of The Sun. On Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: "When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety." "You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity," says the 24-year-old. The success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns. But thankfully his new album isn't an awful "tears of a pop star" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships. Instead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: "Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!" "The most important thing is self-awareness," he says - but witty lyrics help, too. He writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) "to get in my jeans". Is it a true story? "It's not directly literal," he laughs. "Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'" Nonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room. "It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'" Born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham. His parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer. By the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December. The youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology. But his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009. Five of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too. But the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger. "There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world," says the musician. "It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'" Tinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online. "I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out," he says. "Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music. "If you empty your tank it'll refill again." Forever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago. He told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because "it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?" But off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place. "I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile," he says. He's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops. "People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'" he laughs. "I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway." However, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record. Lines like "I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans? "I definitely do think that," he says, "but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it. "You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?" He hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him. "I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me," he says. "I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground." "Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'" He certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood. "I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft. "She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera. "Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice." Unsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America. "Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America," he says. "It's just about being as big an artist as I can be. "I believe in the magic of music. Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world." Tinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October. His album, Demonstration follows on 4 November. </body>

      <body>Soul legend Edwin Starr had worldwide success in the 1960s and 70s with hits including the classic protest song War. But the Nashville-born singer spent the final years of his life thousands of miles from the Motown heartland of Detroit. He died in Chilwell - on the outskirts of Nottingham - in 2003. A decade later, Starr's younger brother Angelo Starr and manager Lilian Kyle look back on his life and chart his unusual journey to the English suburbs.

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid £100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had £2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Free school head checks scaled back</title>
      <description>Documents leaked to the BBC show ministers agreed to scrap pre-appointment checks on inexperienced free school heads despite warnings from civil servants.</description>

      <body>Checks on inexperienced staff who want to be head teachers at free schools have been scrapped, despite warnings from civil servants. Candidates without headship experience had been required to attend assessment centres to ensure they were "capable" of "setting up and running" a school. It comes as Nick Clegg says all schools should employ qualified teachers - free schools can employ unqualified staff. The government insists it closely monitors all head teacher appointments. But a leaked Department for Education document, seen by the BBC and the Guardian, reveals that civil servants were concerned that a lack of checks may lead to unsuitable candidates, referred to as principal designates, being appointed to run schools. It says: "Without the Principal Designate Assessment Centres some free school projects may appoint inexperienced principal designates who are not suitable which would significantly undermine the success of the school." Free schools, like academies, are different from regular state schools because they are allowed to hire unqualified teachers. (Independent schools can do this too.) Nonetheless the paper shows that ministers, including Secretary of State Michael Gove and David Laws, approved the scrapping of the requirement to attend assessment centres in February this year. They also approved a move to allow free school trusts to arrange their own pre-registration checks with Ofsted. These checks focus mainly on the safety of the building in which the school is to be run, and verify that child protection protocols, for example, have been met. It is the only check that the education inspectorate makes on free schools before they open and is particularly important as free schools are not monitored by local authorities, but are funded with taxpayers' money. After that initial check, Ofsted visit free schools within two years of them opening, as with all new schools. Civil servants writing the document, warn that groups may not arrange a "timely inspection when left to their own devices" and issues may be identified "that can't be resolved ahead of opening". This could lead to the schools not being legally ready to open as scheduled, the paper says. With free schools increasingly appearing on local authority school application forms, it could mean some parents who have picked the school for their child end up severely inconvenienced. Ofsted chief inspector Michael Wilshaw has stressed the need for good school leadership and for teachers who are up to the job. And Mr Gove has reduced the time it takes for school management to sack teachers who are not performing well enough. The scaling back of checks is part of departmental plans to save almost a third of its budget for free schools. However, the document also reveals that at the same time the DfE is planning to save 15% from its young people's and maintained schools groups budget "so that its increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time it is reducing the "financial analysis in support of the free school programme", the document shows. The paper warns: "The risk is that free school proposals will not be subject to financial scrutiny." As part of this the funding, allocation and payment systems are being switched from a face-to-face contact to a more web-based "self-service" system. The revelations come as a number of problems have been emerging at some free schools in recent weeks and months. Two schools, including the Al-Madinah faith school in Derby, were put into special measures to bring them up to scratch. And an unqualified head teacher stepped down from a free school in central London amid claims the governors may have regretted appointing an unqualified candidate. The Department for Education insists free schools are raising standards and said: "Assessment centres did not add value to the process. We undertake due diligence checks and closely monitor all proposed head teacher appointments - including having a representative on the recruitment panel in many cases." A spokesman said: "We have achieved this while maintaining proper scrutiny of free school applications and any suggestion that the process has been weakened is false. "Financial scrutiny of free school applications continues to be carried out by trained DfE staff with advice from financial experts. This allows a better overview of the whole application and approval process." Labour's shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan has now written to Mr Gove calling for him to publish the proposals for savings on free schools in full. He said: "Labour has long warned of the dangers of the free schools programme such as the lack of adequate oversight; the use of unqualified teachers; and their prioritisation ahead of addressing areas that desperately need new school places." Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "We are clear that head teachers need to have qualified teacher status no matter what the structure of the school. Teaching is a profession with an academic and theoretical foundation as well as the skills and craft gained through experience. "Parents are right to expect their child's teachers will be qualified as an assurance of their ability. Heads also value qualifications when recruiting. This is why we have welcomed Nick Clegg's acknowledgement today that teaching is a skilled profession." </body>

      <body>Record numbers of students have applied to study at Oxford or Cambridge in 2014, the two universities report. Oxford said it had received 17,480 applications for undergraduate places, up from 17,216 on the 2013 deadline. Cambridge said over 16,500 applicants for its courses this year represented a rise of almost 4% on last year. Data from admissions service Ucas also showed a slight rise in applications for medicine, dentistry and veterinary degrees as well as for Oxbridge. Oxford and and Cambridge share an early deadline for applications of 15 October with medicine, dentistry and veterinary courses because they are all heavily oversubscribed. Overall some 58,200 people applied by that date this year, compared with 56,810 last year. Much of the overall increase appears to be driven by applications from overseas. The figures include a 10% rise in applications from outside the European Union, with 11,230 people applying this year, against 10,240 last year. Cambridge attributed the highest number of applications since its records began to "extensive outreach work" and a "high-profile commitment to fair admissions". Mike Sewell, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: "It is great to see a record number of students who feel confident that they will be competitive applicants to Cambridge. "Cambridge is committed to evidence-based admissions decisions which take into account a student's most recent exam results. "Our applicants know that their applications will be assessed fairly on their track record and that places will be won on academic factors alone". The Ucas data shows 40,740 of the 15 October applications were from the UK, up from 40,600 last year. Applications from England rose from 35,970 in 2013 to 36,120 in 2014. Applications also increased from Wales (up 5%) and Scotland (up 2%) but dropped by 10% in Northern Ireland. This represents the highest number of applications from students in England since 2010. There were also more applications from the European Union, with a 4% rise on 2013, and a 10% rise in the numbers of non-EU applicants. Ucas chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: "It is encouraging to see that the number of UK applicants for these demanding courses is holding steady, particularly as the young population continues to fall in this group. "The number of international applicants is up by 10%." The application deadline for most other courses and universities is 15 January 2014 </body>

      <description>Fewer five-year-olds meet expected standards in maths and literacy than in other key measures, suggests new data.</description>

      <body>Fewer five-year-olds in England are achieving expected standards in maths and literacy than in other key measures, suggests new data. Some 61% achieved at least the expected level in literacy and 66% in maths, according to data published by the Department for Education (DfE). By contrast, 89% reached the expected level in physical development and 87% in expressive arts and design. The figures are based on simplified measures introduced in September 2012. The first assessments under the new Early Years Foundation Stage Profile were this summer. By the end of the school year in which they turn five, children are expected to be able to write simple stories, lists or letters. Reading ability is judged on measures such as being able to use cues such as pictures to understand basic sentences. In maths children are expected to be able to count to 20 and do simple adding adding and subtracting, as well as solve simple problems with shapes, measurements, time and money. Teachers assessing children at the end of their reception year at school now focus on 17 benchmarks in three prime areas of learning: The previous Early Years Foundation Stage, with 69 measures, had been criticised as too bureaucratic. The new data shows over half (52%) of children achieved a "good" level of development, which is considered to be at least the expected level within the three prime areas as well as the expected standards in literacy and mathematics. There was a substantial disparity between the achievement levels of girls and boys. "Girls outperformed boys in all areas of learning," says the DfE's summary of the findings. Some 60% of girls were assessed as having a good level of development, compared with 44% of boys. In literacy some 69% of girls achieved at least the expected level, compared with 53% of boys. The gap was narrower in mathematics, with 70% of girls achieving the expected level, against 63% of boys. A DfE spokeswoman said the new streamlined profile for the foundation stage "places a stronger emphasis on the areas which are most essential for a child's development and a greater focus on the key skills children need for a good start in life". The spokeswoman said reforms to childcare would help all children, regardless of their background, to get a good start in life. "Our reforms are also focusing on improving the quality of professionals working in the early years, by introducing early years teachers and early years educators into nurseries who will specialise in early childhood development. "Ofsted is introducing a tougher early years inspection framework to improve outcomes, and put a stronger emphasis on the areas which are most essential for a child's development, such as strong communications and a good vocabulary", she added. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: "Children in the UK already start formal schooling much earlier that in most other countries. "It is quite simply inappropriate to replace the developmental assessments at which teachers are proficient with rigid literacy and numeracy assessments. "What is needed in the early years is a broad approach to move children on in their learning, not a series of tests which could create a sense of failure." </body>

      <body>Nick Clegg has promised to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England. In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <title>Londoners 'taking university places'</title>
      <description>Young people in the capital are much more likely to go to university than anywhere else in England, a study reports.</description>

      <body>Young people in London are 43% more likely to go to university than their counterparts in the north-east of England, says a report from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The funding council has published an analysis of changing patterns of young people going to university. It shows a widening regional gap, with Londoners taking an increasingly disproportionate number of places. The gender gap has widened too, with women more likely to go to university. The study from the funding council examines trends in young people entering higher education in England, between 1998-99 and 2011-12. The overall underlying trend is that more young people are going to university, with the proportion of 18-year-olds getting places rising from 30% to 38%. But this is not an even spread. The increase has been much greater among young women, with a current gender gap of 12%, compared with 3% in the late 1990s. This gender gap was even more extreme in the poorest areas, with women 35% more likely to go to university. The gap in university entry between rich and poor remains as wide in this decade as it was in the 1990s, although both groups have increased their numbers. "Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas," says the study, observing that the difference remained "broadly stable". But there had been significant regional shifts. London had the highest levels of participation in 1988-99 and this was even more pronounced by 2011-12. The proportion going to university has risen from 35% to 48%. Schools in the capital have become among the highest performing in the country and a much higher proportion of youngsters go on to university than anywhere else. What makes this particularly striking is that in 1998-99, youngsters in London in poorer "low participation" areas were the least likely in the country to go to university. But by 2011-12 they had gone from the bottom to the top of the regional league table. There are 23% of youngsters in London living in poorer areas now entering university. The lowest level of entry among the most deprived is now in the south-east, previously amongst the highest. The study says that more than half of all the extra disadvantaged entrants brought into higher education across England were from London. The highest level of participation by constituency, Wimbledon, has four times the level of university entry for the lowest, Nottingham North. This more local breakdown showed the highest levels of university entry in south-west and north-west London, with the highest rates of increase clustered around north-east and south-east London. The report highlights the places with the lowest levels of university entry, coastal towns, former industrial towns in the midlands and north, rural areas of the south-west, the east midlands and east of England. Along with Nottingham North, the other lowest individual constituency was Bristol South. In terms of the increase in the young people going to university, the biggest increases in the country were in Barking, Lewisham Deptford, Croydon North, Bermondsey and Greenwich. In contrast, North West Norfolk, Bognor Regis and Copeland in Cumbria saw numbers going into reverse. The lowest regional level of increase over these years was the south-west. Prof Les Ebdon, head of the Office for Fair Access, welcomed the "sustained progress" in increasing participation in higher education. But he said that narrowing the gap between the most and least advantaged would mean early intervention. "This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students." He also warned that the fall in part-time student numbers would have a disproportionate impact on poorer families. Rachel Wenstone, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said: "It's fantastic to see that young people still recognise the value of higher education, but it remains a national embarrassment that where you're from remains such a key factor in whether or not you go on to university." Prof Michael Gunn, chair of Million+, representing new universities, said: "The increase in the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is one of the great British success stories of the last 15 years. "This is the result of governments being willing to fund an expansion in university places and widening participation initiatives and modern universities rising to the challenge. Without this commitment and increased investment in schools it is unlikely that any of this would have happened." </body>

      <body>Staff at a school in Gloucestershire that became infested with venomous spiders have denied they overreacted by closing for a day. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean on Wednesday after false widow spiders were found earlier in the week. Some people have criticised the closure, saying the creature's bite is not serious. A spokesman said the school had taken advice from environmental health. The school's education adviser, Phil Lomax, said: "We haven't overreacted at all. "When there's infestation of any kind in a school building it's important to take careful consideration of risk to health and well-being. "In this particular case, with the advice from environmental health, a quick fumigation allowing the fumes to clear and [get] back to normal was the best solution. "You can't actually know whether some students may be more susceptible to bites, stings from wasps, spiders or any other [bugs] either, so I think we've taken a balanced view here in the best interests of students." Some parents told the BBC they thought it had been wrong for the whole school to be shut while the problem was dealt with. Entomologist Steven Falk said: "[The noble false widow] has got a toxic bite but the bite is on a par with a honey-bee sting. "They're nowhere near as dangerous as the media is making out, so we're a little bit surprised [that the school was closed]." There were no reports of anyone being bitten by the arachnids, and the school reopened as normal on Thursday after Wednesday's fumigation. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most venomous of the dozen or so species of biting spider known in Britain. Its bite can cause severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <description>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England.</description>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <title>Near-drowned woman can pursue payout</title>
      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no-one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called in metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <title>University sells study-free MBA</title>
      <description>An online university sold a top degree for thousands of pounds with no work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation reveals.</description>

      <body>A so-called university sold an MBA degree for thousands of pounds with no academic work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation has revealed. The American University of London (AUOL) awarded a fictitious person created by the programme a Master's in Business in exchange for a £4,500 fee. AUOL has insisted it is "not a bogus university" and defended the robustness of the qualifications it offers. Newsnight has found hundreds of senior executives listing AUOL qualifications. The programme contacted some of them, but they all insisted that they had had to study for their degrees. AUOL styles itself as a pioneer of distance learning, offering degrees and post-graduate qualifications in business, IT, law, education and liberal arts, humanities, and English to more than 100,000 students worldwide. Its website claims that that all of their courses "have been designed to the most exacting standards, in accordance with the most stringent criteria, in order to provide outstanding education at an affordable price". However, Newsnight found that getting the university to provide a qualification without any study at all was easy. The programme drew up a one-page fake CV for a management consultant Peter Smith, known as Pete, living in South London, which included 15 years of made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree from a UK university. The real Pete was actually a dog living in Battersea Dogs' Home. Newsnight sent "Pete's" CV to AUOL, along with a completed application for the Master's in Business (MBA) and £50 application fee. AUOL also requires applicants to provide photocopies of previous qualifications and a photograph of themselves. However, Newsnight was unable to provide either since the qualifications did not exist and the applicant was a dog. Despite these omissions, just four days after sending in the application, AUOL sent "Pete" an e-mail saying that his application for a degree based on previous experience had been successful and that once the university had received his £4,500 fee he would be registered as an MBA graduate within about two weeks. When Newsnight's reporter telephoned to check whether "Pete" would be required to submit any work, a university representative said: "No, no, apparently the APEL [Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning] board awarded him the full degree immediately based on his qualification and his professional experience, so he doesn't have to do any courses." We showed our written application to Jan Bamford at London Met University which runs properly accredited MBA courses. She was incredulous that a degree could be awarded to someone "with such limited work experience and such a poor application". "I find it incredible that any organisation is awarding an MBA on what essentially amounts to the evidence that is on a piece of paper. That's appalling. Really appalling. And again it goes to the very heart of the fact the government needs to regulate this behaviour," she added. In order to hand out a British degree an institution has to be recognised by Parliament. However, it is perfectly legal to give the impression that a university is run in the UK even when in reality it is incorporated overseas. AUOL is one such place - seemingly based in London, but actually incorporated in St Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, as they state on their website. Despite its name, AUOL does not seem to have any physical presence in London. Newsnight found that the university's phone number is a Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, area code and that the bank that university fees are paid to is in Beaconsfield. According to public records, including the electoral roll, Professor Michael Nimier, who was the founder of AUOL, and Sonia Grimes, who is the registrar, live in the town. On its website, AUOL boasts some well qualified supervisors and says that "the university's academic staff are highly qualified and experienced". But when we contacted five Western academics on its list, all said they had never worked there and never agreed for their name to be used. George Gollin, an American academic with expertise in unaccredited education, told Newsnight that AUOL "did not stand up to scrutiny". "It doesn't have authority to award degrees. They are not degrees. They are pieces of paper and I'm guessing they are not able to sell very many degrees into countries where English is the first language." The university says most of its graduates study at independent colleges in countries overseas. Those affiliates are apparently independent with their own staff subject to their own local laws. AUOL simply takes a fee to help set the curricula and issue graduation certificates in its own name. On professional social networking sites Newsnight found hundreds of senior executives who said they had qualifications from AUOL. The programme spoke to a number of them, all of whom insisted that they did have to submit work to get their degrees. Dr Robert Oakes, a psychologist from Birmingham, who gives expert testimony in court cases, was awarded a PhD just five months after first submitting work. However, he told the programme that he had spent 18 months on his own background research prior to this and he was already a registered psychologist based on a previous degree. Dr Oakes said he believed AUOL was properly accredited, but that he has now taken the qualification off his CV. Dr Rita Bowser, a senior nuclear industry executive who was in charge of selling a new generation of reactors in the UK, was awarded a doctorate in business after submitting what she described as "significant amounts of coursework". Her employer, Westinghouse, said she is well qualified for her job based on 30 years of experience and two previous degrees including a master's from the respected Georgia Tech. Since AUOL is not properly accredited it is not possible to verify how much work they did, nor what standard was required. The university has claimed to be recognised by three different American institutions, but these institutions are themselves unofficial and unrecognised. The university is listed as "bogus" by the agency that values degrees for the Italian government and it has been blacklisted in five US states, including Texas where it is illegal to use any of its qualifications to get a job. In a statement AUOL told Newsnight: "We are not a bogus university… and have always been upfront about our status. We have not applied for accreditation with any American, British or other official agency. Many graduates go on to higher education or hold important positions on the strength of our degrees." The university added that most of its study modules are on a par with those used by top distance learning universities and that it only issues degrees based on work experience in exceptional circumstances. </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>'Students need eating-disorder help'</title>
      <description>Students with eating disorders can struggle to get treatment they need while at university, says a charity.</description>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." The National Union of Students (NUS) said it was working to make support for mental health issues a higher priority in universities and colleges. Vice-president Colum McGuire said: "For some the stress and new surroundings that come with leaving to go to university can trigger mental health issues." "NUS is concerned about cuts to services that support students facing these challenges, particularly around poor referrals on to outside services, and whether those services themselves actually have adequate resources to help students." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>Child psychologist provision warning</title>
      <description>A national steering group warns that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low.</description>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads. Ackeem has developed a wheel that can be manually adapted to suit different terrains. But will he reach his target, and develop the project which has become his obsession?

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24476860</url>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>Scottish Power raises prices by 8.6%</title>
      <description>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% on dual-fuel energy bills in the same week as being hit by a penalty for its sales tactics.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>The Bank of England (BoE) intends to boost the availability of finance for banks a move which could help them lend to consumers. Describing the bank as "open for business" he said the BoE would offer money for longer periods and widen the range of assets accepted as collateral. He justified the move by saying that banks are healthier and have to meet tougher standards. He also said there were reasons to believe the recovery is sustainable. "One of the reasons to think there could be some sustainability, some traction in the recovery is that the core of the financial system has gotten a lot better." "I won't say it's fully healed but it's gotten a lot better and the rebuilding of (bank) capital is a big element of that," he said. He accepted that the reputation of the banking system had been damaged over the last few years. Carney added that when he visited the UK as governor of the Bank of Canada during the crisis, he was struck how different the attitude was towards the banking sector. He said that "loathing" of the banking sector had replaced the confidence of the past. The Bank of England governor was speaking at a gathering marking the 125th anniversary of the Financial Times newspaper. </body>

      <description>Political leaders express optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accept a survival plan.</description>

      <body>Political leaders have expressed optimism for the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant after unions accepted a survival plan put forward by management. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael spoke to plant owners Ineos on Thursday afternoon. Unite had earlier agreed to "embrace" the firm's proposals "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs on Wednesday. Workers had previously rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Meanwhile, Ineos said the number of contractors who have been laid off at the Grangemouth complex, since the dispute started last week, had reached 2,000. Workers from Doosan Babcock leaving the plant said that more than 100 of them had just been told that there was no more work. Other companies are understood to have given a similar message to staff in the past 24 hours. Several of those affected blamed Ineos staff for holding out against changes to pay and pensions. Earlier, UK and Scottish governments representatives had expressed optimism over the future of the petrochemical and refinery at Grangemouth. After meeting with Ineos, Mr Carmichael said: "We are in a much better place today in relation to the future of the plant than we were yesterday. "There remains, of course, a great deal to be done." Finance Secretary John Swinney commented: "Behind us is a plant of over 1,000 high quality jobs in refining and petrochemicals, these are very skilled high quality jobs and the Scottish economy and UK economy requires that economic impact. "This plant has got a great future, everybody accepts that Grangemouth has got a great future. "What we need to do is resolve these outstanding issues, get the investment plan implemented and take forward and improve the prospects for the people that work in this plant." Ineos has said it plans to make an official statement on the Grangemouth issue on Friday. The BBC understands that some kind of agreement is being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. Local MP Michael Connarty said he believed the union would be making no challenges to the survival plan and would be accepting it in full. He added: "As far as I understand the company are away to draft it into a legal document which the convenor will sign on behalf of the shop stewards committee, and that will then be binding on the workforce in the plant." Unite earlier said it had made a number of recommendations to Ineos at its meeting on Thursday morning. General secretary Len McCluskey said: "This plant is on cold shut down and each day that goes by makes it harder to start back up again, which is why the stewards made the offer to the company - so that we can get people back to work." He said the union would not let the plant close, adding Unite had been "encouraged" by similar comments from First Minister Alex Salmond. Mr McCluskey has told Ineos he wants to meet Mr Ratcliffe for face-to-face discussions, arguing it would be an opportunity for him to "clarify" Unite's position and for Mr Ratcliffe to raise the assurances he was seeking. Mr McCluskey added: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during a visit to Yorkshire, said he remained hopeful a resolution to the dispute could be reached. He added: "This is an important business for Scotland, it's a very important industry for the whole of the United Kingdom. "We want to see those jobs saved, we want to see this business thrive, and I'm hopeful that agreements will be reached." Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had discussed the crisis with Unite and believed the union "fully understands the gravity of the situation". "They want to represent their members, and rightly so, and they're concerned about their members' jobs and livelihoods," he added. Before the talks with Unite, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that £300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" David Watt, from the Institute of Directors, said it was "quite sad" that the dispute at Grangemouth had reached this point. He commented: "It's rather gloomy in the way this has developed. I would have hoped both parties could have negotiated over a longer period. "I think there are opportunities but it's quite sad that we've got to this point. "There are probably faults by both sides." And he said he was surprised that the union thought the closure announcement was a shock. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Private equity firm buys Dr Martens</title>
      <description>R Griggs Group, the owner of Dr Martens, has agreed to a £300m takeover offer from the investment firm Permira Funds.</description>

      <body>The owner of shoe brand Dr Martens has been bought by investment firm Permira Funds for £300m. R Griggs Group, based in Wollaston, near Northampton, has been making boots since 1901, but became famous with its Dr Martens boot in the 1960s. The deal adds to Permira's portfolio of fashion businesses, which includes Hugo Boss, New Look and Spain's Cortefiel. Griggs was the first firm to use an air-cushioned sole, developed by Munich-based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck. The boot that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. The firm also credits Peter Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who, as another early adopter. According to the company, Mr Townshend says that, while on tour, he would go to bed with two things: a cognac bottle and a Dr Martens boot. The boots also become popular with punks in the 1970s and had a resurgence when Britpop emerged in the 1990s. More recently, singers Miley Cyrus and Gwen Stefani have performed in Dr Martens, introducing a new generation to the boots. Dr Martens now sells about five million pairs of shoes a year. Most are made overseas, but 70,000 a year are still produced at its factory in Northampton. Under the leadership of chief executive David Suddens, Dr Martens has doubled the size of the business over the last four years. Since 2010, it has opened 30 Dr Martens stores and intends to open another 40 over the next four years, with a particular focus on China Mr Suddens told the BBC that Permira had "bought into" the current management's growth plan and was "excited" about the growth prospects. "The Permira Funds respect that heritage and wants to support the management team in nurturing it," he said. He also said the company was working on new products for the US, which accounts for more than 40% of its sales. Dr Martens expects to make a profit of more than £30m this year. </body>

      <title>Tax penalties threat from HMRC</title>
      <description>People who miss a paper tax return deadline of 31 October could face a penalty of £100, but there is leniency for high earners getting child benefit.</description>

      <body>People who miss a paper tax return deadline of 31 October could face a penalty of £100, but there is leniency for high earners getting child benefit. The late-filing penalty is an annual threat for those who complete self-assessment forms on paper. The deadline for online returns is 31 January, after which the same penalty from HM Revenue and Customs applies. Many people, who face a tax charge because they receive child benefit, will be filing for the first time. Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected by the changes to child benefit. They are losing some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000. Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children. The new rules mean that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning a taxable income of between £50,000 and £60,000. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions. The amount of benefit they are not entitled to is clawed back by HMRC through the tax system, which is why they need to complete a tax return. Those affected should already have registered for self-assessment and technically face a £100 fine if they have failed to do so by now. HMRC said that 145,000 of these higher-earning parents had still failed to register. This estimate is higher than the previous estimate of 110,000. A spokesman for the tax authority said the discrepancy was due to human error. Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told the Public Accounts Committee: "Some 325,000 opted out [of child benefit] by 7 January. Another 65,000 or so have opted out since, and 425,000 were in self-assessment anyway. We also needed to get in another 325,000 [registered]. "I actually gave out an overly optimistic figure about a week ago, because immediately after the weekend, we thought that that had dropped to 110,000, but we got over-excited and double counted some people in that weekend. "From now until the end of the year, we will continue to try - by direct letter, by media and by any means we can - to get the rest of those people to take action before the due date." No fines had been handed out so far, and none will be before the end of January, HMRC said. Any parent in this position who registers now will be given three months to complete their tax return, either on paper or online. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the ACCA, said: "The first which you must do if you missed the deadline is not think if you don't contact HMRC nothing will happen. HMRC will know about you sooner or later. "The law is the law and you need to adhere to it. Therefore contact HMRC and register. I would suggest if you are in any doubt at all call HMRC but remember it will still be up to you to decide whether you should register. "If you are near the £50,000 threshold be aware that any benefits you have, interest or dividends, or freelance work could push you over. So accurately work out your income." </body>

      <body>Lloyds Banking Group is in talks to sell an asset management business to Aberdeen Asset Management. In a statement, Aberdeen said it was discussing a possible strategic partnership with Lloyds Banking Group and a plan to buy Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP). SWIP currently manages funds of just over £145bn. The purchase would be funded by issuing new shares in Aberdeen to Lloyds, and a deferred cash payment deal. The cash would be conditional on the business's performance over a period of years, Aberdeen said. Aberdeen Asset Management said: "The potential acquisition would add further scale and diversity to the company's product range. "There can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to any transaction or any certainty as to the terms on which any such transaction might proceed. Further statements will be made if and when appropriate." Aberdeen Asset Management said in July that its total funds under management dropped by 1% in the three months to the end of June to £209.6bn. It blamed volatile global markets for the fall. </body>

      <title>French clubs to strike over tax row</title>
      <description>French football clubs in the top two divisions will go on strike for four days in November in protest at 'super taxes'.</description>

      <body>French clubs will go on strike in November in protest at plans to impose higher taxes on players' wages. The government wants a 75% 'super tax' on those earning an annual salary of more than 1m euros (£850,000) . Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of professional clubs' union UCPF, said: "There will be a weekend without a game at the end of the month (November)." The strike will affect matches in Ligue 1 and 2 - the top two divisions - from 29 November to 2 December. Under the proposal, companies, rather than individuals, would be liable to pay the 75% tax rate for the part of employees' annual salaries that exceed 1million euros. Paris St-Germain, who are backed by Qatar investors, will be the hardest hit by the tax. Monaco, who are funded by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, will be exempt as they do not fall under French tax laws. The concern among clubs is that the 'super tax' will deter footballers from playing for sides in France. The issue will be debated in parliament, and French president Francois Hollande will meet representatives of the French clubs next week to discuss the issue. Initial plans were for individuals earning more than 1million euros to pay the 75% rate, but the government changed the proposals after protests by top French executives and actors such as Gerard Depardieu. Ligue 1 clubs registered a loss of 108 million euros (£92m) at the end of the 2011-12 season with the accumulated loss over the last three seasons amounting to 303m euros (£259m). Louvel added: "There is already a deficit in our sector and now they impose a new tax. Football has a role in society and that will be affected as a consequence of these new measures. "This unprecedented day is an opportunity for the silent majority of French football to express their opposition." </body>

      <body>Ford has raised its profit forecast for the year amid continued strength in its home market. Previously the company said that profits this year would match last year's, but Ford now expects to exceed the $8bn made in 2012. Third quarter profit fell 22% to $1.27bn (£780m), but that included a $250m charge to reorganise its business in Europe. Ford's North American unit reported a profit of $2.3bn for the third quarter. In a statement with the results, Bob Shanks, chief financial officer, said: "We substantially reduced our losses in Europe, set a record third quarter profit in Asia Pacific Africa and saw a $150m improvement in South America." Losses in Europe narrowed to $228m in the third quarter, an improvement on the same quarter in 2012 when it lost $470m. According to Mr Shanks, car sales in Europe will see "very, very modest growth" in the near term. Overall sales in the third quarter rose 12% to $36bn. Ford's business in North America has been helped by strong sales of its very profitable pick-up trucks. Ford has been selling more than 60,000 of its F-series truck every month for the past five months, around a 10% improvement on 2012. Ian Henry, director at AutoAnalysis, said: "At the moment it is quite unusual for a volume car manufacturer to upgrade [its profit forecast]." In a difficult economic climate, consumers tended to either opt for "better-value brands", such as Hyundai or Dacia, or spend the extra cash on premium brands, he said. Mr Henry said this meant "volume car" manufacturers, such as Ford, Fiat, or Vauxhall, were typically not so popular. "Ford must be pretty confident," he added. Speculation has surrounded Ford's chief executive Alan Mulally, who has reportedly been talking to Microsoft about a possible move to replace outgoing chief executive Steve Ballmer. But when asked about the matter at Ford's press conference, Mr Mulally said: "We don't comment on the speculation." Mr Mulally said the company's plan to keep him as chief executive until the end of 2014 was unchanged. He has been running the auto maker since 2006 and is the third-longest serving chief executive in Ford's history, after Henry Ford I and Henry Ford II. He has received praise for helping Ford to avoid the government bailouts needed by its competitors General Motors and Chrysler in 2009. </body>

      <title>Primark extends Bangladesh payments</title>
      <description>Discount clothes chain Primark says it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh.</description>

      <body>Discount clothes chain Primark has said it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. Primark told the BBC it would continue to pay the wages of those affected for another three months. The collapse, which happened in April, killed more than 1,100 people. International firms have since faced criticism for lack of collective action to improve the working conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories. In addition to the death toll, more than 2,500 were injured in the disaster. Last month, the global trade union IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a long-term compensation fund of $74.6m (£47.2m) for the workers injured in the disaster, and the families of those who died. However, only nine of the 23 brands being produced at the Rana Plaza factory were represented at the meeting. Key absentees included Wal-Mart and Benetton and the retailers failed to reach a deal on a compensation fund for victims. The garments manufacturing sector is a key driver of Bangladesh's economy. However, a series of incidents has raised concerns over the working conditions in some of the factories in the country. Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes factory in the same area, and nine died in a blaze earlier this month at a garment manufacturer, again near the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. In September, the BBC's Panorama programme reported that Bangladeshi garment workers had been locked in on 19-hour shifts. As a result, there have been calls to improve the conditions at the units, prompting some action from various stakeholders. But earlier this week, Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed to launch a $24m initiative to improve the conditions of garment workers. In May, many international retailers agreed to a new code of practice regarding safety inspections for factories. At the time of the IndustriALL meeting, Primark said that it would continue to pay wages to those affected by the fire and building collapse for another three months, having paid for the previous three. The new announcement takes the total to nine months. In his first interview with the BBC, Paul Lister, head of corporate governance at Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods, said that "a lot has been done" since the fire to improve standards, and that the events of April were a "huge tragedy". "We looked on in horror. We knew our clothes were in the building, and we accepted responsibility," he said. When asked what he thought about other retailers not participating in compensation schemes, he said there was "still a long way to go" and that it was "time for others to step up". Mr Lister added that Primark would also welcome a rise in the minimum wage for garment workers. The minimum wage for a worker in such a factory is currently around 3,000 Bangladeshi taka a month (about £24; $40). When shown a Primark T-shirt costing just £2.50 and asked whether selling cheap clothes meant the people making them had to endure low pay and long hours, he said this was not the case, and that Primark's clothes were "ethically sourced". Mr Lister added that Primark and other low-price retailers often shared factory facilities and manufacturing bases with much more expensive brands. "We share 95% of our factories with other high street retailers. We share factories with Bond Street retailers. It's the same conditions, the same workforce, the same pay." "We know the factory where that T-shirt is made, we will have inspected that factory... we often sit outside factories to make sure the timesheets are correct." Mr Lister insisted that although a worker in a Bangladeshi factory would earn around 10p an hour, the garment industry had a positive impact on the country. "There are four million employed [in the textile industry], 80% of Bangladeshi exports are clothes. It is a way to alleviate poverty. It is a force for good." </body>

Its annual infrastructure report looked at mobile coverage on roads for the first time. While motorways have good 3G coverage, just 35% of the UK's A and B roads are served by all four mobile networks. The report found that 9% of roads have no 3G coverage at all. The latest trends in mobile and broadband outlined by the report are designed to give a snapshot of the UK's communications market. Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of superfast speeds, defined by the watchdog as 30Mbps (megabits per second) or above. That equates to 22% of connections, up from 10% last year. There are several reasons why consumers may be reluctant to upgrade, thinks Andrew Ferguson from broadband news site ThinkBroadband. "The usual factors we encounter from consumers are resistance to any increase in price, and the £10 to £20 premium for faster services can deter many, particularly if paying under £10 for their broadband service now," he said. "There are also a good number who after not getting speeds close to the advertised speeds previously are wary of upgrading for little or no benefit," he added. The appetite for data is huge though - Britons use 650 million gigabytes in an average month, equivalent to more than one billion copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to the report. Ofcom believes that there are two main factors contributing to this deluge of data - the fact that many households have lots of devices wanting to connect to the internet and the need for high-quality on-demand TV services. Outside the home, people are also demanding more connectivity. According to the report the number of public wi-fi hotspots in the UK has doubled from 16,000 to 34,000 over the last year. The amount of data being sent or received from these hotspots has almost trebled, to almost 2 million gigabytes a month. Meanwhile 4G services continue to be rolled out by the UK's mobile operators. As well as looking at coverage on the UK's roads, Ofcom is also looking at 3G services on railways although the results will not be released until next year. "We know consumers increasingly expect superfast speeds, but it is also important to make sure people can connect over a very wide area. That is why we are doing everything we can to support moves to improve coverage in difficult areas such as roads and train lines," said Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive. </body>

      <body>UK car production continued to strengthen last month, industry figures have shown, with output now having passed the one million mark this year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said production rose to 140,888 in September, up 9.9% from a year ago. The figures means output for 2013 so far has now reached 1,125,433. In addition, car production for the 12 months to September hit 1.5 million, the highest rolling 12-month total since October 2008. The number of cars produced for export rose 9.3% from a year earlier, helped by high demand in China, Russia and the US for luxury British brands. Mike Hawes, chief executive at SMMT, said the sector was "one of the UK's biggest success stories in recent years". "This long-term financial commitment and robust demand for UK-built products show the global appetite for high-quality, desirable products borne of the UK's world-class design, RandD and engineering," he added. However, while car output rose, production of commercial vehicles (CV) - lorries, buses, trucks and vans - fell 27.6% from a year earlier to 6,963. "CV production remained subdued in September, with continuing uncertainty in the EU and restructuring of UK operations," said Mr Hawes. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>David Cameron announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But the Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. He insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. But Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the government of coming up with a "panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers". During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron would "stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In a speech, Mr Miliband argued the prime minister had "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. He accused Mr Cameron of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, adding: "Governments have always looked at this balance but this government wants you to pick up the tab for its failure to stand up to the energy companies. That won't offer the real help that business and families need. "They propose a panicked wheeze paid for by taxpayers. We offer a real freeze paid for by the big energy companies." </body>

      <body>The pace of growth among businesses in the eurozone eased in October as the service sector slowed, a survey has indicated. The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from research firm Markit fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September. However, a reading above 50 still implies expansion, and activity has now grown for four months in a row. Markit said expansion was "broad-based" across the eurozone, although growth slowed in both Germany and France. Germany - which has been the main economic powerhouse for the eurozone in recent years - saw growth slow to a three-month low. Markit also noted that the eurozone's jobs market remained weak. Employment fell for the 22nd month in a row, with the rate of job losses picking up from September. "The survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Spain's economy - which was one of the hardest hit by the credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn - has shown signs this week that it is slowly starting to recover. Official figures show the country's unemployment rate - which is one of the highest in Europe - fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, to 26% from 26.3% in the previous quarter. On Wednesday, the Bank of Spain said the country's economy had emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years. The bank estimated that Spain's economy grew by 0.1% between July and September. The eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter of this year when it grew by 0.3% following a record 18 months of economic contraction. However, earlier this month, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the recovery in the bloc remained "weak, fragile, uneven". He said further support for the banking sector could not be ruled out, and that the ECB was "ready to consider all available instruments" to maintain financial stability and ensure that recovery in the eurozone took hold. There has been speculation that the ECB might offer another round of cheap, long-term loans to banks to keep the cost of credit down. </body>

      <body>Department store group Debenhams has reported a small drop in full-year profits, and says shoppers' incomes are expected to remain under pressure. The retailer said profits fell 2.7% to £154m for the year to 31 August, with sales up 2.5% to £2.78bn. It said online sales, up by 46.2%, were "well ahead of the market". Online accounted for 13.2% of its total sales. Chief executive Michael Sharp said he was pleased with the results given the "very difficult conditions". He said he expected shoppers' incomes to stay under pressure, giving that price inflation growing ahead of wages. Mr Sharp added: "With this in mind, we remain cautious about the strength and pace of any consumer recovery in 2014 and expect the marketplace to remain highly competitive." Debenhams said it would open four more stores in the UK in 2014. </body>

      <title>N Ireland 'UK's happiest nation'</title>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>'Bags-for-life' could cost extra 5p</title>
      <description>The 5p levy on plastic carrier bags could be extended to so-called 'bags-for-life' raising their price to 15p.</description>

      <body>The 5p charge on single use carrier bags in Wales could be extended to heavy-duty so-called "bags-for-life". Welsh government ministers are considering removing the exemption on the heavier bags. The single-use bag charge was introduced two-years ago, cutting use of the bags in Wales by 90%. Ministers say there is a risk that the heavier bags are now being treated as "throw-away", even though retailers charge between 5p and 10p for them. In their proposals for the environment bill, the government says ministers should have powers to impose a minimum charge on bags-for-life if they believe the sale and disposal of them continues to rise. Recent data has shown the sale of bags-for-life by supermarkets in Wales has more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. In terms of weight, this corresponds to around 30% of the reduction in weight of the thin-gauge single-use bags. In their white paper on the bill, the government says: "An increase in demand for bags-for-life was expected in Wales following the introduction of the charge as consumers got used to reusing their bags and purchased enough bags-for-life for their shopping needs. "However, there is a potential risk that many consumers start treating a low-cost reusable plastic bag as a 'throw-away bag' and discard it prematurely. "This 'substitution effect' is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts if these types of bags are disposed of inappropriately; as such bags are typically made of heavier gauge materials and take longer to degrade." The government has also stated that it will not prevent retailers donating the 5p levy to any good cause, not just the environmental charities that were originally envisaged. It said: "From the information provided by the 246 retailers that have signed up to the code on the Welsh government website and from the retailers' records we have seen, many of the good causes that are currently benefitting from the net proceeds are, for example, cancer charities and children's hospices amongst others. "The Welsh government's stated policy aim in relation to the charge is that it would prefer that environmental good causes benefit from the charge. "However, the Welsh government does not wish to cut across the existing relationships that retailers have with other good causes that contribute to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of Wales." The proposals in the bill come ahead of a review of the current bag charging policy, which will take place next year. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that review will also examine the practices of some retailers. He said: "There is a policy review, which will be undertaken after November of next year, but, certainly, at this moment in time, there are no plans to change the levy. "It depends, of course, on what that review shows and on what we see as the practices of some supermarkets at the moment, which are charging just 1p more for bags for life, thus, avoiding, in some ways, the levy. "We will have to keep a close eye on that, of course." </body>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by £789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by £3.5m and by £2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was £63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments over whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <body>Spain's economy has emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years, according to estimates from the Bank of Spain. Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.1% between July and September, the bank said. However, GDP was still 1.2% lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Spain's economy has been struggling ever since the credit crisis struck in 2008. The bank's figures are an estimate, and the country's National Statistics agency INE is due to release preliminary third quarter GDP data on 30 October. The Bank of Spain said the country's economy had been helped by stronger exports in the past quarter. "The slight recovery in activity in the third quarter after the fall a quarter earlier is due to... a more favourable contribution from the external sector," it said in its monthly bulletin. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the fallout from the credit crisis. The crisis burst the country's housing bubble, and its banks needed government bailouts to survive after being left holding hundreds of billions of euros in bad debts. Its unemployment rate of more than 26% is one of the highest in Europe. Government austerity measures aimed at cutting Spain's large deficit prompted huge protests across the country last year. However, the government recently claimed that the end of the recession was near, saying reforms and austerity measures were paying off. Ignacio del Torre, economist at financial advisory firm Arcano, said: "After recently implemented reforms, Spain has become an export powerhouse. "It will fully leave the recession behind in 2014 with private investment and consumption growth turning positive after three years of decline and credit levels stabilising," he added. </body>

      <title>Bank says UK prospects improving</title>
      <description>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to the Bank of England's latest minutes.</description>

      <body>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to Bank of England policymakers. Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's October meeting show that prospects for the rest of 2013 are better than was forecast in August. The minutes show that the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The MPC noted that business and consumer confidence continued to grow. The UK unemployment rate is currently at 7.7%. In August, when the Bank unveiled its strategy of forward guidance, the rate stood at 7.8%. At that time the Bank predicted it would take three years for the rate to fall to 7%, the rate at which it will start to consider interest rate rises. The October minutes said: "It now therefore seemed probable that unemployment would be lower, and output growth faster, in the second half of 2013 than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report." However, policymakers were divided about how fast productivity would pick up, and by extension, how fast unemployment would fall as the economy recovers. "It was too soon to draw a firm conclusion from recent labour market outturns about the extent to which productivity would increase," the minutes said. MPC members also noted a strengthening in sterling, which would push down on inflation. The Bank's goal is to return consumer price inflation to 2%. Inflation has exceeded 2% since December 2009, and currently stands at 2.7%. </body>

      <title>The tech boss who says it is all about the staff</title>
      <description>A profile of Robert Stanzione, the boss of technology firm Arris, which has expanded greatly under his stewardship.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517646</url>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>
      <date>1381964753</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Court hears bid to cancel Indian GP</title>

      <body>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday which is seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. The petition was filed on the grounds that the organisers have allegedly not paid taxes for a previous event. However, race organisers say the race will still go ahead. Indian motorsports chief Vicky Chandhok said: "The race will go on. There's absolutely no doubt about that. This has happened many times before." Chandhok, who heads the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, added: "You've had people trying to stop cricket matches - our justice system is pretty strong that no sporting event should be stopped. "It's a civil matter. Let it be heard in court as long as it takes and that's it. No worries." A spokesman for the circuit's owner, Jaypee Sports International Limited, said: "Whatever the court says, we are ready to follow." Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 90 points with 100 still available, could clinch his fourth title in India this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will triumph if he finishes fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The Supreme Court in India has executive powers and ordered circuit bosses two years ago to freeze 25% of ticket revenues until they had settled an outstanding tax dispute. That ruling followed Public Interest Litigation filed by campaigner Amit Kumar, the same man who is behind Thursday's petition. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is already uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <title>I'll step aside - Kilmarnock chairman</title>
      <description>Michael Johnston says he is willing to step down as chairman of Kilmarnock if the right investors can be found.</description>

      <body>Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston says he would step aside from his position if the right investors can be attracted to Rugby Park. Johnston has been under pressure from fans groups to leave the club and was the subject of more protests during Saturday's 2-0 win over Ross County. But he insisted to BBC Scotland that he is open to change. "I'm looking for more local business people to work in partnership for the benefit of the club," said Johnston. "Billy Bowie is the first person since the Moffat family to table an offer of finance." Johnston, who inherited the Scottish Premiership club from the Moffats, revealed that Ayrshire businessman Bowie had invested £200,000 in Kilmarnock, with a further £1.1m promised. The chairman believes he has more to achieve before leaving Kilmarnock and intends reducing debts of around £9m. However, he admitted that, if new investors offer the right money, he would consider his position. Johnston has held talks with the Kilmarnock Futures Consortium and the group is understood to be set to present its takeover plan to the Kilmarnock chairman shortly. Bowie is also believed to be open to working with the consortium headed up by Alan McLeish from the club's kit sponsor, QTS. The 2-0 victory over County was Kilmarnock's first of the season and the first for Allan Johnston, who was appointed manager in the summer. Supporters held up red cards in the 18th and 69th minutes, symbolic of when the club was founded in 1869, in protest at the chairman's running of the club. </body>

The company said on Wednesday it would have to close the plant after workers there rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions.

"By using Brent crude oil, the price of that crude coming into the plant for either chemicals or refining purposes - it is the most expensive crude that's out there, so Grangemouth faces a disadvantage in terms of crude oil relative to other refineries because of the higher price," he explained.

      <body>More than 1,000 people were killed when the Rana Plaza factory complex collapsed in Bangladesh in April. Six months after the accident one of the retailers whose clothes were being made there has confirmed it will be extending short-term aid for the families affected. Long-term compensation is still to be arranged, but Primark has said it will continue to pay the wages of all those affected, including those who were working for other companies, for another three months. The low-cost retailer - which has faced criticism for its cheap clothes made in places like Bangladesh - has been paying the salaries, which average about £24 per month, for the past six months.

      <title>The older workers who keep going</title>
      <description>'I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home'</description>

      <body>As his 80th birthday approached, Bob Hooker decided to slow down a little. Instead of eight hours a day of painting and decorating, he asked his son and business partner if he could cut down a little - to just seven hours a day. But when big jobs needed to be finished, he still finds himself putting in extra hours up his ladder to get it done. "I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home," he says. "I feel sorry for people that have to retire." And a growing number feel the same way. According to official figures, there are 32,000 people in the UK who are in their 80s and still hard at work, a figure that has increased by more than half in the past 10 years. And as the post-war baby boom generation reach their mid-60s, it's becoming increasingly common to work past what used to be the official retirement age. Just over one million people are still working past the age of 65, and 324,000 of those are 70 and over. There are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60. But better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead. Not everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though. For Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss. But for big employers, it's not so simple. The NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers. In England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday. It's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages. But would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions. The government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048. As a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates. But many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload. He loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire. "I do need the money," he says. "If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough." The self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do. Many of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want. But if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them. There are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want. And in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers after the state retirement age was abolished. But older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old. And many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years. It's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher. And if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker. For many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned. </body>

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever fly again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70641000/jpg/_70641820_183694639(1).jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns seven Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <title>Straw houses and other energy saving secrets</title>
      <description>Straw houses and other secrets of cutting energy bills</description>

      <body>What do an Australian accountant living in south-west London, a 65-year-old sheep farmer in Wales, and council tenants in a rural Lincolnshire district have in common? The answer is a passion for energy efficiency that means that they will not be hit as hard as most by the latest round of gas and electricity price rises. They have built or live in properties where the insulation drastically reduces the need for heat. "You have to plug the gaps, otherwise it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket," says Peter Urquhart, the Aussie who has created an eco home in North Cheam. His project is no grand design, but a two-bedroom, timber-framed bungalow which his neighbours refer to as "the shed". Close to completion in a suburban estate opposite a primary school, only the modern chimneys protruding from the slanting low-rise roof give any clue that this property is different. But inside, skylights mean the rooms are filled with natural light and there is a ventilation system which allows the stale air going out to heat the fresh air coming in. Solar panels lay flat against the roof, creating energy for the underfloor heating. "It is unusual, but it is a home at the end of the day," says 36-year-old Mr Urquhart. The project, he says, took a lot more time, energy and money than he expected. Yet, for him, the reward is displaying an example of what can be done. It is not, he admits, a template for every home in the UK. After all, not everyone has the opportunity to build from scratch, or has the finance to spend upfront. Yet, the Energy Saving Trust says there are small changes that people can make to their homes to make them more energy efficient, and cut bills. They include the use of energy saving lightbulbs, turning off unnecessary lights, setting the washing machine to 30C, or wrapping hot water tanks in decent insulation. Mr Urquhart's motivation was his concern for the environment - a view shared by his wife Lucy. The result is a property which, he estimates, has only a third of the energy needs of an equivalent Victorian home - and 40% of them are provided by the solar panels. The arrival of three-month-old daughter Molly means they have changed their plans to move in, so now they want to sell before embarking on a similar eco home project elsewhere. He is not the only one looking to mirror the design of an energy efficient property. Sheep farmer Anthony Porter has planning permission to build three cottages on his land in the historic county of Radnorshire in Wales. He built the first after reading about American settlers who, despite a shortage of timber, built homes that lasted for more than 100 years. Their, and his, choice of building material was bales of straw. With the price-lifting, profit-making energy industry being portrayed as the big bad wolf, the house made of straw may have worked after all. Lanterns, wind-up torches, a shower warmed by propane gas, and a wood-burning stove nullify the need for mains gas or electricity. The two-bedroom holiday cottage, nestled in idyllic countryside, was built during eight months of huff and puff by Mr Porter and a builder through the winter of 2012. Now it is hired by holiday-makers looking for a break from the gadgets and gizmos of modern life. Mr Porter says it is more fire resistant than a timber-framed house, and carries no greater insurance premium than a standard cottage. The walls are plastered with lime mortar and the roof space is insulated with sheep's wool, meaning the whole building, excluding the land and his own labour, cost Mr Porter £31,700. "It was quite a leap of faith," he admits. It was even more of a gamble for the councillors of North Kesteven in Lincolnshire to spend taxpayers' money on building the first straw bale social housing in the country in 2010. But, after looking at the figures, they were convinced it would pay off. The three-bedroom family homes each had a building budget of £110,000, which the council says is £20,000 less than a brick-built home of the same size. They also feature sheep's wool insulation, solar panels and triple glazing, resulting in an average saving of 44% in running costs, the council estimates. Critics of straw bale homes say that the thickness of the walls means there is less space in the house than with more standard walls. The need to keep them free of leaks and moisture is also vital. More significantly, most homeowners and tenants do not have the opportunity to bypass big energy bills in the same way, especially if they are living in draughty, Victorian homes. While these projects provide an advert for insulation, very few people have signed up to the Green Deal - a scheme in England, Wales and Scotland through which householders can borrow money to install double-glazing, loft insulation, and more efficient boilers. Enthusiasts of self-built homes argue that building a home from scratch means a range of energy efficient installations would be easier to include than in older homes. Self-build is a sector being encouraged by the government with tax breaks, despite the fact that those who want to build their own homes often complain of a shortage of land, planning difficulties, and a lack of mortgage products to finance the project. "With the lack of new homes being built at the moment, you would have thought more lenders would be offering self-build mortgages. Many of the banks and building societies quietly pulled out of the market citing a lack of demand for their mortgages," says Aaron Strutt, of mortgage brokers Trinity Financial. And there is an added irony. The energy companies are suggesting that government-imposed "green" levies are getting more expensive and are pushing up bills for consumers. There is little doubt that before a solution is reached, and before eco homes become less of a novelty, household energy costs will keep on rising. </body>

      <title>UFC fights for growing UK fan base</title>
      <description>How UFC mixed martial arts became respectable</description>

      <body>The latest in a series of US sporting exports goes under the spotlight in the UK this weekend, looking to build a fan base and television audience away from its spiritual home. But this is not the latest NFL game at Wembley, rather it is the equally bone-jarring mixed martial arts event in Manchester staged by the UFC, the leading promoter in a sport known in street vernacular as "cage fighting". Casino owner Lorenzo Fertitta and his brother Frank bought the UFC - the letters stand for Ultimate Fighting Championship - for $2m (£1.24m) back in 2001. Since then its value has soared and it now generates $500m a year in revenues. From being a sport with a limited TV audience, it is now shown in close to 150 countries, in 28 languages, and broadcast to one billion homes. But why did the brothers decide to buy into a sport that was on the ropes at the time? "It was a combination of business sense and love of sport. I thought it had good business potential," says Lorenzo, 44. He said that coming from Las Vegas, he had seen many great boxing bouts in a city dubbed Fight Town - from Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes, to the golden era of the late 1970s and early 1980s featuring Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran, and then into the Mike Tyson era. "But when I looked at boxing, I felt it was a broken business in many ways, with a short-term vision from a business perspective," Mr Fertitta says. It is a business that has been around for 100 years, makes millions in revenues, but has no real brand value, he adds. "Then we came across the UFC and felt there was value in the brand." He said that the UFC brand had transcended the sport it promotes - mixed martial arts - and that "by establishing regulations, and improving health and safety, we could really build something". "Combat sports are one of the few that can be transferred across a global stage," he adds. "Sometimes sports - cricket for example - just don't travel well. We take two world class athletes, and let them use the martial arts they want." After their purchase, the Fertittas regulated the sport, looked after the fighters, introduced marketing and sold TV rights. In the ring they eliminated the fouls that had caused US senator John McCain to once call it "human cockfighting" - including eye-gouging, groin attacks, and head-butting. "We took a step back, we knew we were dealing with a sport that had a controversial background," says Mr Fertitta. "We crafted rules and regulations. We looked at Olympic Games combat sports, and took the rules and regulations from Olympic boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, taekwondo, and judo. "That is our sport, a combination of those four. The Olympics defined our health and safety rules." He says that based on revenues and profitability, the UFC brand is now in the top echelon of global sports franchises, alongside the likes of Manchester United, the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees. Current big name sponsors include Gillette, Ford, PandG, and Disney. The UFC's core base of fans are males aged 18 to 34, but in some markets, notably Brazil, there is a strong female interest. He says the sport - helped by a strong social-media presence - is creating fans in a different demographic from boxing, which he says is increasingly seen as "your father's sport". UFC mixed martial arts has a healthy pay-TV audience in the US and Canada, and a growing viewership in Brazil, where many of the top fighters are from. In North America the UFC is now looking at establishing its own viewing channels. Whereas previous strategy has very much been aimed at the US, their global ambitions are now turned to Asia and Europe, with BT Sport signed up for regular TV programming in the UK. "Local programming in prime time - that will broaden audience access, and help us break through to our British fan base," says Mr Fertitta. To grow the sport, the UFC a year ago hired Gary Cook - the former chief executive of Manchester City football club - with responsibility for the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and whose brief includes getting more coverage on to primetime slots. He is also in the process of organising a series of European fights in major cities such as London, Berlin, Stockholm and Istanbul. Next year, a successful American gym business is also being exported to Europe, where people can practise different martial arts under one roof. There will be a tie-in UFC fitness DVD, and there are also high hopes for an EA computer game coming out early next year. Back in the US, there are a couple of flies in the ointment - the refusal of New York state to sanction the sport, and allegations by some fighters that they are not fairly paid. Mr Fertitta puts the New York impasse down to a dispute about union representation in his Las Vegas group Station Casinos spilling over into the New York legislative process. On fighter pay, he says: "You get paid for performance. You don't hear the guys who are successful complaining. We also have a vibrant 'middle class' of fighters - guys who will never be world champion, but still make a good living." Two of the top fighters competing in Manchester on Saturday, will be in the bout between American Mark Munoz and Brazilian Lyoto Machida, with the latter replacing injured UK fighter Michael Bisping. Mr Fertitta does not believe the British fighter's withdrawal will hit attendances at the Phones 4U Arena event. But he adds: "We don't just want to be another American sport that rolls in and rolls out again, we want to create a truly European sport, with homegrown talent for a homegrown audience." </body>

      <description>Ethiopia's hide industry bids to grow with UK help</description>

      <body>Amid the rhythmic clicking of rows and rows of sewing machines, hundreds of workers are busy creating a range of leather gloves, bags and jackets. "I can tell when employees' skills have improved by the noises of the machines speeding up," says Tsedenia Mekbib, a general manager. We are at a busy factory on the outskirts of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It is one of three such facilities in the city owned by UK leather goods company Pittards, which has a long history of operating in the country. While an increasing number of Western firms of all sizes are now looking at doing business in Africa, Pittards has had a 90-year head start. The company, which is based in Yeovil, Somerset, in the south-west of England, has been trading in Ethiopia since the 1920s. And it is all down to a celebrated type of sheep - the Ethiopian hair sheep. This breed, which does not grow a thick coat of wool, also has much thinner skin than its European brethren, making it ideal for delicate leather apparel such as ladies' gloves. Pittards now has ambitious plans to grow its Ethiopian operations, which help contribute towards the firm's £39m ($60m) annual revenues. At present its Addis Ababa-based factories and tannery to the south of the city employ about 1,200 locals, a number expected to grow to about 5,000 within five years. A fourth factory has already been built, and is waiting to be occupied. On the current production floors, an element of handwork is also included in the manufacturing process, which each month produces 100,000 work gloves and 5,000 dress gloves. Pittards' Ethiopian factories also produce two million sq feet (186,000 sq m) of quality leather for export to be made into garments ranging from specialist golf gloves to couture handbags. "Ethiopia will grow in importance to Pittards and the global leather industry [in general]," says the company's chief executive Reg Hankey. Ethiopia's attractions for Pittards, and other Western firms, include the country's large pool of relatively low-cost labour. It also has duty-free status for most manufactured products for export to Europe, the US and other countries. Despite Ethiopia having the largest flock of hair sheep in the world - more than 26 million - it is not the largest supplier of skins. Its flock's reproductive rate of about 37% trails New Zealand's 180% and means Ethiopia has only some 9.5 million sheepskins available annually compared with New Zealand's total of about 30 million. Better animal husbandry should increase Ethiopia's supply. Pittards is already involved in environmental programmes to improve the quality of local skins through improved husbandry and treatment against parasites. Another benefit could be improved meat yields, a not insignificant detail while Ethiopia remains a developing country. Regarding the wider issues of doing business in Ethiopia, Mr Hankey says the country faces the same challenges as other developing nations, encompassing difficulties related to bureaucracy, customs and banking. Yet, he adds, while more has to be done, the situation is greatly improved. "Ethiopia has come a very long way over the last 23 years since I first visited, and the last decade in particular has witnessed massive positive changes," Mr Hankey says. "Ethiopia has worked very hard to establish itself as a preferred country for economic development within Africa." Ethiopia's government now wants to grow its leather industry's annual exports to $500m by the completion of its five-year growth and transformation plan at the end of 2015. Leather exports stood at $123m last year. Within Pittards, the British management is happy to be playing a part in Ethiopia reaching its ambitious goal. "We have put down roots," Mr Hankey says. "This changes relationships and thinking - we see things from the inside and the outside, giving us a unique position for further development." Busy at work in the Pittards factory is 20-year-old Embret Beshada. Her job is to sew two glove-shaped panels together while incorporating material to create a thumb casing. She says she found the work easy when she started just over a year ago, despite having to learn many new skills, and was producing gloves within two months. "Being able to support myself excites me the most," she says. Sitting at sewing machines nearby are some of her friends. About 80% of the factory workforce is female, while at the tannery about 80% of the workforce is male. "We are seeing people get more jobs, and people's lifestyles changing, which gives us hope for the future," Ms Beshada adds. </body>

      <title>Why Grangemouth matters</title>
      <description>Why the Grangemouth plant matters to the UK</description>

      <body>Ineos says the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth is to close while the oil refinery will remain open. Around 800 jobs will be affected by the closure. In total Grangemouth employs 1,370 staff and a dispute between union members and staff remains unresolved. The loss of the petrochemicals plant is a major blow and now the focus will be on the refinery which is a key part of the Scottish and UK economy. The Grangemouth refinery supplies 70% of the fuel used at Scotland's filling stations and it also supplies fuel to Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. Grangemouth is an important employer and the 800 jobs lost by the closure of the petrochemicals plant are a big loss. Along with the refinery, Grangemouth employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the site. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the business is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth's refinery is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is due to close. </body>

      <title>'American nightmare' in Detroit</title>
      <description>What happens if Detroit cuts payments to pensioners?</description>

      <body>Three months ago, Detroit became the largest city to file for bankruptcy in US history. The trial to determine whether a city of Detroit's size can stop paying its bills will have huge potential repercussions for cities and states across the country. Perhaps no-one is awaiting the trial's outcome as much as Erma and Gordon MacDonald, who have been married for 63 years. "I'm smarter than her," jokes Mr MacDonald, 87. "Only a stupid person would agree to marry me." A jester at heart, Mr MacDonald says people always ask him why he laughs so much. Mrs MacDonald, 82, has an easy answer: "It's so we don't cry." In their tiny one-bedroom flat decorated with photos of their children and grandchildren, the MacDonalds grow silent. They contemplate a future in which the pension that Mr MacDonald earned over 39 years with the Detroit Police disappears - a potential casualty of Detroit's bankruptcy filing. "I don't know what else to say - we're up in the air," Mr MacDonald says. He worries more about his wife, who is in poor health, than about himself. "I take 15 prescriptions," says Mrs MacDonald, "and I kind of jokingly said if they take [my healthcare] away, which pills do I stop without dying?" While it might seem unfathomable that the MacDonalds could face such a choice, the reality is that if Detroit's bankruptcy filing is allowed to proceed, the city will face extremely difficult decisions. Kevyn Orr, the emergency manager brought in to run the city by the state of Michigan, argues there is no way forward for Detroit other than through the fresh financial start that bankruptcy brings. The city is anywhere from $18bn (£11bn) to $20bn in debt - with $9bn a result of ballooning pension and healthcare costs. It has already cut basic services to the bone, pushing more residents to flee. The city's population now stands at 700,000, down from two million at Detroit's peak. Wait times for emergency calls now top one hour, and less than a third of the streetlights function. More than 80,000 properties have been abandoned. Nature, it seems, moves faster than federal court. Despite all the hardship, those representing the city's pension schemes say a bankruptcy filing would allow the city to renege on promises made long ago. They dispute Mr Orr's calculations, and say it's unfair that the 23,500 retirees who spent their lives working to keep Detroit safe and clean could be left with nothing. "They're taking away the American dream and turning it into the American nightmare," says Donald Hall, who spent 29 years as a detention centre officer and now depends on the $850 he receives from the city every month. There's no question that Detroit is unique among US cities, to fly so high and fall so far, to build landmarks like the majestic Michigan Central Station that less than a hundred years later have the aura of Roman ruins. So then what impact, if any, could a successful bankruptcy filing have on other cities? "On the one hand, Detroit is in an unusual position because it has had massive depopulation coupled with a collapse of the industrial sector," says University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, an expert in bankruptcy law. "On the other hand, Detroit was not alone in making legal commitments to people which it had no funding for." According to a study by economists at Northwestern University, cities and counties across the US have a total of $574bn in unfunded pension obligations. Already, cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and San Diego, California, have shown signs they are crumbling under the weight of the financial promises made to retirees. "If Detroit is able to file for bankruptcy, then every other big city is going to be watching this," says Prof Pottow. James Canty is a lifelong Detroit resident and manager of the city's parking department. I followed him on his daily rounds as he tried to rid the city of some of the thousands of abandoned cars that line its streets. The job was once done by the police. Now, Mr Canty's team has taken on the role of enforcer in an attempt to free up overworked officers. In neighbourhoods where it's hard to tell which, if any, of the houses are occupied, Mr Canty points to a white Chevrolet sedan with shattered windows here, a pick-up truck missing a wheel there. Frequently, as soon as a tow truck arrives to remove the offending vehicle, the vehicle's owner suddenly appears, as if by magic. The excuses are often similar - what looks like a derelict car is in fact in the process of being mended. It's not hard to see Detroit's financial position in the same way as these dented and decrepit cars - they may or may not be broken, depending on who is looking at them. Is it better to clear the way for something new - or to be forced to fix what only appears beyond repair? </body>

      <description>The Chinese boss who had a novel approach to quality control</description>

      <body>I will never forget my first encounter with the Chinese business leader Zhang Ruimin almost 10 years ago. There, in a glass case in the boardroom of his company Haier was a sledgehammer, not something you normally encounter in corporate surroundings. But Mr Zhang is no ordinary chief executive, as I was reminded in another meeting a month or two ago in his now rather more elaborate headquarters in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The sledgehammer has been removed to the new corporate museum, something that Chinese businesses are very keen on. But though the story has been frequently told, it is still a good way to explain the remarkable company Zhang Ruimin has created over the past 28 years. The Qingdao Refrigerator Plant was close to failure when Mr Zhang was sent in at the end of 1984. Production at the time was at a low ebb, and there was no money to pay the staff. Mr Zhang borrowed some cash from a countryside workers' co-operative, and set about seeing what could be done about the disastrous state of the company his municipal employers had sent him into. Early notices (now on display in the company museum) banned urination and defecation in the factory. Pretty soon Mr Zhang was confronted with complaints from fridge buyers. In response, he gathered the workers in a yard outside the plant, and in front of them 76 substandard fridges were smashed to pieces. A quality quest to revive the plant started from that symbolic sledgehammer attack. And it worked. Qingdao has historic links with Germany; the city's Tsingtao beer - originally brewed by German expats - is now sold all over the world. So echoing its German partner Leibherr, the fridge business adopted a new name - Haier. Then began a remarkable expansion which has turned it into one of the few current Chinese global brands. With 80,000 employees across the globe, it is now one of the biggest manufacturers of white goods in the world. And when you listen to Zhang Ruimin talking about what he has done, you begin to realise that this is not just a dramatic story about a sledgehammer approach to corporate quality. Using a canny blend of Western management thinking and ancient Eastern ideas, Mr Zhang has created a management philosophy which is deep-seated and far-seeing. At first sight, it might seem to be management jargon plus Confucius, Taoism and Sun Tzu's Art of War all jumbled up. But Mr Zhang has developed some potent insights of his own into how a company might evolve in the face of huge new global challenges. And he is still developing them. "I believe in getting the best of both worlds, both from Chinese culture and from the West," says Mr Zhang. "The good thing about Chinese culture is that it treats something as a whole system, the forest not just the trees. You can see this in the difference of approach of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. "Western medicine treats symptoms; traditional Chinese medicine treats the whole body, holistically. Western culture wants everything quantified... so we have also adopted some Western management concepts." "Last week, I was talking to a marketing guru in the US and he told me, 'Good companies meet demands, great companies create demands.' We want to be a great company." Zhang Ruimin set out for me the evolution of his management ideas. "In the 1980s we mostly learned from Japanese companies," he says. "In the 1990s, we learned from American companies: General Electric's Six Sigma insistence on quality, for example. "But now we have incorporated many of those best practices into building our own innovative business model. It's called the win-win model, aligning employee goals with user needs." So (for example) Haier is trying to use the internet to put customers in touch with the people who make the goods, and workers in touch with the product-people who design them. But doing this is hard work. "We're still in a trial and error period and we're still exploring new models," says Mr Zhang. "In the past we had examples to follow but now we are in uncharted territory." Zhang Ruimin calls this "management without leaders". Workers are supposed to be led by the consumers of the things they make. He adds: "The most difficult thing is that in the past the employees would listen to their bosses, but now they don't have any bosses they have to listen to the users." To make this practical, Haier has broken down its 80,000 workforce into hundreds of internal micro companies, each with a profit and loss account even when they are only supplying internal corporate customers. Employees with a good idea are encouraged to find a team to develop it and get it made. Another striking Haier innovation is "catfish management". In fact it's an acknowledgement that there are still leaders even in a so-called leaderless organisation. They may be a bit paranoid, though. It's explained like this: in the sea, a lone catfish creates a commotion when it swims near a school of other fish. Live salmon are transported to market with a catfish in the tank, to keep them active and lively. Haier gives each of its many division bosses a "catfish" shadow manager, who is poised to take over if the man or woman in charge falters. Three months of missed targets, and the catfish deposes the leaders he or she has been shadowing. Sounds ruthless, but the manager (of air conditioners) who I heard from thought it reasonable and even stimulating. Not sure whether Mr Zhang has a catfish, though. When Zhang Ruimin was busy creating waves at Haier in the 1980s and '90s, the great Chinese industrial revolution was changing the whole global landscape. The country was becoming the industrial production house for the world. But most new Chinese companies were making things ordered, devised and designed by Western companies. They made what other people wanted from them. Haier wanted to export its own goods itself... quite a different philosophy, though fridges and washing machines were not exactly state of the art technology. Something else stands out about Haier's export strategy: the company started off in the developed, tough Western markets - Germany, the USA. Mr Zhang says: "Most Chinese companies would choose the other way, the easy markets first and then the more difficult ones later. Many of them started with Africa and South East Asia because those markets had lower expectations of quality. "But we decided to enter the German market first, and people thought we were crazy. "But we tried an experiment. We said, 'Let's put German products and Haier products together and take out the brand and let people see which one is the worst... we hoped it wasn't us.' "We wanted to set the standards high and thus force us to solve all the problems and to meet those high standards. "The Chinese people say, 'If you want to play chess, you need to play it with the master,' because that's the only way you learn." </body>
