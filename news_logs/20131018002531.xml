      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>The body responsible for amateur boxing in Wales is "not fit for purpose" and "does not qualify for public funding", an independent audit report says. The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: "It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. "Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. "We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money." In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over £190,000 - more than double its £89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: "Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. "Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level." The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to "improve the culture at WABA", and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: "Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible." He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were "simply not acceptable". Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: "In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations." </body>

      <title>Ex-mayor denies ball-bearing blast</title>
      <description>A former mayor tells a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in his home town earlier this year which included a home-made ball-bearing bomb.</description>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor has told a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in the town. The incidents culminated in a home-made bomb being detonated under a car, scattering ball-bearings and shrapnel. John Larsen told Caernarfon Crown Court that he had played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. The 46-year-old denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. During his trial, the prosecution has claimed that there was "a strong compelling case" that Mr Larsen was the man behind the booms and blasts heard and seen in the area. One witness described how she had seen the town councillor near cars just before an explosion detonated under a Land Rover car. The blast showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident even found that one of the ball-bearings had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert told the court earlier that the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped on to the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury of even death to any passersby. But addressing Mr Larsen, his defence barrister, Gordon Hennell asked him: "Did you ever use any ball-bearings as shrapnel in a device?" "No, never," replied Mr Larsen, who had been the mayor of Denbigh in 1999. Mr Larsen told the jury that he had an interest in fireworks as one of his hobbies, alongside magic tricks. He also accepted that he had experimented with fuels for rockets. But Mr Hennell said the allegations against the defendant went further than experimentation. "The suggestion is that on March 24 you have not simply experimented, but set off an explosive device which has got ball-bearings added," he said. Larsen maintained: "No, that's incorrect. I didn't do that." Asked bluntly whether he had played any part in the night-time explosions in the Lenten Pool area, the defendant replied: "No, not at all." He told the jury that he had been at home in bed when the blasts occurred except for "a few occasions", and that he only went out late at night to check his wife's car. "It gets very rowdy at night," he added. Cross-examined by prosecution barrister, Wyn Lloyd Jones, the defendant again denied being involved in the incidents in Lenten Pool. Asked whether he wanted to distance himself "from the sheer horror of what you did", Mr Larsen replied: "No." The prosecutor said all the components for the device were in his home. But Mr Larsen described it as "standard firework material". Mr Lloyd Jones suggested the items had nothing to do with magic tricks and children's entertainment. He said Mr Larsen's interest in fireworks "became a lot more sinister." The defendant declared :"No, it didn't." Mr Larsen was arrested on 19 April 2013, and police found a mix of chemicals, modified fireworks, rockets, flares and a book on pyrotechnics at his home. He denies causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on March 24. He also denies three charges of arson in which cars were damaged, and possessing an explosive substance. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>Police have arrested 46 suspected drug dealers as part of a joint operation to reduce crime in Cardiff. The arrests come after a six-month undercover operation targeting dealers supplying Class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine in five areas. Detectives were alerted to concerns about dealing in Roath, Cathays, the city centre, Riverside and Grangetown. In three weeks, 40 men, four women and two juveniles aged between 16-55 were arrested as part of Operation Foxtrot. The arrests were across Cardiff in connection with more than 200 drug offences. A fifth woman has also been arrested for possession of CS spray. Operation Foxtrot has involved a partnership between South Wales Police, Cardiff Council and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Brown said: "Operation Foxtrot is a partnership approach to tackling drugs in our communities. "This means taking drugs off our street, putting the dealers in prison, cleaning areas where drug deals have taken place, and providing support to drug users. "During this operation we have witnessed drugs being sold openly on our streets, in parks and in subways, which quite simply will not be tolerated. "This operation is nothing more than the good people of Cardiff deserve." Anyone with information on the supply of drugs is asked to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, South Wales Police on 101, or their local officer whose contact details can be found on www.ourbobby.com </body>

      <title>School pupils offered TB screening</title>
      <description>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.</description>

      <body>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection. Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday. Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low. Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff. They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient. Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics. "We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said. "Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB." Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school. "Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added. TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected. People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs. The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained. Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night. Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47. </body>

      <title>Patient 'denied' chance to survive</title>

      <body>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog. Public Services Ombudsman Peter Tyndall upheld a complaint by the family of Carl Nolan, 30, of Rhyl, who had congenital cirrhosis of the liver. Mr Nolan had been treated at Glan Clwyd hospital. Health bosses said required standards were not met but changes had been made. The ombudsman's report, which refers to Mr Nolan as Mr X, said he was born with cirrhosis of the liver and diagnosed with the "life-threatening" condition - which replaces healthy tissue with non-functioning scar tissue - in 2000 but neither he nor his family were told at the time. And although a follow-up outpatient appointment was made for him in 2001 the IT worker was not notified, said the report. He became ill again in 2008 and was given treatment but investigations to determine the cause were not concluded. It was not until he requested a second opinion that he was told he had been born with cirrhosis. The report was not able to establish why Mr Nolan had not been initially told of his condition or given advice about how he could make lifestyle changes to improve his health after diagnosis of the condition. In 2010, he was admitted to hospital several times in quick succession after becoming ill again and blood tests showed that "his liver was failing". But the hospital "sent him away, only finally admitting him three days after his appearance" with a serious infection and before finally being referred for specialist treatment. He died seven weeks later. The report said: "Had he been treated three days earlier, Mr X should have recovered from the infection and had a chance of receiving a liver transplant. This opportunity to survive and flourish was denied him." In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Tyndall said: "If he had been appropriately and promptly treated, his family are left with the knowledge that he could still be with us today. "He was a young man with his life ahead of him, a partner, a loving family, and all that was taken away. "I was shocked by what our investigation found in this instance. "This is one of the worst examples of poor treatment and poor communication with a patient that I have encountered in my time as ombudsman." He upheld the family's complaint and issued recommendations to hospital manager Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to review its "care pathway" and appointments system as well as its complaints handling process. Mr Nolan's mother Pat, a call centre supervisor, said had he been advised about his diagnosis in 2001 he could have sought and received specialist help and advice to improve his condition and could, ultimately, be alive today had he been able to receive a liver transplant. Mrs Nolan said: "This is a catalogue of errors and everybody along the line is accountable for Carl's death because they knew what he had and no one saw fit to communicate that and act upon it. "I don't know what their procedures are but something is very lax." Angela Hopkins, health board executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services, said: "The health board recognises that some of the care given was below the standard that should have been provided to the patient and family. "We fully accept the recommendations in the report and have taken action to address each one made. "We are reviewing our appointment system and process and gastroenterology care pathways to provide an improved and more robust safe service for patients. "We are also making sure that safeguard measures are implemented to improve our standards of engagement with patients while they are treated by the health service in north Wales." The ombudsman also recommended that £5,000 be paid to the family to acknowledge the "failings and provide financial redress" along with £500 for its "poor complaint handling". The report said the family wanted changes to ensure the same "mistakes are never repeated". The ombudsman can hold the institution to account but not individuals involved in the care of Mr Nolan. Hs mother has written to the General Medical Council which regulates doctors and the medical profession asking that her son's case is reviewed. "As far as I can see they seem to be above the law and not answerable to anybody and it has got to stop," she said. </body>

      <title>Anglo-French Cup will fail - Gatland</title>
      <description>Wales coach Warren Gatland believes the Anglo-French breakaway from the Heineken Cup is destined to fail.</description>

      <body>Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned that English and French clubs' attempts to set up a breakaway tournament from the Heineken Cup will fail. The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next season, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with Heineken Cup qualification and revenue sharing. "I don't see an Anglo-French competition being successful or lasting that long," Gatland told BBC Jersey. "I think all parties want full representation from all the countries." The new tournament could yet include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's (IRB) endorsement. New Zealander Gatland, who was appointed to the Wales post in 2008 after spells with London Wasps and Connacht as well as Ireland, believes a tournament that includes only English and French clubs will damage the international game in the northern hemisphere. "There needs to be some sort of protection for a Scottish or Italian team potentially," he added. "Without their involvement we could see an impact going into the Six Nations." The 50-year-old also believes that plans for the Rugby Champions Cup may have overlooked difficulties in securing officials for matches. The English Rugby Football Union (RFU) are still uncommitted to the new tournament and their French counterparts actively oppose it. "The referees are controlled by the unions and France have said they would not support a new competition, while the RFU have sort of stood on the fence," Gatland added. Quentin Smith, the chairman of England's top-level Premiership, and Tim Lopez, agent to the likes of Wales and Cardiff full-back Leigh Halfpenny, have warned that the uncertainty over top-level European rugby is affecting players' decisions over contracts at Welsh regions. </body>

All the animals were found mauled and dismembered in Gwernllwyn Terrace, Tylorstown, over an eight week period, the RSPCA said. The last animal was reported dead to the RSPCA on 30 September. The charity said the cats may have been killed by a dog and has appealed for witnesses to come forward. RSPCA inspector Selina Chan said: "This is a very distressing report and must have been incredibly upsetting for the owners to find their pets like this. "It's vital that anyone who knows anything about this horrible incident comes and talk to us in confidence. "It is likely that the animal responsible for these death is probably a large dog, but we need more information before we can take this any further." </body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown. There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year. The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades". The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995. However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled. The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police. The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded. An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year. Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats. The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen. Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year. The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family. "But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity. "While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable." While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges". He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels. "While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online." Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling. "This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public. "England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues." The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales. </body>

      <description>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies says.</description>

      <body>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader has suggested. In a speech, Andrew RT Davies will say the BBC has a "near monopoly" on reporting devolution and should be scrutinised by Welsh politicians. This, he will say, will make senior management and editors accountable for the actions they and their teams take. UK ministers said there was a "net benefit" to all parts of the United Kingdom in not devolving broadcasting. Neither AMs or the Welsh government currently have functions relating to broadcasting. The BBC Trust is a UK wide body to oversee the BBC, although there is an Audience Council in Wales which "scrutinises the BBC's services on behalf of BBC audiences in Wales". Mr Davies will tell an audience in Aberystwyth: "The editorial decisions that are taken in Wales not just on politics but on how Wales is reported must be scrutinised by the most important democratically elected body in Wales." He also warns the BBC's ability to "extend its reach in news" through online services is "perhaps to the detriment of other news outlets who usually need advertising revenues or online charging schemes to pay for anywhere near like for like presence". "In the Welsh context, it is near on impossible for a competitor to emerge because of the dominance of the BBC's website - it is free, extensive and accessible on portable devices." Mr Davies has written to Culture Secretary Maria Miller to argue that the future governance of the BBC in Wales should be considered during the charter renewal process in 2017. However, this call from Mr Davies is at odds with the current position of the UK government. In its submission to the second part of the Silk Commission considering further powers for the assembly, the Wales Office said: "There are good reasons why broadcasting was not devolved in the devolution settlements and there is no evidence to suggest that devolution of broadcasting policy or a different approach to funding the BBC would benefit licence fee payers. "There is a greater net benefit to the nation and all its constituent parts in having broadcasting reserved." A spokesman for the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport restated this position on Wednesday, saying Mr Davies's suggestion was not being considered. In a statement the BBC Trust said: "The BBC is accountable to licence fee payers across the UK through the BBC Trust. "In Wales, the national trustee Elan Closs Stephens represents the interests of Welsh licence fee payers and the trust is advised about the BBC's performance by the Audience Council Wales. "The Welsh assembly is involved in the process of appointing the national trustee." In a separate submission to the commission, the Welsh Conservative assembly group agreed key decisions on broadcasting in Wales should remain the responsibility of UK ministers. But the document also called for a "mechanism of joint accountability" to both the assembly and the UK parliament, so devolved matters such as the Welsh language could be addressed better. Mr Davies will also call for an end to the block grant system, by which the UK Treasury funds the Welsh government, where he says "a cheque is sent down the M4 and simply cashed, and usually more demanded on top". On Wednesday the prime minister refused to say when new tax and borrowing powers, recommended by the first part of the Silk Commission, would be implemented in Wales. In his speech Mr Davies will acknowledge David Cameron's view that those involved in politics in Cardiff Bay are "obsessed with constitutional tinkering" but blame a "poor" original devolution settlement that has left many policy makers discussing the constitution rather than policy. </body>

      <body>Gold coins and bars worth about £30,000 have been stolen from a flat in Pyle, Bridgend. They were taken some time between 16:00 BST Sunday, 13 October, and 14:00 BST the following Tuesday. The fifteen 1oz coins and bars were kept in a maroon velvet draw string bag which police believe may have been discarded by the burglar. Anyone with information can call South Wales Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Det Sgt Paul Mason said: "The property stolen is very distinctive.

      <body>A grandfather is to net £125,000 after he placed a £50 bet on his grandson playing football for Wales - when he was 18 months old. Sixteen-year-old Harry Wilson made his international debut on Tuesday as a substitute against Belgium, becoming Wales' youngest ever senior player. His grandfather Peter Edwards, 62, was quoted odds of 2,500/1 when he placed the bet with a bookmaker in Wrexham. He is now set to retire a year earlier than originally planned. Wrexham-born Wilson came on in the 87th minute during Wales' 1-1 draw. At 16 years and 207 days, the Liverpool midfielder was 108 days younger than previous record holder Gareth Bale, now the world's most expensive footballer following his recent move to Real Madrid. There had been speculation that England were ready to try to persuade Wilson to switch international allegiance, but he opted for Wales. Mr Edwards explained how he felt when Wilson made his appearance. "I was shattered because I had to wait for 85, 86 minutes before he came on and I was panicking because they'd already substituted twice, so I thought he wasn't going to make it," he said. "But when he came on I had another glass of wine. (I was) a proud granddad first for sure. "I told my wife at half-time that my pulse was 106 - I didn't know whether that was good or bad." Mr Edwards said Wilson had showed an interest in football from a young age. "When he was about 18 months old he used to chase a ball around on the carpet before he could walk," Mr Edwards said. "I went into William Hill in Wrexham and asked them how I go about it. I had no idea how to do it and the manageress put me in touch with London." Electrical contractor Mr Edwards, of Corwen, Denbighshire, works away from home most of the year, spending one weekend a fortnight with wife Dorothy, 58. "She is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back," said Mr Edwards. "I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet." He said after Harry enrolled in the Liverpool FC academy his skills quickly developed and he returned to William Hill in the hope of placing a second bet. "Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill," he added. </body>

      <body>Carved wooden panels presented by Queen Victoria have been stolen from Kinmel Hall near Abergele in Conwy. The monarch is believe to have stayed at the hall in 1870. North Wales Police said the panels which were attached to a mantle above a fireplace were taken during a recent break-in. Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting reference RC13168889. "These are of significant historical value and were presented to the hall by Queen Victoria," said PC Ian Condon from North Wales Police. "The frames were attached to a mantle above a fire place, and have been ripped from their surrounding and removed from the building." Last year plans were revealed to turn the mansion, dubbed the "Welsh Versailles", into a hotel. The 122-room mansion had been acquired by an unnamed buyer after being put up for auction. </body>

      <body>A wheat bag left to warm too long in a microwave is believed to have caused a fire in a 93-year-old woman's flat at a Conwy sheltered housing complex. The pensioner and two other people were taken to hospital and about 30 to 40 other residents were evacuated from flats at Rhoslan Park in Colwyn Bay. The blaze broke out at about 04:00 BST on Thursday. The Welsh Ambulance Service said the woman has been treated for smoke inhalation. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said she had been alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm and was given safety advice over the phone from fire control operators while help was mobilised. Police and ambulance staff were also called and the pensioner was led to safety to be treated by paramedics at the scene. She was then transferred to hospital as a precaution. The fire service said that other residents from the building, also as a precaution, and were safely accounted for. Two others were treated at the scene and transferred to hospital. Gwyn Jones from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted that the smoke alarm had been activated. "This alarm proved invaluable as it gave us an early warning that there was a problem at the address and enabled emergency services to respond quickly," he said. "It appears that a wheat bag left to re-heat for too long caused the fire and we are warning residents throughout north Wales who have any kind of warming device such as this to ensure that they follow the manufacturer's instructions. "We also advise not to leave any cooking unattended." </body>

      <title>Councils' cash falls by average 3.5%</title>
      <description>Councils in Wales will have their Welsh government funding cut by between 4.6 and 1.2% next year, ministers have announced.</description>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls. It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country. The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population. Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations. Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils. The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS. Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months. Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn. She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging". The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources. "I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said. "For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households." Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that. "I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me. "I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then." She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week. Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions. She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind. Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending. "The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services. "Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways. The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions". It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services. WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years. "Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised." BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes: It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%. Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before. Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups. They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax. The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money. Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements. A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February. BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes: Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze. Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work. It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that. Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions. But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down. Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council. Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce. But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency. The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private. While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities. Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services. Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations. The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties. Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks. It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples. Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do. Their track record though is far from convincing. In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments. The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well". If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards. Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged. Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations. BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes: The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities. The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund. Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru. Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13. Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment. Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer. </body>

      <body>A dairy company has announced plans to close a Wrexham creamery with the possible loss of 231 jobs. First Milk has told staff its cheese-packing plant in Maelor could close by the end of May 2014. The firm has lost a "significant" contract with Asda and said it had informed trade unions. It will begin a staff consultation soon. The Welsh government said it was "disappointing news" and it would be meeting urgently with First Milk. A spokesman said all possible options would be examined "to try to safeguard the future of the packing facility and the jobs at Maelor". Welsh Secretary David Jones said it was a "sobering reminder of the challenges the Welsh economy still faces". "The news that there may be a significant number of job losses at the First Milk site in Wrexham will cause a great deal of concern to the workers, families and communities affected," he added. "The Wales Office is in close communication with the company and we are committed to working with the Welsh government to offer all the support we can at this difficult time." In a statement, First Milk - a co-operative owned by farmers across the UK - said it was "no longer economically viable for the business to keep the site at Maelor operational". A spokesman added: "We very much regret the need to make the proposal to close our Maelor operation. "We have a hard-working, loyal and committed workforce there and we are aware of the impact that this news will have on them. "We will of course seek to provide those potentially affected with every support and address ways in which the impact of the proposals can be reduced." The spokesman added: "As a farmer-owned co-operative, the reason we're here is to deliver sustainable returns to our members and this announcement today supports that objective." Clwyd South AM Ken Skates said: "This announcement will devastate First Milk's loyal and hard-working employees and is a major blow for the local area. "I am disappointed to see Asda end their contract with the company after the excellent service they have been shown by the workers over the years." In a statement, Asda said: "Unfortunately as part of a long-term strategic review, we have decided that from April 2014 we will be switching the supply of some of our cheese from First Milk to Arla. "We appreciate how disappointing this news will be for them but we want to reassure everyone that this decision was not taken lightly." Wrexham council leader Neil Rogers said it was a "sad day for Wrexham". He added: "Our thoughts are with those employees who are to be made redundant and their families. "It is important that Wrexham does everything it can to develop its economy by attracting new businesses into the county borough." Last year, First Milk announced £13.5m redevelopment plans which it said would safeguard 220 jobs. The firm said it needed to invest in new production facilities at the Maelor creamery to remain competitive. Wrexham councillors approved plans for the company to build a new cheese-cutting and packing centre, including offices. </body>

      <body>An explosive device that was set off in a Denbighshire town could have led to serious injury or death, an explosives expert has told Caernarfon Crown Court. The improvised bomb was detonated in Lenten Pool, Denbigh, in March, smashing windows and scattering shrapnel and metal ball bearings. Former town mayor John Larsen denies being responsible for the blast and a series of arson attacks on cars. He also denies two charges of possessing explosives. Forensic scientist Kevin Sanders told the jury he examined the remains of the device that went off at Lenten Pool on 24 March. Metal fragments from the device were found "twisted and had sharp edges". They were also covered in a grey sooty residue, which was "consistent with being in close proximity to an explosion," Mr Sanders said. The jury heard the fragments had come from a drinks or food can, and had probably held a chlorate-based explosive. The expert said those type of explosive chemicals were not normally used in commercially-made fireworks, and it would be a "home-made" explosive. The court also heard ball-bearings found scattered around the area had either been in the can-bomb or strapped to it. One of those ball-bearings smashed a nearby bedroom window and hit a bed headboard. "They would have been ejected (by the blast) at several hundred metres per second," said Mr Sanders. "If anyone had been passing they would have been likely to have caused serious injury. "If it hit in the head it could have caused death." The trial has heard that the blast in March was the culmination of weeks of bangs and blasts in the Lenten Pool area, that had left some residents "terrified". Mr Larsen, who is a town councillor and had been a mayor of Denbigh in 1999, was arrested at his nearby home on 19 April. A search of his home recovered a wide-range of chemicals, modified fireworks, ball-bearings, flares, and a book on pyrotechnics. The jury has been told it is part of Mr Larsen's defence that he had an innocent and legitimate interest in fireworks. The trial was told many of the chemicals found in his home could be used to make gunpowder and firework flash-powder. There were also components used to colour fireworks, and fuse wires to ignite them. The defence case is due to start on Wednesday, when Mr Larsen is expected to give evidence. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards. Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading. It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable". It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings. The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town. Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years. Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately. The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known. It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building. A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building. "We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided." </body>

      <body>One of Powys's largest private sector employers has announced it is creating 50 new jobs. Packaging Coordinators Inc (PCI) in Hay-on-Wye, which supplies the pharmaceutical industry with packaging, already employs around 300 staff in the town. The firm said it was looking to employ the 50 workers over the next six months. It follows the recruitment of 40 new employees since April. PCI, formally known as AndersonBrecon UK, said it was "very keen to attract local talent". Hywel Lucas, PCI's director of human resources and organisation development, said: "With the company looking to develop further, now is a great time to join PCI. "We are very keen to attract local talent and welcome applications from anybody who feels they have the ambition to work for a successful company on an upward trajectory." He said the jobs included packaging operations, quality assurance, engineering and project management.

      <body>Water pipes in Welshpool are being replaced after a "flurry" of bursts cut supplies to residents and a hospital. A £250,000 project is renewing about 300m (330 yards) of pipes in Gungrog Road, near Victoria Memorial Hospital. A one-way system will be in place and Severn Trent Water has apologised for any disruption. It is hoped the new pipes will be working by next month. Last month, some homes were temporarily without water and the hospital lost its supply twice in three days. The hospital's new kidney dialysis unit needs 1,200 litres of water every hour when running at full capacity. Severn Trent said it expected the renewed pipes to be working by the end of November. Dave Kiernan, the firm's programme manager, said: "The water pipes in Gungrog Road have served the local community for a very long time. "Their age and the increased demand for water has led to the recent bursts, causing interruptions to our customers' water supply and the service we provide." He said the work had been planned as part of a bigger project but was being brought forward because of a flurry of problems experienced at the hospital and Gungrog Infants School. The company said most of the work outside the school was planned for half term week to "minimise disruption". </body>

      <body>Scarlets tight-head prop Samson Lee has been banned for two weeks following the incident that led to his sin-binning in their 33-26 win at Harlequins last weekend. Lee's boot struck Quins scrum-half Danny Care's face at a ruck. Uncapped 20-year-old Lee was banned until Monday, 28 October. That rules him out of the Scarlets' Heineken Cup clash against Racing Metro on Saturday and the 25 October Pro12 clash at Zebre. French citing commissioner Jean-Claude Legendre referred the incident to the competition's disciplinary officials. Irish referee John Lacey sin-binned Lee and the player's case was considered by Scottish judicial officer Rod McKenzie. McKenzie determined Lee was going for the ball, but in doing so, the player's boot "made contact with Care's face in a reckless manner, and that in his opinion, the offence warranted a red card". An ERC statement read: "He [McKenzie] found that the act was at the low-end entry point of the IRB's [International Rugby Board's] sanctioning regime [two weeks] and although there were no aggravating factors, and although Lee had a clean record, the player had pleaded not guilty and therefore, no mitigation was possible in this case." The IRB recommended minimum sanctions for foul play are two weeks for a low range offence, five weeks for a mid range, and nine to 52 weeks for a high end. </body>

      <body>A number of Premier League clubs are introducing reciprocal deals to reduce the price of tickets for away fans. Newcastle United have agreed deals with West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City, while the Welsh club have a further agreement in place with Hull City. Magpies finance director John Irving said: "We believe the right way to encourage people to attend is to look at charging reasonable prices." Premier League clubs were each given £200,000 to subsidise travelling fans. Swansea fans will pay a reduced price of £20 for adults and £5 for concessions at Hull and Newcastle, with the same prices in place for the return fixtures at the Liberty Stadium. Travelling supporters from Newcastle and West Brom will both pay £15 for adults and £5 for concessions when their teams face each other. Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen hopes more agreements can be made. "I'm glad to see that things have slowly started to gather pace," he said. "We are in constant dialogue with other clubs in the Premier League and hope to announce additional reciprocal deals over the course of the campaign. "We are determined to help keep the costs down for travelling supporters; not just for our own loyal fans, but those supporters of other clubs around the country as well." Away attendances have declined by 10% over the past five seasons and the Football Supporters' Federation  has said the cost of tickets is a major concern. A 2013 BBC study of the costs of football found the average prices of the most expensive season ticket and highest and lowest match-day prices in the Premier League had fallen by up to 5.3%. </body>

      <body>Thieves have taken a haul of "irreplaceable" rugby shirts from a rugby club which has been hit by a spate of break-ins. A number nine jersey donated to Maesteg Rugby Club, near Bridgend, by former international Rob Howley was among the stolen memorabilia. The thieves also stole a rugby league shirt worn by veteran Kevin Ellis. South Wales Police are investigating the break-ins and officers have not ruled out a link between the three. The burglaries are the latest misfortune to hit the club. Memorabilia was destroyed in an arson attack on the main clubhouse in August shortly after it had been refurbished. The clubhouse's first-floor members' lounge was partially destroyed and other areas of the building suffered smoke and water damage. The property's electrical system was badly damaged, as was its cellar and steelwork on the stadium's stand. The main clubhouse building was targeted on Saturday and Sunday when a quantity of alcohol and confectionery was stolen. In the third burglary, thieves forced their way into the building some time between Monday afternoon and early Tuesday morning and took the rugby shirts. "The Rob Howley shirt in particular would hold a reasonable value for the thieves," said PC Viv Price. "The shirts are irreplaceable and mean a great deal to the club and its members. "I am appealing to anyone who may be offered any of these jerseys for sale or has any relevant information to come forward." Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. </body>

      <title>Bellamy admits emotional retirement</title>
      <description>Wales midfielder Craig Bellamy admits it was an emotional end to his international career after the 1-1 draw in Belgium.</description>

      <body>Craig Bellamy bowed out of international football admitting it was an emotional finish to his 78-cap Wales career. The 34-year-old, who scored 19 goals during 15 years as an international, played in Tuesday night's 1-1 draw in Belgium. He revealed the Welsh national anthem brought home his retirement. "You do think: 'This is probably the last time I'm going to be in this position as a player,'" said Bellamy. "To soak in your national anthem. I'm speechless about it, but it is really nice. It's something I do cherish. "It did hit home a bit that I'm not going to be this side of it again. "I've enjoyed every second of it. To reach 78 [caps] and the injuries I've had down the years. I'm delighted." Bellamy did question whether it was right to have given 16-year-old Harry Wilson his debut on Tuesday and prevent England having claims on him. The Liverpool Academy midfielder came on in the 87th minute against Belgium to become Wales' youngest ever player. "Sixteen is young. He can't play for anyone else now. Is that really the most important thing? "I think he's a talent and I think he's going to do well in the years. But I'd like to see him do well first." But Bellamy also admitted that seeing Wilson become the youngest ever Wales player, beating Gareth Bale's previous record by 108 days, put his own age into perspective. "He [Wilson] is my boy's age, so probably [it brought] home to me how old I am," said Bellamy, who made his Wales debut against Jamaica in 1998. Bellamy's retirement coincided with the end of Wales' 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign which saw them finish fifth in Group A, which contained six teams. In their 10 games Wales recorded three wins, six defeats and a draw. But Bellamy, who has hinted one day he would like to manage Wales, says the future is bright for Welsh international football. "It's a good generation. A lot of them had potential but a lot have come to the fore and are fulfilling it," he said. On the draw with Belgium, ranked sixth in the world, Bellamy added: "It was a decent result. It was difficult especially when they went 1-0 up. Obviously James [Collins] going off was a bit of a blow to us we needed as much experience as we could. "We found an extra gear in the last 10-15 minutes. It was a nice way to go out." </body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned. The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms. But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize. The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable. Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two. Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home. But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties. The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation. "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize. "If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy." It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure". It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved. It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level. The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents. "Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls." This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies. Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction. Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation. "There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to. "We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added. A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms. "However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales." The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was. Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns. </body>

      <title>Clash over Wales borrowing powers</title>
      <description>The first minister and Welsh secretary clash at a Downing Street meeting over delays in giving the Welsh government the power to borrow money.</description>

      <body>The first minister has clashed with the Welsh secretary over delays in giving the Welsh government the power to borrow money. Carwyn Jones also accused the prime minister of "holding Wales back" over the issue, which was raised at a meeting at Downing Street. UK ministers have agreed in principle to give Wales borrowing powers. But the deal is tied up in a delayed package that would also see the Welsh government get control of some taxes. David Cameron has said he is attracted by the idea of the Welsh government raising some of its budget. First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "The message I put to the prime minister was 'come on, stop holding Wales back. Let's get some sense here over the recommendations that have been made by the UK government's own commission to give Wales a financial package to take Wales forward in the future'." On Sunday Mr Jones warned it would be a "disaster" for Wales if borrowing powers recommended by the Silk Commission were not devolved. He told BBC Radio Wales's Sunday Supplement that without more powers to borrow money, planned £1bn M4 improvements "will not happen". During Wednesday's meeting, Secretary of State for Wales David Jones said it was the Welsh government's responsibility to maintain the M4 and had been since devolution. "It is rather rich for the Welsh government not to upgrade the M4 to a proper standard and somehow blame the UK government for that when it was never the UK government's responsibility," he said. The first minister claimed that if the package - a response to last year's report by the Silk commission which is examining the future of devolution - was not agreed by next month, a law to transfer the powers would not be delivered by the next general election. But the Welsh secretary said it was important to get the package right, and UK ministers were still considering submissions to a consultation on the devolution of stamp duty land tax. The pair met at a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee, made up of the devolved administrations and the UK government. Last month, Mr Cameron denied blocking further devolution and said he was attracted by the idea of the Welsh government being able to raise some of its budget. But he had said the "bubble" in Cardiff was "completely obsessed" about powers when the real issue was economic recovery. Almost a year ago, the commission set up by the UK government and chaired by former assembly clerk Paul Silk said ministers in Cardiff should be allowed to vary some tax rates and some borrowing powers. A decision had been initially expected in the spring. The proposals to ease motorway congestion around Newport, with options of routes swinging south of the existing M4, are currently out to consultation. Chancellor George Osborne has called it one of the most important road schemes in the UK. </body>

      <title>Call to increase AMs from 60 to 100</title>
      <description>The number of AMs in the Welsh assembly needs to be increased from 60 to 100 in order for them to properly scrutinise the government, a report says.</description>

      <body>The number of AMs in the Welsh assembly needs to be increased from 60 to 100 in order for them to properly scrutinise the government, a report has said. The Electoral Reform Society and the UK's Changing Union project researched the assembly's size. They found it had a much smaller number of AMs compared to similar law-making bodies around the world. The Welsh government said it would be premature to speculate ahead of a decision on extra assembly powers. The Scottish Parliament has 129 members, while Northern Ireland's Assembly has 108. The report, Size Matters - Making the National Assembly more effective, says the backbench AMs are badly overstretched and are struggling to effectively scrutinise a "powerful and well-resourced" government. It is not the first time the number of AMs has been questioned. In 2004, the Richard Commission, which looked at expanding the assembly's powers, recommended 80 AMs once it received law-making powers. Those recommendations were not implemented. The Silk Commission, set up by the UK government, is currently looking at the devolution settlement in Wales and has already said ministers in Cardiff should be given the power to vary some tax rates. The new report found 80 was "an arbitrary number", and said after an international comparison of similar bodies, the number of AMs should be 100. An assembly expanded to this size would cost taxpayers about £10.1m per year, but the report's authors argued that with the number of MPs and local councillors both likely to be reduced, it was time for a "mature debate" about the balance of political representation. Presiding officer Rosemary Butler has previously called for the number of AMs to increase, but the Welsh government said at the time there was "no appetite" among the public for more politicians. Deputy presiding officer David Melding AM said: "I welcome this report which has, for the first time, provided us with some relevant international comparisons and analysis of the demands on assembly members. "I am sure this report will play an important role in informing the current debate as we move towards the publication of the Silk Commission's inquiry." Steve Brooks, director of the Electoral Reform Society in Wales, said: "As more and more powers are added to the assembly, AMs are buckling under the weight of devolution." Chair of the UK's Changing Union project, Professor Richard Wyn Jones, said: "Few, if any serious observers would argue that just over 40 backbench assembly members is enough to do the job effectively. "Indeed the evidence clearly shows that even without the additional financial powers already recommended by the Silk Commission, the National Assembly is overstretched." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "It would be premature for us to speculate on what any additional powers might mean for the size of the National Assembly, given we do not yet know what the Silk Commission will recommend." The Welsh Conservatives said: "Job creation for politicians would rightly be questioned by the public at what remains a challenging time for the Welsh economy. "What is urgently needed is more scrutiny of legislation, better engagement with the public and more topical and extensive assembly proceedings." Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said with the prospect of financial and taxation powers becoming more real, there was a need to ensure that the assembly was able to "meet the increased demands". Eluned Parrott AM said the Lib Dems supported a rise to 80 AMs. "While I understand that increasing the number of politicians is never going to be popular, it's right that we should have an open and honest debate about the issue," she said, adding the people of Wales would get more capacity to scrutinise with additional AMs. </body>

      <description>Lions and Wales lock Ian Evans would consider leaving Ospreys if they were not in a competition like the Heineken Cup.</description>

      <body>Ospreys lock Ian Evans would consider leaving the Welsh region if they were not competing in the Heineken Cup. The British and Irish Lions and Wales international, 29, is in the final year of his contract with Ospreys. English and French clubs plan to quit the Heineken Cup for a new tournament, which may include Pro12 teams. "If that competition wasn't to go ahead I think it would be a massive sway to the way your future is going to pan out," he said. "You need that intensity. I think the Heineken Cup is just below international rugby and you need play that week in week out if you've got any international aspirations. "There's no room for error really and it's pushing you as a person." Evans was in the unfamiliar position of being dropped for the Heineken Cup opener against Leinster, which ended in a 19-9 home defeat, and is a doubt to face Northampton this Sunday because of injury. But the 6ft 8in forward said if he was not being selected for big games then that could also have a bearing on his future. "Last week I more or less wasn't selected and obviously that was very disappointing," Evans said. "It's probably been the worst week that I've been involved in rugby for a long, long time and I was really disappointed not to be involved. "This week I've got a niggling Achilles injury and I'm just trying to make sure that's right. "It is a massive shock [not to get selected], not that I take away anything from the competition - I think James King [who faced Leinster at lock] has been playing extremely well." Ospreys have lost a number of high-profile players to France in recent years, including Wales stars Mike Phillips, Lee Byrne and James Hook. The Welsh region's chief executive, Andrew Hore, admitted in August that the region could find it hard to keep hold of some of their Lions stars. Lions and Wales tight-head prop Adam Jones has started negotiations with the region over a new deal but admitted he would consider a move to France. The contract of Evans' fellow lock Alun Wyn Jones also expires at the end of the 2013-14 season. Evans added: "The Heineken Cup's the biggest games, that's what you build into and if you're not involved in them then what else are you meant to do, with one year left on your contract? "I haven't had any offers as such yet, but I suppose things will start coming my way hopefully sooner or later. "[Going abroad] would not appeal to me, but first and foremost my wife is about to give birth at the end of November and I'm quite a family-orientated person, but I want to play competitive rugby." Meanwhile, defeat by Leinster left Ospreys with an uphill struggle in this weekend's second-round match at Northampton. "To lose your home game has put us under a lot of pressure really, but there's one thing for sure, I think the boys react under pressure," Evans said. "Northampton lost out in Castres and playing in front of their home crowd and with the team they've got, I think it'll be a great competition to see who is going to come out on top." </body>

      <body>Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has said Wales's youngest player Harry Wilson is not ready for the Premier League. The Liverpool academy player, 16, made his full international debut as an 87th-minute substitute in Tuesday's 1-1 World Cup qualifier draw with Belgium - beating Gareth Bale's record. Rodgers said Wilson is a "very talented young player", but added: "He's not near [playing in] the Premier League. "I was surprised. Obviously Wales had a lot of injuries." Rodgers said he was informed of Wilson's inclusion in the squad by Liverpool and Wales goal-scoring legend Ian Rush. Wales manager Chris Coleman had turned to the youngster after injuries disrupted preparations for the final World Cup qualifiers. Wrexham-born Wilson was an unused substitute for last Friday's 1-0 win over Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium before making his debut in Brussels. "To have him here at the club is brilliant," Rodgers added. "He knows he will have a great opportunity here if he continues to develop at Liverpool. "It's important that we just stay calm and let him develop at his own rate." Wilson earning a Wales cap also saw his granddad win £125,000 from a £50 bet placed in when the teenager was 18 months old. </body>

      <body>Cardiff Blues are set to announce Dale McIntosh as their new defence coach on Friday, BBC Sport Wales understands. New Zealand-born McIntosh, capped twice by Wales, is expected to leave his role in charge of Welsh Premiership side Pontypridd. The 43-year-old moves to the Arms Park following Rob Powell's departure as Blues defence coach. Phil Davies' side conceded six tries in their opening Heineken Cup defeat by Exeter last weekend. Pontypridd issued a statement  which read: "It was inevitable that sooner or later our successful head coach would be appointed to a senior post at regional level. "Dale McIntosh has been associated with Pontypridd RFC for 24 years. "In that period his influence and his contribution to the success of the club cannot be over-estimated." Defending champions Toulon visit Cardiff in the second round on Saturday. McIntosh has coached at Pontypridd since 2007, graduating to head coach in the 2009-10 season. He has also been involved with Wales at age-grade level. As a coach at one of two Premiership clubs in the region aligned to the Blues - Cardiff RFC are the other - McIntosh has already been involved with the region in a part-time capacity. </body>

Patient advocate Julia Black told BBC Wales the system must be made fairer as there is a "huge disparity" between which drugs patients can access depending on where they live. Her comments came after Wales' Chief Medical Officer Ruth Hussey said the system for giving cancer drugs in Wales needs to get better. An investigation by the BBC's The Wales Report had found that patients in Wales with the same type of cancer are getting different levels of care.

      <description>Former game advisor urges more concussion protection</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said. The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia. Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players. He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this. He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees. Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players. "They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do." The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB. It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game. In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously". "This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message. "Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers. "Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element." The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board. "We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times." A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team. Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing. He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital. His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch. "At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said. "He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles. "It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today." Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK. And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers. "I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added. "Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children. "We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way." The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research. "Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <title>Wales players 'want Coleman to stay'</title>
      <description>Players want Chris Coleman to sign new Wales manager contract</description>

      <body>Wales' players want Chris Coleman to continue as the national team manager, according to full-back Neil Taylor. Wales ended their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high with a win over Macedonia and a draw in Belgium. And Taylor told BBC Radio Wales: "We've always said we wanted him to stay. We want stability, he has the right ideas and knows what he's talking about." Coleman's contract ends after next month's game with Finland and he has said he is undecided over his future. Taylor added that he had sympathy for the problems Coleman has encountered in his time in charge of the national side, since succeeding the late Gary Speed in January 2012. "It's got to be difficult for him when he gets half a squad, or not even half a squad like this time," Taylor added. "But it shows what he got out of us is what he's capable of and we want to build on that for him. "Hopefully when we get all the players back, what we can produce should be great." Taylor also paid tribute to Cardiff forward Craig Bellamy, who made his final international appearance in Brussels before retiring from the international game. Bellamy is Wales' third most-capped player, having made 78 appearances for his country and fifth on the all-time scorers' chart with 19 goals. "It's been a privilege to play with him and I'm a little bit gutted that he's retiring to be honest, but I think the body tells you sometimes that you need to," Taylor said. "He's a massive loss to Wales but what a shift. I mean this guy has turned up for every friendly, not just the ones that matter. "He always wants to win, always wants to be involved and against Belgium he was as hungry as ever and led by example for the boys who were winning their first cap." Taylor is sure that Wales can build on their promising end to the campaign ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, which will start in September 2014. "We have got to make sure this time that it does bode well for the future and that we do well in the future," Taylor added. "We can't turn it on and off and the manager next time will want all his players fit. "If we can play like that with our best players as well, then we look a different team." </body>

      <description>How will cash-strapped Welsh councils save money?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24525092</url>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government. It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year. Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms. Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16. So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls: Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard. "It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable." Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents. "The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services. "We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future." Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services. "The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course. "We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15. "The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council. Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions. "This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government. "The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner. "We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration. "However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect." A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement. "Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years." Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October. The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years. Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities. The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need. It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils. However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely. Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation. Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched. Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months. Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected. "This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said. "We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further. "However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs. "I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget." Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings. "Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups. "Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected." A spokesman for Ceredigion said: "Unfortunately, no decisions have been made." In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year. "Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'." A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it. "The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions. "Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months. "Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year. "The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement. "On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas. "We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed." The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is: Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability. "It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling. "These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'. "We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months. "Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position." The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers. A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible." A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15. "Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m. "This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year. "We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Merthyr Tydfil council. Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government. "Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level. "We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population. "We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding. "We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut. "We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years." The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks. Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy. It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services. Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off. Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December. A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon." A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years). A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be. A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000. A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government". "The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson. "The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'. "The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound. "Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk. "A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year." Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales. "As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible. "I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges. "The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting." The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year. It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure. Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending. "We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said. Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15. Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%. "Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16. "We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse. "This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs. "Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care. "The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions. "We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties." Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable. "This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week. "Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m. "Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts. "Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months. "In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services. "My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives. "In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide. "Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities." Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts. Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year. Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year. Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend. Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations. The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017. Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services. Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making. "This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide." He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views." Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea. Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December. The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years. Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered. It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made. The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. "Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions. "We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for." The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall. It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services. It is due to meet to discuss proposals. Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham. "In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care. "But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago. "Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come. "Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult." With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible". The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. "Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required. It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include: </body>

      <title>Norwegian Kenya attack suspect named</title>
      <description>A Norwegian man being investigated over the Westgate terror attacks is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, the BBC's Newsnight programme learns.</description>

      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. Watch the full report in Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>
      <description>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.</description>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <title>Hundreds more Madeleine calls</title>
      <description>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since a BBC Crimewatch appeal on Monday.</description>

      <body>Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have received more than 2,400 calls and emails since an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch on Monday. Writing on Twitter, Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood said further appeals on similar programmes in the Netherlands and Germany had led to hundreds of calls. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she disappeared in Portugal in May 2007. Det Ch Insp Redwood has said her abduction could have been pre-planned. Detectives released two e-fits of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz at 22:00 on the night Madeleine went missing and it was revealed that they now suspected Madeleine could have been taken later than previously thought - just before her mother returned to the apartment to check on her. Following his appeal on Crimewatch, Det Ch Insp Redwood travelled to the Netherlands and Germany. Clickable map and timeline He tweeted on Thursday: ""Over 350 people have phoned into the studio of Opsporing Verzocht, Holland and 500 in Germany on Aktenzeichen XY. "Those enquiries are now being assessed and prioritised. Any deemed high being actioned." He added that the police were "very pleased" with the information they had been receiving. The next stage of the appeal will be in Ireland later this month. The Metropolitan Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information. Det Ch Insp Redwood told Crimewatch a number of men had been seen by witnesses in the area on the day Madeleine vanished and one theory was they could have been carrying out reconnaissance. He said they wanted to track down men seen "lurking suspiciously" near the McCanns' apartment. The Metropolitan Police say their inquiries have led to the new timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance being significantly changed. The two e-fit images released are of a man a family had seen with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment. Det Ch Insp Redwood said he could be the man who took Madeleine - but there could be an innocent explanation. He also said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. Police are also looking at possible bogus charity collectors operating in the area at the time and have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. Police have also released e-fit images of two men seen in the area around the time that Madeleine disappeared. Two are of fair-haired men who fit similar descriptions. The Portuguese police shelved their inquiry in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this year. </body>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled. The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it triggered a device on 6 March last year. Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them". A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident. Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001. Two Warriors left on a patrol from a base at Lashkar Gah, southern Afghanistan, just after 18:30 local time. Soon after, the Warrior travelling in front triggered a pressure plate which detonated an improvised explosive device (IEDs). A fire broke out almost instantly, setting off ammunition inside the vehicle, the inquest heard. Fellow soldiers tried, in vain, to put out the fire and get into the bombed vehicle. The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast. "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives," Mr Salter said. "At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer." He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest". "These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added. He said it was clear "significant steps" had been taken to improve the vehicles. Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that". He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised IEDs in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place. Maj Nelson was among a number of soldiers who told the inquest they felt safest, when on patrol, in a warrior. "Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said. "It's as good as we can make it." He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and improvements to ways of getting out in an emergency. Improved fuel tanks were also being fitted to the vehicles, he added. The inquest heard that, when the order was given to leave at 18:00, Pte Kershaw had volunteered to take the place of another soldier, who was just returning from a shower. Speaking after the verdict, his mother, Monica, said it was "a pure quirk of fate that Chris should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended". "I am still struggling with this but how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers," she said. And Emma Hickman, who has battled to prove her fiance, Pte Wade, fathered her daughter before he was killed in the incident, said: "From the struggle to establish Lexie's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss." The Ministry of Defence released Pte Wade's DNA last year so Ms Hickman could prove paternity and put his name on the birth certificate of their daughter, Lexie-Mai. </body>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The lettings group said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, refuting suggestions that several distinct types were around at the same time, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H.habilis. But many features from the braincase were also unique to H.erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has unveiled the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remains known anywhere in the world. They are also the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group which emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection, it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation which had previously puzzled archaeologists, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. Their comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now." "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H.erectus, H.habilis and H.rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H.erectus, and not present in H.habilis and H.rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils can be "lumped into an evolving H.erectus lineage". "Only H.Erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland if a government application to the European Commission is successful.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in place in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural towns in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those towns. The Scottish towns are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." The UK most now secure approval for the expanded scheme from the EC, which is expected to announce its decision next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander added. The 10 towns selected for the application have higher pump prices than in locations that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" after recent back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," he said. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of the injury. He recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals , but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. He tweeted a picture of himself in hospital with his thumbs up after the operation. </body>

Bellew, 30, is a former British and Commonwealth champion and was beaten by then WBO champion Nathan Cleverly of Wales in 2011. But he beat Isaac Chilemba in a rematch in May  , having drawn the first fight, to secure a second world title shot. Stevenson, 36, has been beaten once in 23 fights and will be a big favourite. The Haiti-born Canadian won the title with a first-round knockout of Chad Dawson in June  and defended it with a seventh-round retirement of Tavoris Cloud in September. Stevenson's only defeat was as a super-middleweight in 2010 and he has 19 knockouts in 22 victories. </body>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday. Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament. England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches. But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December. The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded. But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body. Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament. Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions. England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay. Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy. The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football. Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations. France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system. "From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder. He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points. As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier. Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot. Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign. Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel. </body>

      <title>Di Resta 'faces uncertain F1 future'</title>
      <description>Paul Di Resta's manager admits the Formula 1 future of the 27-year-old Scottish driver is not guaranteed.</description>

      <body>Paul Di Resta's manager admits the Scot faces an uncertain future in Formula 1. The 27-year-old's Force India team have an option on him for 2014 but there are no guarantees they will retain him. And Richard Goddard, who represents Di Resta, is concerned the team could opt for a driver who brings sponsorship and leave his client without a drive. "It's difficult to know what will happen - there are a lot of drivers in the sport with money and a lot of teams that need money," Goddard said. "That is probably the biggest issue, that it is not just outright talent that gets you a seat in the car any more. "But Force India have always been very fair in that they have tended to put outright talent in the car and they haven't looked to a driver to bring in income, which is great. "That's because they are well funded by a couple of individuals and corporations who are able to do that - and hopefully they will carry on doing that. "Some other teams are looking for drivers to bring in income, and unfortunately Paul doesn't have a government-backed scheme or a rich billionaire standing behind him." Di Resta's future may not, though, be determined by a so-called 'pay-driver'. Force India are one of the teams in negotiations with the highly-rated Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg, who was Di Resta's team-mate in 2012. BBC F1 chief analyst Eddie Jordan said at the Japanese Grand Prix last weekend that he was "fairly sure" Hulkenberg would race for Force India next year. "I believe, in my opinion, it is certain," Jordan said, adding: "My reputation rests on it." Some sources say that if Hulkenberg does re-sign for Force India, the team would drop Di Resta and keep their other driver Adrian Sutil, even though he and Hulkenberg are both German. Hulkenberg, though, is also in the frame at Lotus. Sources close to Lotus say they intend to sign him but are trying to sort out a partnership with a US-Middle Eastern investment consortium called Quantum Motorsports before concluding the contract. The proposed deal with Quantum has been dragging on since the summer, when the group were called Infinity Racing, before changing their name to Quantum to avoid confusion with a sponsor of word champions Red Bull, the Nissan luxury car brand Infiniti. Di Resta's cause has not been helped by an abject run of form in the second half of the season, which is partly due to the team's loss of pace following a change in the construction of the Pirelli tyres. He scored points in seven of the first eight races this year but the team have earned just three points - all won by Sutil - since the tyres were changed. Goddard said: "It is a tricky situation. We're still under option - we haven't been told we're not going to be signed. "But if the option lapses and doesn't get taken up, then it is a case of waiting to see if Force India come back to us and negotiate on a new basis. "It's difficult to determine because this last half of the season he [Di Resta] has been adversely affected by the tyres. "He hasn't produced the results he would want to produce, but overall it is the team under-delivering on what it should have delivered." </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Bright poor 'held back for decades'</title>
      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>More than 9,000 miles of rivers were diverted underground or re-routed as Britain's cities expanded during the Victorian era. Now the Environment Agency is set to uncover so-called "lost rivers", and return them to the nation.

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the country's most common mental health problems.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world, but few sufferers receive any medical help. Some are chained up, others are subject to even more brutal treatments.</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <body>A police officer shot dead when he tackled a gunman in the street near his home has posthumously been given a national bravery award. PC Ian Dibell, 41, was voted as the most courageous officer at the annual Police Bravery Awards, where 13 other officers were also honoured. They included a PC who dived into a quarry to save a boy from drowning. Mr Dibell died while trying to stop Peter Reeve, who had fired at a couple in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. He was selected as the overall winner after officers were nominated for awards by 37 forces across England and Wales. Other winners were: Peter Reeve, 64, had fired shots at his neighbour Trevor Marshall and Mr Marshall's girlfriend, Katarzyna Karolak, and then chased Mr Marshall in his blue Toyota. PC Dibell, a father-of-two, leaned into the car window to try and grab the gun, and a bullet passed through his hand and into his chest, causing fatal injuries. The constable had ran back to his house to get his warrant card when he realised a gunman was on the loose, meaning that technically he was on duty when he died. Mr Reeve took his own life in a churchyard in Writtle, Essex, the next day. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Officers put others' lives before their own. "Sadly, as our winner's story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. "PC Ian Dibell was a valiant team player; his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life - always putting others before himself." Home Secretary Theresa May said: "Ian Dibell's death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. "PC Dibell was off duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm's way. "His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world." </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Scotland's first minister has called on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Alex Salmond met representatives of operators Ineos and the Unite union on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices. The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK. Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%. The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland. Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase. "Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible. "Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency." </body>

      <body>A stone was discovered lodged in County Armagh student Natasha McShane's throat following a random street assault in Chicago, a court has heard. Ms McShane's injuries were so serious that a brain surgeon was immediately told of her admission to hospital. Heriberto Viramontes is accused of the attempted murder of Ms McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in April 2010. Ms McShane has been left with extensive brain injuries after being hit with a baseball bat. She has also struggled with her speech and mobility. The Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago heard evidence on Thursday from the trauma surgeon on duty in the emergency room of Illinois Masonic Hospital when Ms McShane and Ms Jurich were first admitted. Trauma surgeon Dr Marius Katilius said Ms McShane suffered a traumatic brain injury, with blood discovered both inside and outside the skull. Three separate lacerations were discovered. There was blood in her hair, and on her scalp and face. There was "a lot of blood", Dr Katelius said. But he also revealed that following a scan "an opaque structure in the back of the throat" was identified. The medical team "pulled out a stone from the back of the throat". The friends were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago three and a half years ago. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, was a 23-year-old student attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. She had been on an exchange programme, studying urban planning. Her family watched intently as items of her clothing found at the crime scene were pulled from a brown paper evidence bag at the trial. Images of the scene, with Ms McShane's cream-coloured jacket entwined in an olive green sweater beside pools of blood, were also shown in court. A police evidence technician was giving testimony on what she found at the scene. Later, images of Mr Viramontes at a petrol station were shown. Prosecutors allege he tried to use Stacy Jurich's credit card at the station less than half an hour after the two young women were attacked. The trial earlier heard evidence from Ms Jurich, who also suffered serious injuries in the attack. In testimony, Ms Jurich described the moment she was hit. "I heard my head being hit and I felt an excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium," she told the court. "Stupid bitch," her attacker whispered as he snatched her purse and ran off. Ms Jurich said she never saw a face as all her attention was directed towards her friend. "She was not moving on the ground. The blood started coming out of her head," she said. Mr Viramontes, 34, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges linked to his alleged involvement in the attack on 23 April 2010. Apart from Ms Jurich, the trial has also heard testimony from Sheila McShane, Natasha McShane's mother. She described how her daughter remains severely disabled, unable to walk without support, incapable of conversation and barely able to communicate. The jury saw video footage of Ms McShane as she was helped to walk and of her struggling to pick up and drink from a cup of tea. The state's key witness, Marcy Cruz, has pleaded guilty to attempted murder for her role in the attack. The trial of Mr Viramontes is expected to last up to two weeks. </body>

      <title>Trust admits child deaths liability</title>
      <description>Belfast Health Trust accepts liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland. Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996. Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down. The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry. Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water. Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995. Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year. She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids. However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs. In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus. The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006. However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust". He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard. During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain. It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging. The public inquiry is also investigating specific issues around the treatment of 15-year-old Conor Mitchell who was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital on 8 May 2003. The following day, the teenager was transferred the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, where he died on 12 May. At Thursday's hearing, the Southern Health Trust admitted that guidelines had not been followed when the teenager was treated in Craigavon Area Hospital and it apologised to his family. However, the Southern Health Trust has not accepted liability for Conor's death. The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made". Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done". Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered. The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals. It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth. The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths. On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson. Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry. She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed. </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>The body responsible for amateur boxing in Wales is "not fit for purpose" and "does not qualify for public funding", an independent audit report says. The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: "It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. "Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. "We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money." In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over £190,000 - more than double its £89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: "Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. "Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level." The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to "improve the culture at WABA", and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: "Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible." He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were "simply not acceptable". Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: "In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations." </body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba. The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC. The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordnance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war. There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year. The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said. He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports. This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds. </body>

      <body>An appeal court in Tunisia has acquitted rapper Ahmed Ben Ahmed, known as Klay BBJ, on charges of insulting the authorities in his songs. The rapper was jailed in September for six months for insulting the police at a concert in the resort of Hammamet. "The court has decided to reject the accusations," the AFP news agency quotes the judge as saying. During the performance in August, he sang alongside fellow rapper Weld El 15, who has been on the run since then. They had both initially been sentenced in absentia in August to 21 months in prison. Klay BBJ lost an appeal in September and was immediately jailed. But on his second appeal hearing in Grombalia, south of the capital, Tunis, the judge said his sentenced had been annulled and he was released. Weld El 15, whose real name is Ala Yaacoub, has been in trouble before for his song The Police Are Dogs. He was given a two-year sentence in June, which was later suspended but he went into hiding following his latest conviction in August. Since the 2011 revolution, which toppled long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there have been tensions between secular Tunisians and Islamists. "Our songs criticise the current situation in Tunisia and the government, no more and no less," AFP news agency quoted Klay BBJ as saying in September. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party has been in government since elections in 2011. </body>

      <body>A woman who was gang-raped in the Indian city of Mumbai in August has fainted in court while giving evidence. The photojournalist, who was attacked while on assignment in a deserted mill, was taken to a local hospital. Earlier the victim, aged 22, identified four of the men accused of raping her. Women's safety has been the focus of attention in India since a brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi last year, after which the Indian government strengthened its sexual violence laws. The photojournalist, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence for more than four hours when she collapsed, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam. The victim was very composed, but was "under mental pressure", Mr Nikam told the BBC. He said she had identified all four men who stood trial in court on Thursday. A fifth suspect is being tried separately by a juvenile court. The photographer also identified pornographic video clips that she said she was shown while she was raped, said the special public prosecutor. Proceedings were stopped when the rape survivor collapsed, Mr Nikam said. Last month, four men were convicted and sentenced to death over the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December. The case led to widespread protests across India and highlighted the extent of attacks on women in the country. A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty, was approved by India's parliament earlier this year. But many working in the legal system say not enough is done to protect those who bring rape cases to court. </body>

      <body>A plane carrying 49 passengers and crew that crashed in southern Laos hit bad weather as it came into land, officials in the South East Asian nation said. The Lao Airlines plane, flying from the capital Vientiane, crashed into the Mekong river on Wednesday near its destination of Pakse. All 44 passengers and five crew are believed to have died. Footage of the scene on Thursday showed divers in the Mekong river, pulling out parts of the wreckage. The passengers and crew came from a total of 10 nations, the airline said. Seventeen Laos nationals were on board, plus travellers from France, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US. "Upon preparing to land at Pakse Airport the aircraft ran into extreme bad weather conditions and was reportedly crashed into the Mekong river,'' the Laos Ministry of Public Works and Transport said in a statement. State-run Laos news agency quoted an eyewitness as saying that the plane "appeared to be hit by a strong wind, causing its head to ascend and pushing it away from the airport area". A senior aviation official from Laos was quoted in other reports as saying the tail end of Typhoon Nari may have been a factor in the crash. An Agence-France Presse (AFP) reporter on the scene told of debris floating in the river and suitcases buried in mud on the river banks. "The search teams in Laos are taking the bodies to a local hospital," Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee told AFP. An official in Pakse was quoted as saying at least six bodies had been retrieved. The plane was an ATR 72-600 twin turboprop engine aircraft. Its manufacturer, ATR, said in a statement that the plane was "delivered from the production line in March 2013". The company said it would co-operate fully with the investigation. Australian's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said that six Australians, including four members of one family, were aboard the plane. An Australian aid worker and his father were also among those believed to have been killed. DFAT released a photo of the two Australians - father and son Gordon and Michael Creighton. The family said in a statement that they had "lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best mate in one tragic circumstance". Relatives of the Rhodes family also released a photo of Gavin, a tax consultant, his wife, Phoumalaysy and their two young children. A DFAT spokesperson said that consular officials were in contact with the families of the victims and were travelling to Pakse. However, a DFAT statement said: "Lao authorities have told our embassy in Vientiane they do not expect any survivors.'' The route between the capital Vientiane and Pakse is popular with the growing numbers of tourists visiting Laos, correspondents say. Lao Airlines is small company, with just 14 aircraft in its fleet. It flies several domestic routes and has flights to other countries in the region like China, Thailand and Singapore. </body>

      <description>Eleven Nobel laureates urge Russian President Vladimir Putin to drop piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists.</description>

      <body>Eleven Nobel prize-winners have written to Vladimir Putin asking the Russian president to drop charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists. The 30, who come from 18 nations, were held last month during a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The signatories - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - described the charges of piracy as "excessive". But Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, responded that the president had no power to influence the courts. The Greenpeace activists, who complain of being detained in harsh conditions, face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. The Netherlands has launched legal action to try to free the activists and the ship, and more than 1.4m people have joined a Greenpeace campaign demanding their release. In the letter, which was released by Greenpeace, the laureates urge Mr Putin "to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy against the 28 Greenpeace activists, freelance photographer and freelance videographer are dropped, and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law. "We were heartened by your statement, on September 25th, that you did not believe the Greenpeace crew members were pirates," the letter goes on to say. "As you know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil drilling operations threatening the Arctic. "Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise. An oil spill under these icy waters would have a catastrophic impact on one of the most pristine, unique and beautiful landscapes on earth," the letter continues. It is also signed by former East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta, Northern Irish peace campaigner Betty Williams, and Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi. But Putin spokesman Mr Peskov said the laureates had addressed their appeal to the wrong person, reported Russian news agency RIA Novosti. "The president treats Nobel prize winners and their opinions with great respect and attention. But in this case, the president is a wrong addressee," the agency quoted him as saying. He said President Putin could not file or drop charges. "Investigative bodies deal with it, and everyone should wait for the end of the investigation process and the court's verdict. "A law is a law," he added. </body>

      <body>A grand coalition between Germany's centre-right and centre-left parties has moved a step nearer, nearly a month after the general election. The leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed on formal negotiations. They reached agreement at a third round of exploratory talks in Berlin. CDU leaders seem to have softened their opposition to a national minimum wage, a concession to the SPD. Some of the negotiating will be over who gets which ministry, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from the German capital. If the SPD take charge of finance, the departure of current minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may mean a softening of German economic policy. Forming a new German government can be a long and difficult process but all the signs now point to a grand coalition, our correspondent says. The CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the CSU, fell just short of an outright majority at the polls on 22 September. The CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. Germany is the EU's most populous country and has its biggest economy, making it a pivotal member of the eurozone. "At the end of the third round of exploratory talks we are convinced that we can find sensible solutions for both sides, and most of all for the country, even on disputed questions," SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel said. "The conservatives know... that a nationwide minimum wage of 8.5 euros [£7.2; $11.5]... is one of the central tasks and without this a coalition would not make sense for the SPD. That was no big surprise for the CDU/CSU." CDU secretary general Hermann Groehe said: "We have a joint goal of seeing a sensible minimum wage ruling - I am sure we will find a result but we didn't discuss it today." "In the three exploratory sessions it became clear that with regards to identifying the most pressing political tasks facing Germany over the next four years and how to deal with these, we can find enough common ground to rule this country successfully," he said. The chairman of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, said the paramount issue for him remained "no tax increases and no new debt", according to the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats so the two-term chancellor set about seeking a new partner. Talks with the Greens ended in failure on Wednesday and both of the big parties have ruled out a coalition with the Left Party. As well as the proposed minimum wage, taxation will also be a key issue for the talks. The SPD has not won an election since 2002 and it joined a previous grand coalition under Mrs Merkel in 2005. One final hurdle for the coalition deal will be a vote by SPD party members, promised by the party leadership, on whether to endorse it. </body>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>Venezuelan rescue teams have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people who died in a plane crash in January. The small plane carrying six passengers plunged into the Caribbean shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands. It was located in June some 70m (230ft) under the water, north of the Venezuelan archipelago. An investigation is underway to establish the causes of the accident. The bodies retrieved were those of Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni; two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in Los Roques, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi; and Venezuelan co-pilot Juan Carlos Ferrer. They were flown to a morgue in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Mr Missoni was the son of Ottavio Missoni, founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. Relatives are due to arrive in Venezuela tonight. Rescue teams have been trying to recover the remains of the sixth victim: Venezuelan pilot German Marchant. Following the twin engine aircraft's disappearance on 4 January, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <title>Inspectors hail progress in Syria</title>
      <description>Chemical weapons inspectors say they are making good progress in Syria, having completed nearly 50% of their work.</description>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria say they have completed nearly half of their work in the country. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW) said the team was making good progress in its mission to inspect more than than 20 sites. However he said security remained a concern for the 60 inspectors - who have been in Syria since 1 October. "A few" sites remained inaccessible to the team for security reasons, he said. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August. The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict. The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting sites and destroying equipment. Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014. The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC that there had been a number of security incidents over the last few days which had given the inspectors "cause for concern". On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus. Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights. The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative. An international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday. He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN. More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country. Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August. It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian man who used a tractor to break into an Israeli army base in the West Bank has been shot and killed by soldiers, according to a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. The man broke down the gate to the base, between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Military doctors treated the man for his injuries but he died a short time later. There were no Israeli injuries. Palestinian sources told AFP that the dead man was named Yusef Ahmed al-Radaydeh. There have been a number of recent deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the West Bank, as well as the shooting of a nine-year-old girl a fortnight ago. The BBC's Kevin Connolly, in Jerusalem, says the violent incidents form an unpromising backdrop to the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, which continue behind closed doors. </body>

      <title>Dozens held in Canada shale protest</title>
      <description>Canadian police arrest at least 40 people, including a First Nation chief, during a protest over shale gas development in New Brunswick province.</description>

      <body>At least 40 people were arrested after a protest at a shale gas development in the Canadian province of New Brunswick turned violence, say police. A shot was fired, petrol bombs were tossed and police cars torched at the blockade near the town of Rexton. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said arrests were made for firearms violations, threats and intimidation. Protesters have blockaded a staging area where an energy firm stores its equipment since 30 September. The protest turned violent after officers moved in to enforce a court injunction won by the company to remove the protesters' highway camp, said police. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officials say at least five of their vehicles were set on fire and destroyed, Molotov cocktails were thrown at officers, and at least one shot was fired by someone who was not a police officer. SWN Resources, owned by Houston-based Southwestern Energy, is exploring the coastal province for shale gas. The reserves are removed from the ground by a controversial practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Opponents of the shale gas sector say drinking water can be polluted during the extraction process. The protesters, including regional First Nations, want the seismic testing to stop. "There have been threats made to employees who were working with a private security firm at the site, as well as firearms offences, incidents of intimidation, mischief and other criminal behaviour," RCMP spokeswoman Constable Jullie Rogers-Marsh said in a statement. "For those reasons, and to ensure public safety, police action was required." Among those arrested on Thursday were members of the Elsipogtog First Nation, including their Chief, Arren Sock, Canadian media reported. Former Elsipogtog chief Susan Levi-Peters told Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail the RCMP vehicles were set on fire after Mr Sock and several other tribal members were arrested while trying to intervene. A councillor from the Elsipogtog First Nation told the Canadian Press news agency that police had used pepper spray on the protesters. "They sprayed the crowd that was there," Robert Levi said. "The chief was manhandled a little bit and all hell broke loose." He added the protesters would try to stay, despite the injunction. "This is what our people have been fighting for," Mr Levi said. </body>

      <description>A special election to represent the state of New Jersey in the US Senate is won by rising Democratic star and Newark Mayor Cory Booker.</description>

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate. Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June. With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%. The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey. On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues. "I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said. Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government. Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime. Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control. Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities. While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014. When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45. </body>

      <description>Former officer on his encounters with Jimmy Savile</description>

      <body>A former police officer has spoken about some of his colleagues' attitude to Jimmy Savile in the 1960s - saying that everyone in the force knew "Jimmy liked them young". The ex-officer, who wants to remain anonymous, was with Leeds City Police in the 1960s. He used to patrol areas of the city where Savile was well known. The entertainer was in his 30s at the time and was a familiar sight in the areas of Roundhay and Headingley. It was one incident in 1965 the former policeman remembers well. Late one night, just before midnight, he noticed Jimmy Savile's Rolls Royce parked in a secluded spot on the edge of Roundhay Park. "As I went past I saw the interior lights were on," he said. "I went past but stopped and went back - I thought someone had nicked it. "He was sat in the driver's seat and was talking to a young lady in the passenger seat. She looked like Twiggy - I couldn't tell her age, perhaps 15 or 16. "I said, 'What's the matter, Jimmy - what are you doing up here?' "He said, 'Yeah, we're fine, aren't we?' And she smiled. Then he said, 'We're waiting for 12 o'clock, son.' "Why?" I asked. 'Because it's her birthday tomorrow, she's 16.' And he winked at me. "I asked the girl, 'Are you ok?' "She smiled - there was no impression she was being forced to be there. I think she wanted me to get lost as well. "Jimmy then said, 'Now get back on your bike before you lose your job.'" The officer then went on his way. He said: "If there was any impression that she was 10 or 11 I wouldn't have gone anywhere. There was no doubt whatsoever that she knew what was going to happen. "Savile gave me the impression he was justifying himself and knew what people suspected him of - he was waiting until it was legal. His attitude was, 'I'm not doing it now but in ten minutes there isn't a thing you can do about it.'" Later on in the shift he mentioned the meeting to his sergeant, who said to him: "Was she upset?" When he replied, "No", he claims the senior officer added: "We know Jimmy likes them young, he's got friends in high places." The former officer said today that the attitudes of the time were "different" and accepts that such actions today would be unthinkable. "Leeds City Police were absolutely not covering up Jimmy Savile as a paedophile," he said. "They turned a blind eye to 15-year-olds but never considered that as paedophilia. "If he was caught with an 11-year-old that would have been a different matter. You can't blame Leeds City Police for what everyone in the country was doing. I'm not saying that's right, but it was the attitude at the time." The officer later left the police force but believes that attitude of the police towards Savile lasted for years afterwards. The Leeds City force merged into the West Yorkshire Constabulary in 1974. He also believes that police may have informally talked to Savile about the age of his girlfriends in the 1960s. "Nearly everybody knew that his girlfriends wouldn't be much over 17 - I think he knew he was being watched," the former officer said. "Perhaps he was warned beforehand that he was treading on dangerous ground." He believes any new inquiry into West Yorkshire Police will not change anything. Yesterday, the independent Police Complaints Commission announced an investigation into a former officer who called colleagues in Surrey on Savile's behalf in 2009, saying he knew the former DJ personally and passing on a phone number. A recent West Yorkshire Police inquiry concluded that friendships Savile had with officers had not protected him from arrest or prosecution. But a recent review of that inquiry found it did not have the look or feel of an independent report. Today West Yorkshire Police appealed for the police officer we spoke to today to contact them. The force released a statement that said: "West Yorkshire Police are appealing for a man who spoke to the media yesterday in relation to the Jimmy Savile case to get in touch." But the former officer, who spoke on the Jeremy Vine Show yesterday, is adamant there was no special protection for Savile. "There was no conspiracy, it wasn't covered up," he said. "They all knew Jimmy Savile liked them young - and we're not talking 12 - we're talking 15. It was the culture." Jimmy Savile, a former TV presenter and radio DJ who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of victims during his career. </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24566926</url>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <title>Life in the aftermath of a killing</title>
      <description>The effect on bereaved people of a random knife murders</description>

      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories. The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one. A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned. The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice. Some people might even use the word "closure". And that, appeals not withstanding, is that. Only it never is like that. The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings. Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported. The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say. This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well. Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries. The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue. Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood. "You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events. "The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family. "One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't." The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness. "During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey. "There isn't a 'closure' with homicide." The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations. And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused. Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done. The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them. This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling. The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help. These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed. Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her. She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died. The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo. It was then that he killed him. Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine. "I lost everything that day," she says. Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress. After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post. Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators. The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster. "There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way. "My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support." Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families. "It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are. "I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it." For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example. Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14. Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk. The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital. "That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with. "I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it. "It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't." Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife. "To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis." Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes. Her ambitions for the law were put on hold. Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be. "I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says. "The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be." Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner. So too is Caroline Shearer. Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September. Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings. Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay. She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind. Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab. "I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says. "He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed." The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again. It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep. And she too had difficulties with eating. She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son. None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod. Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans. But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there. "I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod. "The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is." Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances. They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD. Can these families ever recover? Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now. "It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with." </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>
      <date>1382025093</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70547000/jpg/_70547057_70546905.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. Britain needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>At university with Cory Booker</title>
      <description>'How new US Senator gave me my greatest sporting moment'</description>

      <body>The US has a new senator, Cory Booker, who swept to an election win in New Jersey on Wednesday. The Democrat is tipped for great things by his supporters, which comes as no surprise to those that knew him at university. In Marshall Curry's Oscar-nominated film about Cory Booker's unsuccessful 2002 campaign to be mayor of Newark, New Jersey, he shakes hands with a girl while out canvassing. She turns to the documentary-maker's camera and says: "Smell my hands 'cos I just touched Cory Booker. "He smells like the future." Now Cory Booker has earned a Senate seat after beating Republican Steve Lonegan this week, it's worth recalling how much star quality he had when he was at The Queen's College, Oxford, in the early 1990s. He was a Rhodes scholar with a masters degree from Stanford. I was five years younger and just starting out on my first degree. Booker was such a striking figure that you always noticed him. I've never met anyone with as much charisma as Cory - he could make you feel better about yourself with a nod from the other side of the quad. You know when you see charisma in someone - the atmosphere changes when they enter the room and you want to get to know them. I had signed up for the university's inter-college American football tournament. It was flag football, so instead of jumping on opponents to tackle them you have to pull a velcro flag off their belts. Booker had been a player of national standard in high school and then played for Stanford University, so was just the man to teach us the game. But he had a job on his hands, because we were dreadful. It turns out that a good American football team needs to have at least one player who can throw and one who can catch. We had Booker, who could do both, but that's not enough. We lost all of our games, but the preparation was extraordinary. He showed us a particular play, which he said Stanford had used to "whip Notre Dame's ass". The rivalry between the Fighting Irish and the Stanford Cardinals makes the annual game between them a grudge match. So it made for a surreal experience playing in the middle of a park in Oxford, using tactics that had been devised for a game played in front of 90,000 people. Before our first game, Cory gave us a team talk. Team talks are the bread and butter of great sporting films, but I'd never been on the receiving end of a proper motivational talk before. We all sat around him as he told us a story, about a time when he was playing college football and another player was questioning whether he wanted to win enough. I think it may even have been a player he admired from another team. In the denouement of the story, this enormous player sat on Cory's chest (and he's not a small chap himself), stopping him breathing. We were gripped by this narrative, as Cory, without raising his voice, gradually got to the point in the story where he was about to pass out and the other player told him that he would not be a great player until he wanted to win as much as he wanted to take a breath. It was extraordinary - I wanted to win that game more than I've wanted to do anything. In a pretty hopeless team, I was easily the worst player. But in a game that we lost, like all the others, I had my moment. I was playing on defence when the person I was supposed to be marking got many yards away from me and prepared to catch what would have been a touchdown pass. I ran and took a huge, goalkeeper-style dive and got my fingertips to the ball. I remember watching it dribbling over the sideline as I landed in a heap on the floor. Cory dragged me up from the ground with his hand over my eyes, so I could hear the shouting around me but not see the team. He generously described it as the greatest play he'd seen. I've played a lot of pub football and village green cricket since then and had some pretty exciting moments, but I would have no hesitation in describing that as the greatest sporting moment of my life. It's not because there was much at stake - I think we were already way behind in the game. It was exciting because of the atmosphere and motivation around the team that Cory had created. As mayor of Newark, Booker has been credited by his supporters for overseeing a drop in violent crime and reducing the city's budget deficit. But he also has a national profile thanks to his prolific and savvy media appearances. His clever use of social media was most notably demonstrated when he was tweeted by a woman whose elderly father needed help shovelling snow from his drive. After a brief exchange, Booker himself turned up at his home to offer a helping hand. On another occasion, he assisted one of his Twitter followers to propose to his girlfriend. An all-action reputation was sealed when he rescued a woman from a burning building and then a year later rescued a dog in frozen conditions. He also took in people temporarily homeless from Hurricane Sandy. But there have been bumps in the road. Eyebrows were raised when the 15-year-old son of CNN chief Jeff Zucker became an advisor at a tech start-up Booker co-founded with the help of some high-profile investors in Silicon Valley. Booker sold his stake in the firm last month. No such criticism at Oxford, where Cory had a great effect on Rabbi Shmuel Boteach, who was the representative in Oxford of the chasidic Jewish movement, Chabad-Lubavitch. He'd set up a rival Jewish Society for Oxford students called the L'Chaim Society. In practice, it was seen by students as a club for American post-graduates, which had very impressive speakers. But it was still quite a shock when Rabbi Boteach appointed Cory, a 6'3" black Baptist, to be president of the society. The rabbi said he'd given Cory the job because he was the best person he knew. Cory would give talks at the society's Friday night dinners about that week's Torah portion and apparently has been studying biblical tracts with Rabbi Boteach ever since. When Cory was running to be mayor of Newark, his opponents criticised him for not really wanting that job, saying that it was just a stepping stone to higher political dreams. It says a lot about him that in the Senate campaign, his opponents have been saying the same thing. Talking to other contemporaries from Queen's he seems to have been widely liked and admired. He volunteered for the charity Nightline, which gives emotional support to students, as well as doing some voluntary work in a school on the nearby Blackbird Leys estate. We were all wrong about him at college, though. We were convinced he'd be the first black president, and he missed that boat. But I wouldn't bet against him in a future race. </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can taking supplements actually harm your health?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <body>Where once politicians lined up to bash the bankers, now they line up to belt the "big six" - the nation's energy firms. Where once they promised to stop bonuses, now they pledge to curb gas and electricity bills. The question they know voters are asking is: can you really make a difference and if so how? The ministers' answer, for now, is greater transparency and competition. They're calling on companies to spell out precisely what is forcing them to hike their prices. Why - they ask - is British Gas blaming them for the rising costs of green schemes and subsidies for the poor when other companies can meet the same obligations for much less money? They're examining why it takes so long for people to change suppliers. Where once they criticised proposals to intervene in the market they now boast of moves to put some customers on the lowest available tariff. Not good enough, says Labour. They point out that only one in 10 customers benefited from that promise and say that the big six must be forced to re-structure and to have their prices frozen while they do. In truth politicians of all colours are having to grapple with not one energy crisis but three: rising bills, climate change and the very real threat of blackouts. It's easy to say that you'll cut bills at the same time as putting pressure on them to rise to pay for greener energy and greater investment in new power stations to stop the lights going out. If you're the politician who can convince voters you can actually do it you're on to a winner. </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Scotland's first minister has called on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Alex Salmond met representatives of operators Ineos and the Unite union on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices. The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK. Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%. The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland. Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase. "Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible. "Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency." </body>

      <body>A man has admitted biting off part of his cousin's ear in a row over a grave plot. Andrew Montgomery, 34, from Dundee, carried out the assault before chasing Dean Montgomery, who was clutching his severed lobe, down the street. The assault left the victim needing extensive reconstructive surgery to create a new ear as the detached part could not be saved. Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday. The court heard how the assault came after a family dispute over a grave plot - with various exchanges between family members over two weeks before the attack. Andrew Montgomery then approached his cousin on Dundee's Dens Road, on 30 July last year, and a fight broke out. Both men fell to the ground, with Dean Montgomery becoming aware that his accused was biting his ear. Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair said: "The accused had a grip of his ear in his teeth and the complainer was afraid to pull away, in case his ear became detached. "He was then aware of part of his ear falling to the ground. "He picked it up at this time and had it in his hand." Dean Montgomery then managed to get to his feet and ran back down Dens Road - towards Alexander Street. Miss Sinclair added: "The accused caught up with the complainer and knocked him to the ground and repeatedly punched him on the head and body." Members of the public who witnessed the attack then called police - with Andrew Montgomery making off in an orange Vauxhall Corsa. His cousin was taken to Dundee's Ninewells Hospital where he needed 24 stitches to his ear. The amputated part of the lobe was not deemed fit for re-attachment. Dean Montgomery then had to go through lengthy and painful reconstructive surgery to give him a new ear. The court was told that two rib cartilages were harvested from his chest and carved into the shape of the missing part of his ear. They were then covered with a skin flap taken from behind his other ear. Miss Sinclair submitted a victim impact statement to the court detailing the effect of the attack on Dean Montgomery. Andrew Montgomery pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge of assaulting his cousin, to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Jack Brown, defending, said there had been a long-standing family dispute and that Dean Montgomery "was not the shrinking violet in the impact statement". Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday for a full plea in mitigation to be heard from Andrew Montgomery's lawyer. </body>

      <title>Dentist suspended for nine months</title>
      <description>The owner of a chain of dental clinics is suspended for allowing 18 unqualified members of staff to give children unnecessary treatment.</description>

      <body>A dental tycoon who allowed unqualified staff to give children unnecessary treatment at clinics across the west of Scotland has been suspended. George Campbell, owner of the All 1 Smile chain of clinics, also repeatedly failed to check the qualifications of staff who carried out orthodontic work. He has practices in Glasgow, East Kilbride, Greenock, Cumbernauld, Hamilton and Kilmarnock. Campbell has been suspended for nine months following a tribunal. The General Dental Council (GDC) heard how Campbell had mistakenly extracted patients' healthy teeth and referred children for hospital surgery which they did not need. He was referred to the GDC in September 2011 following a series of complaints that were made about the treatment of 30 patients spanning over a decade. The tribunal was told that between July 2001 and August 2011, Campbell repeatedly referred children for unnecessary extraction and surgery. They also heard how he had failed to ensure staff were fully qualified, with up to 18 employees carrying out treatment before they had completed their orthodontic training. It was reported an employee had even provided orthodontic treatment without having any dental qualifications or training. Stewart Goulding, chair of the conduct and competence committee, who made the decision said: "There are a number of grave failings in his clinical practice highlighted by the findings. "There are, particularly in the areas of radiography, treatment planning and treatment undertaken, and his employment of unregistered and unqualified staff. "Taking these wide-ranging failings together with his departures from specific guidance and standards within the profession, the committee had little difficulty in determining that the facts found proved amounted to serious misconduct" Giving evidence, Campbell had told the GDC there was a lack of guidance from the regulatory body when it came to his newly-qualified staff. He said: "There was no real guidance or supervision so we always aimed to provide the training and guidance ourselves. "I was supervising new staff on a daily basis and with any queries on the supervision or tasks we would phone the GDC to check." Campbell had denied the bulk of the allegations against him at the hearing in London. A series of charges were not proven including a failure to ensure patient numbers could be adequately served at his clinics. </body>

      <body>A charity worker who stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable pensioners has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. Philip Muirhead, 36, from Aberdeen, went to Cuba and also bought a car using some of the money, after taking and cashing cheques from two people. He was working as an advocate at a support centre at Royal Cornhill Hospital. Muirhead admitted 10 charges of theft committed between 2008 and 2010 when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court The court heard he considered suicide after being caught. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said: "Mr Muirhead succumbed to temptation to dig himself out of financial difficulties. "There was a window of opportunity and he took that and he will regret it for the rest of his life. "His financial position unravelled during the time near the end of the offences although he admits that he did use some of the money for the car and the holiday." Mr Kelly added: "He panicked with regard to attending court. "He simply couldn't face up to reality - he had a clearly thought out a suicide plan and made his way to the Forth Road Bridge." Sheriff William Summers said: "You were employed in a position of trust and you abused that trust - that was shameless and despicable. "All the money you have stolen has been squandered. "These were not sophisticated thefts but they were carried out in an utterly deceitful and heartless way." </body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no". The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away. He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny". On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country". Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future. He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no. "And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country. "We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities. "They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract." The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland". He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector. Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself." At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant. He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. </body>

      <body>A watchdog has completed its investigation into a police force's handling of a complaint from the family of a man who died 16 years ago. Kevin McLeod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. His death was treated as accidental. His family claim officers were instructed by the procurator fiscal to treat it as potential murder. It is understood Police Scotland has now been asked to examine whether this was the case. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) confirmed it had completed its review of the family's complaint. A spokesperson said the commissioner had made a single recommendation. Police Scotland said it was considering the action recommended. Northern Constabulary, which was merged with other forces to form Police Scotland, treated Mr McLeod's death as accidental. His family, however, have consistently criticised the force over its investigation. Their most recent complaint centres on the claim that the procurator fiscal instructed the force to carry out a murder investigation. In 2007, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland (PCCS) said Northern Constabulary behaved with "institutional arrogance" in the way it handled earlier complaints from Mr McLeod's parents, Hugh and June McLeod. It ordered the then chief constable, Ian Latimer, to apologise in person to his relatives, which the senior officer did. Following the latest development, a spokeswoman for the PIRC said: "The commissioner's review of this case is now complete and a report has been sent to the family and Police Scotland. "The commissioner made a single recommendation in his report, which is for Police Scotland to implement." A police spokesperson said: "We have received the report from the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner and are currently considering the recommendation that has been made." </body>

      <body>Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond will publicly debate with key figures in the No to independence campaign, his deputy Nicola Sturgeon has said. But she added that the SNP leader remained keen to go head-to-head with Prime Minister David Cameron. Ms Sturgeon made her comments on the BBC's Daily Politics show. Mr Cameron dismissed suggestions that he should take part in a televised debate with Mr Salmond in the run up to the referendum next year. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, 2014, when they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil asked Ms Sturgeon if she could give a commitment that Mr Salmond would debate with new Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, and head of Better Together, Alistair Darling. She replied: "I am sure that between now and the referendum Alex Salmond will debate with both of those people and many others, making the positive case for independence. There is no issue or question about that." But Ms Sturgeon added: "The real question is why will David Cameron not agree to debate with Alex Salmond? What is he running scared of? That is the unanswered question. "I've already debated with Alistair Darling. I've debated with Michael Moore. Alex Salmond will debate with lots of people between now and the referendum, but the first and foremost point here is that there should be that debate between the first minister and the prime minister." Better Together claimed Ms Sturgeon's comments were a "U-turn". A spokesman said: "It is good news that Nicola Sturgeon has finally confirmed that Alex Salmond has backed down and will now have a live TV debate with Alistair Darling. Now that both sides have agreed, it's time for the campaigns to get on and make this happen." Mr Cameron made his position clear when he appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show last month. He told the broadcaster: "Alex Salmond wants the question to be about anything other than the question. "So he would like the debate to be the SNP versus the Tory Party or Scotland versus England. It's not - it's a debate between Scots. "What it should be is between Alistair Darling, leader of the No campaign, and Alex Salmond, leader of the Yes campaign." </body>

      <body>A man accused of causing a car crash in November 2011 which led to his father's death is too ill to stand trial. James Mowat, 47, of Croy, near Inverness, has missed a number of court dates because he is still in hospital. It is alleged that as a result of the smash his father, also called James, was fatally injured. At the High Court in Edinburgh, prosecutor Adrian Cottam said the Crown was deserting the case pro loco et tempore. This means the charges have been dropped but the case could still be brought back to court in the future. Mr Mowat suffered a stroke following the crash. He had been facing a charge of driving carelessly while unfit through drink or drugs, or an alternative charge which alleged his alcohol level was three and a half times the legal limit when he was driving carelessly. The indictment alleged that as a result of the crash on the B9091 Croy to Nairn road, near Clephanton, his father was fatally injured. Mr Mowat's car was said to have failed to take a bend, left the roadway and hit an embankment and a tree. He had also faced charges of failing to report the accident and possessing cannabis. </body>

      <body>A man has been charged with trying to lure children off the street and threatening to strip-search a boy. Alan Gallagher, 23, allegedly approached two girls aged nine and 10, placed a puppy in their arms and asked them to go to his house. Mr Gallagher denies two charges of breach of the peace, one of them sexually-aggravated. He was freed on bail at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court and faces trial at a later date. Mr Gallagher also faces a charge of approaching primary school children, claiming he was a policeman with a drugs-sniffer dog, and telling an 11-year-old boy he had been taking drugs and would have to strip-search him. The offences were alleged to have taken place in Newmilns, Ayrshire, between March and June this year. </body>

      <body>A mother-of-five who admitted storing drugs in her home to help her teenage son, after he was threatened in prison, has been jailed. The drugs were uncovered during a raid at Karen McCarthy's home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, on 1 November last year. Amphetamine and a class A drug similar to a substance known as STP were found, with a street value totalling £92,500. The 45-year-old was jailed for 18 months at the High Court in Edinburgh. The judge heard how police had obtained a warrant to search McCarthy's home in Mountblow, after a tip-off. The search uncovered bags and plastic containers of white paste and white powder among the family foodstuffs in the kitchen freezer. McCarthy, who pled guilty to being concerned in the supply of the drugs, had worked with a voluntary group trying to help people beat addiction. Judge Lord Burns said: "I appreciate you did not know exactly what it was." He added: "There is a strong public interest in dealing with people who join in the chain of supply, as you did, by providing a safe house." </body>

      <body>An island beer maker has announced plans to open a brewery, hotel and visitor centre on the mainland. Isle of Arran Brewery said the centre in the village of St Fillans, Perthshire, will cost at least £250,000 to develop and lead to about 20 jobs. The former Drummond Hotel will be converted into three restaurants, two bars and a shop, with hotel accommodation for up to 30 guests. The brewery aims to attract 30,000 visitors to the site in the first year. It wants the new facilities to complement its existing visitor centre in Brodick, Arran, which draws about 20,000 visitors annually. The new site is due to open at the start of next summer. Isle of Arran Brewery managing director Gerald Michaluk said: "The St Fillans site offers the brewery the chance to diversify and expand, producing a range of fresh and exciting brews in a new region of Scotland. "The new premises will be situated on a stunning site overlooking Loch Earn and we hope to add to the magic of St Fillans with some island charm." The St Fillans project is being part-financed by VisitScotland and Bank of Scotland to promote tourism before major events next year such as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup. Last year, the brewery bought Rosebank Distillery near Falkirk as part of expansion plans. The deeds of the site say it cannot be used for distilling until 2017 when a "micro-distillery" could be opened. </body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE. It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month. Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK. Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test. "In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote. Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE. Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle. The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal. Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided. The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal. He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation. </body>

      <body>Leading philanthropists from across the world have been recognised for their work at a special ceremony in the Scottish Parliament. Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter was among six people to receive the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. The medal is awarded biannually to those who use their private wealth and business acumen for public good. They were granted the award for their support for education, science, entrepreneurship and the arts. Sir Tom is only the second Scot to receive the award, after Kwik-Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer. Other recipients of the medal this year included the founder of the second largest telecoms business in Russia, Dr Dmitry Zimin. American hedge fund manager Dr James Harris Simons - along with his wife, economist Dr Marilyn Simons - also received medals, as did Dame Janet Wolfson de Botton on behalf of the Wolfson family, which set up the Wolfson Foundation. The foundation was named after Glasgow-born business leader and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson, who died in 1991. The daughter of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, accepted a medal on her mother's behalf. The ceremony has only been held outside the United States once before - also at the Scottish Parliament in 2005. In that same year, Sir Tom Hunter was knighted for services to entrepreneurship and philanthropy. The son of an Ayrshire shop owner, he started his first business selling sports shoes from the back of a van with a £5,000 loan from his father. He later built his Sports Division business into Europe's largest independent sports retailer and eventually sold it in 1998 for £290m. Sir Tom and his wife Lady Marion went on to establish The Hunter Foundation (THF). Previous medal recipients include the Rockefeller Family, the Gates Family, the Sainsbury Family, the Cadbury Family, George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Holyrood's Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "Earlier this week, the parliament opened an exhibition exploring the legacy of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy over the past 100 years. "Today, we welcomed modern philanthropists to our chamber, people who have followed in Carnegie's footsteps and used their wealth to make a positive difference to society. "I am sure Carnegie would have enjoyed today's ceremony and I hope the stories of the medallists will help inspire the next generation of philanthropists." This year's ceremony also marked the centennial of the establishment of the Carnegie UK Trust. The trust is named after Dunfermline-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie, whose family emigrated to the US from a life of poverty in Scotland in 1848. He made his fortune in steel, becoming the world's richest man, and eventually gave away billions of pounds to fund a network of global foundations. </body>

      <body>A couple who were caught with more than £100,000 worth of Class A drugs in their Midlothian home have been jailed. Lee Middlemass, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months and Jo-Anna Wallace, 21, for two years at the High Court in Edinburgh. The pair had previously pled guilty to offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A search of their home in Dalkeith in October 2012 found 1.3 kilos of cocaine, £7,195 in cash, a hydraulic press and other drug-making equipment. Wallace, 21, had asked the judge not to be separated from her baby daughter when, at an earlier hearing, she admitted being concerned in the supply of the drug. Unusually, judge Lord Pentland allowed her and partner Middlemass to remain on bail pending sentence, so they could spend more time with their three-month-old However, when the pair appeared for sentence the judge dismissed a plea to allow Wallace to do community service, saying the court would be failing in its duty. He said: "What sort of message would that send to society and, in particular, to persons further up the drug chain who might be tempted to prey on vulnerable individuals?" Sentencing the couple, Lord Pentland said the motive had been money. He said: "Neither of you seen to have taken into account the enormous damage Class A drugs cause in communities throughout the country." </body>

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <description>A national service based in Scotland which has saved hundreds of children has been recognised with an award.</description>

      <body>A national service which has saved the lives of hundreds of children has been recognised with an award. Yorkhill Hospital's Extracorporeal Life Support Service, or ECLS, has used the latest technology to treat almost 500 children, half of them newborn babies. The service was one of the first in the UK to see the potential of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, or 'ECMO' machines, to save lives. ECMO machines replace the function of the heart and lungs, giving medics a vital window of opportunity to treat patients who are seriously ill. The technology hit the headlines during the swine flu epidemic in 2009 when it was used to help those whose lungs were failing. Two year old Matthew Wilson was close to death when he was transferred to the service at just three hours old. He had breathed in fluid and faeces in the womb and his body couldn't absorb enough oxygen. "I was under general anaesthetic so I didn't actually see him when he was born," said his mum Clare Wilson, "but apparently he wasn't breathing." "They told me it was one of the worst cases they'd seen." Matthew was on an ECMO machine for five days. "Although it looks really horrific at the start, it does work," said dad Ian Wilson. "It was very scary but we saw he was on the mend and we grew more confident as the days went on." Matthew made a complete recovery. ECMO machines take blood from the body, usually via a cannula inserted directly into the heart by a cardiac surgeon, and oxygenate it before returning it to the body. Nearly half of a baby's entire volume of blood is oxygenated every minute. "Basically, it gives us time," said paediatric surgeon Carl Davis. "We can then make the baby better or the baby's body has time to get better. We can give antibiotics or physiotherapy to clear out meconium from the lungs, as Matthew had." So far ECMO machines have been used on 116 babies with the same condition as Matthew, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome. The survival rate is twice as high as would normally be expected, with 98% of babies recovering. Overall nearly 500 children with various conditions have been treated since the service was set up in 1992. Although many of these children are critically ill, the survival rate is 80%. The service is available to children all over Scotland, and is based at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children. It has been awarded an award for "Excellence in Life Support" by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation. "It's a team award," said Mr Davis. "We're striving for excellence and it's a huge team involving nurses, physios, profusionists and people in labs providing blood tests ...and I'll have forgotten a whole bunch of people who are also involved." </body>

      <body>Highland Council has formally submitted a planning application for its proposed Inverness West Link. Councillors on the local authority will be asked to consider the plans for the new road, which could cost up to £34m to construct. The council says the new road is needed to ease travel across Inverness and free up congested city centre streets. There has been local opposition to the preferred route because it would involve construction on green spaces. Highland Council has proposed creating new sports pitches and facilities as part of the West Link project. These could cost up to £9.5m to build. </body>

      <title>New survey on trouble-hit bypass</title>

      <body>Highland Council is running a survey of businesses and organisations affected by closures of the A890 Stromeferry bypass in Wester Ross. The eight mile (12km) stretch of road has been repeatedly shut by landslides. The council is examining several possible solutions. These include a tunnel, a bridge or for traffic to use a nearby railway when not in use. The survey seeks information on the reasons why companies and organisations rely on the bypass. Questions include how many employees use it to get to work and how important it is to firms for delivering goods. The bypass on the A890 in Wester Ross has been closed by large landslides in the last two years. The A890 helps to connect Lochcarron to Plockton, with its high school, and also to Kyle. The road links up from the A896, the main road through Lochcarron, and runs down the side of Loch Carron. When the bypass is closed, drivers face having to take a 140-mile (225km) diversion, instead of the usual 18 miles (29km) from Lochcarron to Plockton. It was shut for three days in December last year when almost 20 tonnes of debris came down. In December 2011, the bypass was shut by a landslip which involved 100 tonnes of rock. This left it blocked for four months and sparked a Highland Council investigation into how to prevent further disruption. A small car ferry, a pleasure cruiser and train services were all utilised in an effort to ease the travel headache for locals. Rubber mats were also later laid on a railway running alongside the bypass so road traffic could use the track. Highland Council is not expected to make a decision on a preferred permanent solution until next summer. </body>

      <body>Oil and Gas UK has commissioned new research into the economic contribution of the industry. The industry body has appointed EY to assess the billions of pounds the supply chain generates annually. Oil and Gas UK said the study would use data from more 1,000 companies, with the results expected to be released in March next year. UK Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said gaining further insight was important. He said: "The UK's oil and gas supply chain is highly robust with the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth over the coming decades. "Gaining even further insight into its strengths and capabilities will only help to support the ongoing work of our joint oil and gas industrial strategy to create new jobs, encourage investment and increase exports." Oil and Gas UK's business development director Stephen Marcos Jones said: "We have a world-leading global supply chain based here in the UK which we believe contributes £5-6bn every year to the Exchequer and exports £7bn worth of goods and services. "It is important we continue to make the UK an attractive place for these companies to stay." A recent report said a severe shortage in qualified staff will push the average wage in the oil and gas industry up by 15% this year to £73,600. The forecast came in a survey of more than 2,200 oil and gas companies by recruitment firm Oilandgaspeople.com. </body>

The kitten, thought to be about eight weeks old, was found at bins on Tedder Road with her bed, litter tray, food and toys in a cardboard box. The Scottish SPCA said the kitten - now called Nala - had been "terrified". A spokeswoman said: "Nala was on top of the box and the lady who contacted us said her paws were tangled up in the tape that had been used to seal it." The kitten is now being cared for at the charity's Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Drumoak. Senior animal care assistant Jacki Bell said: "Nala has been through a lot and she's understandably terrified.

      <body>Police have released the descriptions of three men and a van they hope to trace in connection a missing sculpture that is said to be worth £3m. The bronze piece by Henry Moore which was stolen from the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead. Police said a blue Ford Transit-style van and its three occupants were seen at the park on two occasions before the artwork was taken last week. The men have been described as being in their 20s or 30s. Police Scotland said they were of average height and build. One had ginger, shaven hair and was wearing a red or orange waterproof jacket. The men had a collie-type dog and the van was described as being of an unusual shade of blue. Police said the men may have had legitimate business in the area and have appealed for them to contact the force. Det Insp Colin Burnie, the officer leading the enquiry, said Police Scotland was "delighted" with the public response to the investigation. He added: "We now require further help to identify this blue van and occupants and would again ask the public to call us if they have any information which may help us." The missing sculpture, called the Standing Figure, is believed to be worth up to £3m according to police. It was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park. The remaining major pieces at the site have since been moved into secure storage for their safety. Standing Figure is among a number of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years. Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46. </body>

      <body>Renewable energy developer RES UK has welcomed a decision by the Scottish government to clear its plans for a wind farm in the Scottish Borders. RES had lodged an appeal over its 15-turbine Penmanshiel wind farm plans after a dispute with the local council. The company claimed Scottish Borders Council failed to decide on the firm's application within required timescales. The project was cleared after RES cut the number of turbines to 14 on visual impact grounds. Last year, Scottish Borders Council said it would "vigorously defend" the RES appeal. The company maintained the project had been in planning for nearly a year without a decision being made by the council. However, a council spokesman said at the time that RES had not responded to requests to adjust its plans. RES said on Wednesday that Penmanshiel would make an important contribution to Scotland's energy targets and deliver significant benefits to the local community. Project manager Ruth Elder said: "We are delighted with the positive decision made by the Scottish government today and we are pleased that through the removal of one turbine the project has been allowed to proceed." RES said the local community at Penmanshiel would receive a benefits package of £5,000 per installed megawatt once the wind farm is operational. </body>

      <title>UK inmates lose right to vote ruling</title>
      <description>Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch lose their UK Supreme Court battle over the right to vote while in jail.</description>

      <body>The Supreme Court has dismissed appeals from two prisoners over the right to vote under European Union rules. Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch had argued that EU law gave them a right to vote - even though they cannot under British law. Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that the ruling was "a great victory for common sense". The European Court of Human Rights has previously told the UK to end the blanket ban on prisoners voting. Parliament is considering legislation, but has not yet decided what to do. Following the Supreme Court's judgement, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said: "Critically it ruled that EU law did not provide an individual right to vote, paralleling that recognised by the ECHR. Eligibility under EU law is a matter for national parliaments." Convicted prisoners in the UK are banned from voting on the basis that they have forfeited that right by breaking the law and going to jail. Successive governments have wanted to maintain that position but the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said a blanket ban on prisoners voting was disproportionate. Peter Chester raped and strangled his niece in Blackpool in 1977 and was jailed for life for her murder. He has served his minimum term but the Parole Board has refused to release him because it says he is too dangerous. In 2008, he tried to join the electoral roll so that he could vote in the elections for the European Parliament. The Ministry of Justice said he could not until the law was changed. In the second case, George McGeoch, serving life in a Scottish prison, argued that EU law allowed him to vote in local and European elections. Although the ECHR has already told the UK to change the law, these two cases focused on whether prisoners as EU citizens have a right to vote even if Westminster says differently. Last year, the government conceded that it would have to change the law to allow some prisoners to vote. Ministers have published a draft bill which is being considered by Parliament. The proposals include limiting the vote to inmates who are serving either less than six months or four years. A further 2,352 inmates have tried to bring voting cases to the European Court of Human Rights. Those applications are adjourned while judges wait to see what Westminster does. </body>

      <body>A man who committed sexual offences on children for 22 years has been sent to prison. Paul Angus, 57, was found guilty of 15 charges including three rapes, attempted rape, sexual assault and indecency. The judge ordered that he serve at least five and a half years in prison before he can ask for parole. He will remain under supervision and on the sex offenders register for the remainder of his life. During an earlier three-week trial Angus claimed he was innocent and that his accusers were conspiring against him. Eight girls ranging from eight to 16 were attacked at various locations in and around Dundee. They were assaulted between December 1988 and May 2010. None of the victims can be named for their protection. The court had heard how three of the girls were plied with drink before Angus made them perform sex acts. He was also found guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice by contacting one of his rape victims on 14 April last year by text message and attempting to persuade her not to contact police. Lord Burns said: "You used emotional blackmail which is truly despicable." After the trial last December, Lord Burns ordered in-depth reports to pave the way for a life sentence. An earlier hearing had to be cancelled at the last minute because Angus was taken to hospital complaining of chest pains. The judge noted that Angus had "groomed" the eight girls and appeared to have no appreciation of the effects his abuse had on them. He said: "You took advantage of them for your own depraved purposes." Lord Burns warned Angus that he would only be released when it is considered he no longer poses a risk. </body>

      <description>The impact of changes to housing benefit are raised by First Minister Alex Salmond in talks with Prime Minister David Cameron.</description>

      <body>The impact of changes to housing benefit has been raised by First Minister Alex Salmond in talks with Prime Minister David Cameron. The leaders were meeting at the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in Downing Street, involving devolved administrations and the UK government. Mr Salmond said the "insanity" of the so-called bedroom tax was evident. New Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said it was clear there was a difference of views. The JMC meeting comes on the eve of the SNP's conference in Perth and less than a year before the referendum on Scottish independence. Mr Salmond raised the issue of the removal of the spare room subsidy, described by critics as the ''bedroom tax'', as well as youth unemployment and lottery funding. The meeting, chaired by the prime minister, also focused on the economy and illegal immigration as well as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup, both being held in Scotland next year. Ahead of the talks, the first minister told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "There's a subject on the agenda called hot political issues and I can't think of anything hotter than the bedroom tax at the present moment. "The insanity of the charge is becoming ever clearer by the day." Mr Salmond called for a review of the policy's impact and an indication of whether discretionary housing payments to mitigate its impact would continue next year. After the talks he said no agreement was reached on the reforms, adding: "The way to agree on the 'bedroom tax' is to get it reversed." Mr Carmichael, who also attended, had urged Mr Salmond not to take a negative approach and said he should be prepared to listen and learn. Mr Salmond said Lib Dem and Labour criticism of his views on the benefit changes was an example of other parties working in co-ordination with the Conservatives. Mr Carmichael told BBC Scotland that Mr Salmond must accept that there would be real problems in an independent Scotland running welfare reform and benefit payments. He said: "The question of a review is one where in fact I think we are rather ahead of the curve because the deputy prime minister announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the government itself is having a review of this, and indeed we review all policies as they go along." The Scottish secretary said difficult decisions had to be made to cut the deficit but if it was shown there were difficulties being caused by housing benefit changes the government would deal with them. Mr Carmichael said: "We always knew that this was going to be a very difficult policy to implement and we can see the obvious difficulties that come with it - we're not blind to that, I see it in my own constituency - that's why we've already put an enormous amount of money directly into local authorities so they can protect those that are going to be most vulnerable to the changes." Meanwhile, Labour's shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran, accused the Scottish government of "grandstanding". She said: "Prices are rising faster than wages, energy bills are still going up and the bedroom tax is continuing to hit people across the country. "This is a rare opportunity to hammer out a plan to get to grips with this cost-of-living crisis. "Instead of coming to London to tell David Cameron to bin the bedroom tax, Alex Salmond should be laying out a plan to stop it hitting Scots." Also attending the meeting were the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, leaders of the Welsh and Northern Irish governments, Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop and Scottish Youth Employment Minister Angela Constance. </body>

      <body>Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead has asked the UK government to allow him to lead negotiations for Britain at crucial European quota talks, BBC Scotland has learned. It comes after last week's reshuffle by David Cameron saw George Eustice replace Richard Benyon as the UK fisheries minister. Mr Lochhead said it would be unfair to ask the new minister to head the talks. Allowable days at sea and mackerel quotas are among the main issues. Mr Lochhead said: "I will be doing everything I can to secure a favourable outcome for Scotland's fishermen." The EU fisheries council talks begin in Luxembourg on Thursday. Meanwhile, Scottish fishing industry leaders have welcomed "productive" talks with Mr Eustice and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) said the talks with the politicians covered a range of issues. These included the mackerel dispute with Iceland and the Faroe Islands. SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The meeting with Mr Eustice provided an early opportunity to brief the minister on the importance of the autumn negotiation period for the pelagic fleet. "We stressed to Mr Eustice that newly-released mackerel scientific advice demonstrated that the stock was in robust health and that the UK should not feel pressurised into securing a deal which jeopardised the future of the UK pelagic fleet. " He added: "We also had a very useful briefing session with Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael, who expressed his full support for our industry." Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, replaced Michael Moore as secretary of state for Scotland in the recent reshuffle. </body>

      <body>Employment in Scotland has reached its highest level for five years, according to the latest official figures. Employment rose by 37,000 over the three months to August, and now stands at 2,548,000. The number of unemployed Scots fell by 3,000 to 201,000 over the summer period. Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the Scottish jobless rate at 7.3%, which is below the average of 7.7% for the whole of the UK. The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 in the June-August period to 2.49 million. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA) in Scotland fell by 3,500 from August to 121,800 in September. The total was down by 18,200 on September 2012. The labour market statistics were released as figures showed that the Scottish economy grew for the fourth successive quarter, with growth of 0.6% during April to June. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael described the labour market figures as "very encouraging". He said: "We continue to work hard to create the right conditions for sustained long-term employment in Scotland. "As part of the UK, Scotland gains from tax reductions such as the new employment allowance of £2,000 per year, benefiting 70,000 businesses in Scotland by £100m in total, and taking 35,000 businesses out of employer national insurance contributions altogether." Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also welcomed the latest figures. He said: "These positive figures highlight the significant economic progress being made in Scotland. "While times remain challenging, Scotland's economy has grown faster than the UK over the last year to quarter two, with employment now at a five-year high and the economy growing for the fourth consecutive quarter. "On figures for employment, unemployment, inactivity and youth employment Scotland continues to perform better than the UK as a whole, with the employment rate amongst our young people continuing to be the highest of all UK nations." Scottish Labour's deputy finance spokeswoman, Jenny Marra, described the latest data as "encouraging" but argued that the Scottish government must demonstrate its commitment to long-term economic recovery "rather than gloating over minor shifts in the numbers each month". She added: "Over the last year there's been very little overall movement in the employment figures, except we know that more young people are out of work for longer and there's more women now looking for jobs." Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said the labour market figures showed "continued optimism" for Scotland's workforce. She added: "This economic indicator provides a welcome sign that the economy is heading in the right direction and businesses across Scotland should be commended for their efforts in creating and sustaining jobs. "These figures provide us with comfort, however we must not become complacent in our mission to revive Scotland's economy." Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "Despite modest improvements on a couple of indicators, including youth unemployment, the picture in Scotland is essentially one of 12-month stagnation in the employment market and some worrying trends on women's unemployment. "The improvement in long-term unemployment trends is a slightly surprising but welcome trend which we hope will continue." </body>

      <body>Business confidence is rising across all sectors in Scotland but the economic recovery remains frail, a survey of firms has suggested. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found manufacturing orders rose in the third quarter at their highest rate for six years. Manufacturers and retailers also forecast a rise in profitability in the first half of next year. But SCC warned it was "by no means yet certain" the recovery can be sustained. On Wednesday, figures released by the Scottish government indicated Scotland's economy grew by 0.6% between April and June this year - the fourth consecutive quarter of growth north of the border. Labour market statistics also showed employment in Scotland at its highest level for five years. SCC's latest business survey, which is conducted in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, found employment trends improving in all main sectors in the third quarter of 2013. Manufacturing orders also rose at their highest rate since the third quarter of 2007. Construction orders on balance declined, but levels remained higher than during the same period a year ago. The survey also suggested the long-term decline in retail sales had ended. The good summer boosted visitors to Scottish hotels, with more than half of businesses reporting a rise in guests. SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest survey showed "welcome signs of growth" for Scotland's economy. She said: "Compared to a year ago, business confidence has increased and all business trends in all sectors are stronger, showing positive steps towards sustained economic growth. "There are encouraging signs of increased consumer activity, with improving retail sales and stronger tourism trends. This is good news for Scotland and for Scotland's businesses. "The manufacturing sector has seen orders rise at the highest rate since 2007, construction respondents reported a rise in investment intentions and the long-term decline in retail sales ended, with retailers reporting increased optimism for the first time since 2006." She added: "However, economic vulnerability remains. "Much depends on continuing positive trends in our major export markets and on speedy resolution of any remaining US fiscal issues. "Importantly, prices and wages remain disconnected and so household incomes continue to be squeezed. "This creates risk in reliance on a consumer-driven economy, which is why government rhetoric about investment and sustainability needs to become a reality to enable continued growth and confidence." </body>

      <body>Oil firm Cairn Energy has announced it is to start a year-long "high impact" exploration programme, with drilling to begin soon in Morocco. The company said the move would offer shareholders "exposure to material growth potential". A number of possible follow-up exploration prospects have also been mapped. Cairn said that a decision would be made soon on whether to drill the Pitu prospect off Greenland next year. The Edinburgh-based group's drilling programme in Greenland has so far been unsuccessful and has been strongly criticised by environmentalists. In a statement to the stock exchange, Cairn said that it remained in a "strong financial position ready to enter an intense operational period on the exploration front". Chief executive Simon Thomson said: "Cairn continues to follow its policy of maintaining appropriate balance sheet strength as it progresses its exploration and development programmes." The company also announced it would begin a share buy back programme of up to $300m (£186m). Cairn got shareholder approval for the move earlier in the year. </body>

      <body>Rangers fans will welcome the departure of Craig Mather as chief executive, Supporters' Association general secretary Drew Roberton believes. Mather resigned two days after losing a court case that forced the League One club to postpone their annual meeting. "The fans were unhappy at the way the club was going and the financial performance," said Roberton. "And they weren't convinced the current board, including Craig Mather, were the right people to take the club forward." Rangers were forced to delay their AGM because they had failed to include on the agenda a request by shareholders for the election of four new board members. And the departure of Mather, who had been in charge for six months, along with non-executive director Bryan Smart, was announced to the stock exchange. "In light of the court judgement, he has clearly made a serious error of judgement as far as the AGM notices go and his position, I would say, was untenable and he's fallen on his own sword," Roberton suggested to BBC Scotland. The association general secretary thought that change was needed in light of a loss of £14m reported for the last financial year. "It had to happen because clearly things did not appear to be going very well financially at the club judging from the accounts that have just been raised and everyone believed that change was needed," said Roberton. "The club, for whatever reason, tried to block that change. "I do believe that the requisitioners do have the best interests of Rangers at heart and I'm sure they'll appoint a top-quality chief executive to run the club. "I've spoken to Paul Murray and Malcolm Murray on previous occasions and I have no doubt whatsoever that they have the best interests of Rangers Football Club at heart." Former Rangers director Dave King, the Scottish businessman who has settled a tax dispute in South Africa, had been suggested as a future chairman after talks with Mather. "I think there might be a bit of a mixed reaction with Dave King," suggested Roberton. "But, on the other hand, Dave King is certainly in a position to put investment into the club and people would hope that, should Dave King return in any capacity to the board, he would perhaps make a significant investment in the club." Following the financial meltdown that led to Rangers playing in Division Three last season and boardroom battles that also resulted in the departure of Mather's predecessor, Charles Green, Roberton hopes the Glasgow club can now find some stability. Bus tycoon James Easdale and finance director Brian Stockbridge remain on the Rangers International Football Club plc board, while Easdale's brother, Sandy, is also on the football club board. "We would just like to see it all settle down and start making on-the-field headlines instead of off-the-field headlines and see the club on a stable financial footing for the future," added Roberton. "I just really hope that, between the Easdales and Mr Stockbridge, they arrange the AGM as soon as is reasonably practical and we can move on" </body>

      <body>Celtic captain Scott Brown has been given a three-game European ban by Uefa following his red card in the Champions League defeat by Barcelona. Referee Stephane Lannoy dismissed Brown after he appeared to aim a kick at Barca forward Neymar. The ban would make the 28-year-old unavailable for both games against Ajax and the visit of AC Milan. "The club finds this to be excessive and they will be appealing against the decision," said Celtic in a statement. The next Champions League game Brown would be available for is the final Group H fixture against Barcelona at the Nou Camp. Celtic are bottom of the group having lost their opening two matches, while Ajax have one point going into their trip to Glasgow on Tuesday. Following the 1-0 home loss to Barca, Brown admitted he had "made a mistake" but felt the red card was "harsh". </body>

      <body>Glasgow City set up a Champions League tie against Arsenal with a 3-1 second-leg victory over Standard Liege for a 5-3 Round of 32 aggregate win. The home side took the lead through an Aline Zeler own goal before Denise O'Sullivan gave City a two-goal lead in the opening half-hour. Right winger Sarah Crilly added a third midway through the second half, before Tessa Wullaert scored a consolation. Arsenal beat Kazakhstan's CSHVSM-Kairat 11-1 for an 18-2 aggregate victory. Glasgow head coach Eddie Woleckie Black said: "This is as good a result as we've had in Europe. "The pressure was on us here, but after criticising the team for some aspects of their play last week I couldn't fault them tonight. "It took a lot of effort, but we've beaten a very good side and it was a thoroughly deserved win." Glasgow were in control from the start on their rain-drenched Petershill Park pitch and never looked back after taking a 15th-minute lead. Zeler turned the ball into her own net under pressure from Suzanne Mulvey as the striker chased a pass from midfielder O'Sullivan. The Belgian side hit back, with midfielder Sanne Schoenmaker driving a 15-yard shot wide of the post. But Glasgow went close again when midfielder Jess Fishlock fired in an 18-yard shot that was well saved by the diving Sabrina Broos. And the Women's Scottish Premier League champions doubled their lead on the half-hour mark as O'Sullivan volleyed home a cross from Crilly. It was almost 3-0 two minutes into the second half as Crilly sent a looping volley against the crossbar. But the winger was not to be denied in the 56th minute when she bagged the third goal with a superb 18-yard drive that flew into the roof of the net. That left the visitors a massive task to claw their way back into the game, but they made a valiant attempt. Left winger Julie Biesman forced a goal-line save from keeper Lee Alexander, who then had to dive to turn aside a good effort from Wullaert. Alexander did well to deny Wullaert again as the striker broke clear six minutes from time. But Wullaert finally found the net two minutes into stoppage time, shooting home from left back Faustine Cartegnie's low cross. For Arsenal, striker Danielle Carter scored four goals and midfielder Kim Little hit a hat-trick - including two penalties. Their onslaught came in the second half after leading 4-0 at the break through Carter, Ellen White, Little's first penalty and a Jordan Nobbs effort. Seven goals then followed in a convincing 31 minutes after the break. Carter and Little completed their tallies, while Nobbs struck a second and substitute Caroline Weir also got her name on the scoresheet. Midfielder Makhliyo Sarikova scored Kairat's consolation goal a minute into stoppage time. Arsenal boss Shelley Kerr said of the meeting with Glasgow: "Since the draw was made everybody in Scotland seems to have been desperate for this game to happen. "Glasgow have proved what a good side they are for a long time now and I'm not surprised they've made it though to the last 16. "It will be a tough tie for us, but we'll prepare for it as professionally as we would to face any team and we'll focus on ourselves. "The fact that I'm Scottish is not an issue - my responsibility is to manage Arsenal and I'll be trying to manage them into the last eight." </body>

      <description>Mark Dodson says Scottish Rugby is "not frightened" of the prospect of planned changes to European club competition.</description>

      <body>Chief executive Mark Dodson insists Scottish Rugby is "not frightened of meritocracy" amid plans to change how clubs qualify for European competition. The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next year, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with the Heineken Cup. But Dodson insists strong performances in the Pro12 are key to Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh's participation. "We believe if Edinburgh finished 11th last year, they should not be involved in the Heineken Cup," said Dodson. "When I first came here, I said I would focus on professional rugby as well as the international team. "The targets we have been setting for both Glasgow and Edinburgh are for them both to be in the top four of the RaboDirect Pro12. "So for us to say we are against meritocracy would be crazy because our ambitions are to be challenging in the Rabo every year." English and French clubs object to the current Heineken Cup qualification criteria and the way revenue is shared. As things stand, Glasgow and Edinburgh are automatically entered to the competition. The new tournament could include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's endorsement. "What we would like to do is ensure that there is a rounded and fair solution," added Dodson. "We are prepared to look at meritocracy and some of the other tweaks that might need to be made to allow that to happen. "But don't let anyone be under any doubt, we are working very hard to make this work. "There has to be give and take. It can't be all take or it won't work. "We understand, we need to modernise and I have some sympathy with the English clubs' predicament. But they are working with a mix of models. "It doesn't work only the way the French and English leagues work. The Celtic and Italian clubs are run in a fundamentally different way." </body>

      <body>Here in Perth for the annual conference of the SNP, their last such event before next September's referendum. Historic. Challenging. But some things never change - and so it was that the opening event was, as is customary, a challenge to the agenda from Gerry Fisher, a splendid constitutionalist within a party which is not short of such beings. Gerry has been protesting about conference arrangements for as long as I have been attending as a journalist. (I would call him a veteran but he would have something else to say about me.) Today his appeal to reinstate a motion (drafted by Fisher, G.) was dismissed on the grounds that he was merely restating existing party policy. Exit Gerry, sad but unbowed. Conference immediately moved to debate a resolution which restated party policy as being in favour of independence. Indeed, there was so little prospect of dissent that one speaker, Linda Fabiani, voiced her pleasure at the absence of stress. It was, you will be astonished to learn, passed nem con. Still, mustn't grumble (although Gerry Fisher would undoubtedly challenge me on that one.) Unanimity is not unknown at other conferences. Plus, and this may astonish you further, the Nationalists actually believe in independence. They do not propose the repeal of the Union out of badness. Little wonder, then, that they seek to project their key objective at their own conference. However, there was time today for other topics. There was a debate on developing a sensible work/life balance. From the chair, Derek Mackay chirpily reminded delegates that such luxury would only apply to them after they had pounded the streets incessantly up to and including 18 September next year. As if to remind them of the challenge, a clock above the platform ticked steadily down to the opening of referendum polling. Alex Salmond needs no such reminder, on either count. As First Minister, his work/life balance is frequently disturbed. And so it was today that, straight after opening conference, he headed back to Edinburgh to hold talks on the challenge facing the Grangemouth petrochemical complex. Mr Salmond reflected the grave nature of that challenge in his opening remarks. He had, he said, studiously avoided the temptation of making political capital from a dispute whose origins lie, at least in part, in internal Labour Party deliberations. Further, he stressed that government could not, either in Edinburgh or London, will a settlement nor order a deal. That was down to the unions and the company. But he noted that, in separate interviews on different channels, both sides had voiced hope that Grangemouth had a strong future. In essence, he argued, let it be. Then Mr Salmond turned to independence. As anticipated, his argument operated on distinct levels. The audience in the hall needed no convincing (see above.) And so his message was aimed at the sceptical outside the hall, around Scotland. He made a series of basic points. That there was a "natural majority" for independence on the basis that most Scots appeared to favour the transfer to Holyrood of most key powers. That this natural majority was depressed (arithmetically) by disquiet over the economy, stirred, he suggested, by the advocates of Union. That Nationalists could steadily counter this disquiet. That Scotland faced a choice of two futures: full self-government or continued partial rule from Westminster whereby policies such as the so-called bedroom tax would be intrinsic. It was a taster of arguments to come at this conference, from Nicola Sturgeon tomorrow and from Mr Salmond in his main address on Saturday. </body>

      <body>The bitter industrial dispute which has broken out at Grangemouth has placed a spotlight on the giant refinery and petrochemicals complex. So what is the history behind the site, who runs it now and what operations are carried out there? When did the site start up? In 1924, BP opened a refinery on the Firth of Forth, in part because of its transport links and the availability of local labour skilled in shale oil refining. From the 1950s, BP's operations there grew to meet growing demand for both petrochemicals and fuels. The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil in the 1970s brought further business to the site. The refinery's feedstock is now mainly supplied by the neighbouring BP-operated Kinneil oil and gas processing plant. Some oil is imported to the site via pipeline from the deepwater Finnart Ocean Terminal, located about 60 miles west of Grangemouth. Who owns the complex? The petrochemicals part of the 1,700-acre site is run by Switzerland-based speciality chemicals and oil product manufacturer Ineos. It owns more than 50 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries across the world. In late 2005 Ineos bought BP's olefins and derivatives business, taking over the Grangemouth complex in the process. The crude oil refinery - the only one in Scotland - is now owned by Petroineos, a joint venture which was formed between Ineos and PetroChina International (London) Company in 2011. What is produced at Grangemouth? The Grangemouth refinery processes around 210,000 barrels of crude oil per day, producing more than nine million litres of clean fuels per day. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides fuel to Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The refinery and chemical plants form Ineos' largest production centre. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year. These are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. What major equipment is there at the complex? At the heart of the petrochemicals site are two ethylene crackers - G4 and KG - which produce the feed materials used by other chemicals plants. The two units have an ethylene production capacity of one million tonnes per year between them. </body>

      <title>Tough tactics at Grangemouth</title>
      <description>What's behind the bitter dispute at Grangemouth?</description>

      <body>The industrial dispute at Grangemouth has the feel of the 1980s about it; robust confrontation, provocation and bitter mutual denunciations. The energy complex's operator, Ineos, has made clear it can be ruthless, as it did earlier this month when it simply and permanently closed down a fairly new chemicals plant in Hull. It was keen that workers at Grangemouth got that message. They surely got the message this week. Their strike threat is bringing about a total shutdown, rather than the "hot stand-by" the union says would be adequate: "It's shut down and it remains shut". Put on the back foot, the hardball tactics of Ineos forced Unite the union into cancelling its strike plan, without any achievements and with no agreement on any of the issues in dispute. They next face a demand for concessions on pay, conditions, pensions and possibly job losses. They get this weekend to think about it, with a reply expected by Monday. And on Tuesday, the owners of Grangemouth decide if they've got the cost-cutting they demand. By owners, that mainly means Jim Ratcliffe, who built up Ineos in only 15 years to become a global chemicals giant, fuelled by mind-boggling amounts of debt. His bondholders will take part in deliberations too. The stakes are high. There's a look of real alarm from government ministers in London and Edinburgh at the implications of the shut-down of the twin refinery and petro-chemical plant. They are keen not to repeat the fuel disruption which led to panic buying and shortages in the past. So you're told not to worry about petrol and diesel supplies. There are stockpiles, and arrangements have been made to ship in fuel for transfer to road tankers. But there's a longer-term and more fundamental risk to the Scottish economy from the Ineos shut-down. And it's an imminent risk. While Ineos threatened the petro-chemical plant may shut before the end of 2017, no-one from Ineos was able to tell me on Wednesday that it will definitely open again after shareholders review their position next week. The refinery is in a more secure position, even though we've been told the closure of the petro-chemical plant, which uses the gas by-products from the refining process, would make the finances of the refinery more difficult. And the relative security of the refinery is not just because it appears to be in a relatively strong financial position: it's also that it's half-owned by Petro-China. We've yet to hear what they think about this very un-Chinese dispute, but that humongous corporation (it's market value is nearly £150bn) will surely have an interest in the shareholder meeting next Tuesday. The further risk to the economy is that a huge complex of offshore oil and gas production platforms pump their output down the pipeline to Grangemouth. That pipe is, in turn, operated by steam and cooling gases from Grangemouth. Alex Salmond said on Wednesday that supply is secure, which should mean the pipeline stays open. But if this shut-down drags on, for how much longer before the constraints of crude storage require production to halt upstream? And as it's focussing minds of ministers in two governments, here's another question to which I still await an answer: do they have any legal powers over the owners of such a vital strategic asset, if that owner is determined to close it down? Much of this dispute pivots on the claim by Ineos that it's losing around £10m per month, and nearly £600m over the past four years. It says it's in a "distressed" condition. Wrong, says Unite. The union asked a tax accountant to test out the assertion. Richard Murphy, a campaigner on tax reform and an adviser to the Trades Union Congress, has concluded that Ineos is in rather rude health. He suggests they've thrown a number of exceptional items at last year's accounts, which mean it doesn't look good. And he argues that a £117m allowance for deferred tax implies that there's around £500m of profit still to be made. But he also admits that Ineos' accounts are hard to find, let alone to fathom. There are dozens of firms registered under the Ineos brand, and a spokesman confirms that there's no straight-forward way of assessing the Grangemouth plant, amid numerous intra-company sales and loans. It doesn't help with clarity that the parent company moved out of Britain to Switzerland. That was its response when the UK Treasury turned down a request to defer a VAT bill when Ineos was in financial difficulties with the onset of the downturn. Ineos stresses that its auditors, PwC, have confirmed the extent of its problems, though it's yet to open its books to confirm the small glimpse that press release shows us. It seems odd, at least, that capital expenditure is counted as part of the loss that Ineos says it's making. In any case, the complexities of its finances matter rather less when the Ineos management has ensured that its workforce is focussed rather more intently on the survival of the plant, and of their jobs, past this weekend. </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>The BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme is appealing for members of the public to join an audience for its next debate on issues associated with the independence referendum. The programme makers want to hear what you think about Higher and Further Education in Scotland. They also want to know your opinions on the way universities and colleges operate, their funding, admissions policy and research resourcing. Do you think independence would be good or bad for post-school education in Scotland? Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector? If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below. The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30. Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views. To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" </body>

      <title>Connecting children to the great outdoors</title>
      <description>Are Scottish children more connected to nature?</description>

      <body>A report published by the RSPB has suggested that children in Scotland are more connected to nature than those in the rest of the UK. The research measured young people's enjoyment of the outdoors; how at one they felt with nature; their empathy for creatures; and their environmental responsibility. But at a half-term play scheme being held at the RSPB's Loch Leven reserve the children were more concerned about having fun. Craig Leitch showed them how to build a den, then the group of twelve - aged between six and 12 - split up and started building their own shelters. Boys and girls talked about how you could imagine you were surviving in the woods, or that you were a woodland animal building yourself a new home. One lad told me if he was at home he'd have been playing a computer game. He enjoyed that, of course. But on balance he would rather be out and about in the great outdoors. It was fun, and good exercise, he said. Younger children - the youngest just weeks old - went on a magical walk through the trees, looking for woodland elves and forest fairies. Then Judy Paul showed them, and their mums and dads, how to light a fire so they could toast marshmallows, bananas or potato scones. One parent explained that it was "too easy just to sit indoors and watch TV." But taking part in events at the reserve meant they could enjoy the woods with an experienced person who knows about the trees and the wildlife. Another mum agreed. "It's just a fantastic experience learning about the plants and the flowers, the outdoors experience, and socialising with other children their own age," she explained. Rebekah Stackhouse, who runs RSPB Scotland's education and youth programmes, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the results of the research in Scotland, which was carried out by the University of Essex over a three-year period, had been encouraging. "Twenty seven per cent of young people in Scotland are highly connected to nature," she said. "That's absolutely brilliant news, and it reflects the number of organisations and families that are doing stuff in the outdoors already. "But the important thing to remember is that it is only a quarter. So it would be much better if we could get that number up to 50%, or all young people in Scotland being connected to nature." The research was commissioned by the RSPB amid concern that generations of children had little or no contact with the natural world. The RSPB hopes that now a baseline figure has been established, the research can be repeated in future to see what practical difference public polices are making to young people's experience. It is claimed that contact with nature is good for children's education, physical health, and emotional wellbeing. </body>

      <body>The Scotsman reports that Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has demanded urgent talks after the operator of Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant warned the site had "shut and will remain shut" unless unions pledge not to strike this winter. But the Herald says motorists have been told that contingency measures are in place to prevent garage forecourts running dry of fue The Courier describes how the Unite union accused Ineos, which operates the plant, of "economic vandalism". The Scottish Sun says Prime Minister David Cameron was "roasted" for calling on Scottish fans to support England at next year's World Cup, under the headline "Brazil Nut". Craig Mather quit as chief executive of Rangers with a year's salary - £300,000 - in his pocket, claims the Daily Record. The Press and Journal describes how lifeline flights between Inverness and the Western Isles were seriously disrupted because of a shortage of air traffic controllers. </body>
