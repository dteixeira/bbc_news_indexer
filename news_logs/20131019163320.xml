      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>Salmond to publish Yes case paper</title>
      <description>The Scottish government will publish its detailed case for independence on 26 November, Alex Salmond annouces at the SNP conference.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government will publish its detailed case for independence on 26 November, Alex Salmond has said. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond told the SNP conference that a vote for independence would be "an act of national self belief". Scotland's first minister said devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told delegates in Perth that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." </body>

      <body>Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has responded to criticism of his commission to improve the England team by stressing he is still keen to recruit black and ethnic members. Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up. Dyke admitted a "mistake" in announcing only part of the line-up. But he added: "To suggest we never considered the ethnic balance of the commission is unfair." Jamaica-born Rabbatts, 57, wrote to Dyke and fellow board members to complain about "a lack of diversity", saying she had no choice but to go public as there had been a "refusal to understand" her position in private. In an open letter, the FA chairman said he planned to appoint further members to the eight-strong group. Dyke wrote: "The make-up of the commission has been moving for some time, but I did explain to you and the board that we planned to appoint two or three additional members and would have done so this week had the issue of Roy Hodgson's dressing room comments not blown up." The eight names announced for the commission are Dyke, FA vice-chairman Roger Burden, former England manager Glenn Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson, Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ritchie Humphreys, Football League chairman Greg Clarke, and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi. The group will consider how to increase the number of England-qualified players appearing for the country's top clubs. In September, Dyke set England targets of reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the World Cup in 2022. More to follow. </body>

      <title>Titanic violin sold for £900,000</title>
      <description>The violin that was played to calm the Titanic's passengers is sold for £900,000 at auction in Wiltshire - the highest price ever paid for memorabilia from the famous liner.</description>

      <body>The violin that was apparently played to calm passengers on the Titanic as the giant liner sank has sold for £900,000 at auction in Wiltshire. It was played by band leader Wallace Hartley, who died along with 1,517 others as the ship went down. It had a guide price of £300,000. Other items up for sale included his sheet music and the bag he kept it in. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the "rarest and most iconic" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank, most famously the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge and Son, to authenticate the instrument using several experts. These included forensic science experts who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship - used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking - which was bought by a private collector at auction for £220,000 in 2011. </body>

      <title>Boy's sex attacks 'may escalate'</title>
      <description>Police in Manchester say they are concerned a string of sex attacks carried out by a boy aged as young as 12 could escalate.</description>

      <body>Police searching for a boy believed to have carried out sex assaults in Manchester say they are concerned the attacks could escalate. Detectives are appealing for anyone who recognises an e-fit of the boy, aged about 12, to contact them. They are linking three assaults that have taken place in the past month near the University of Manchester. Officers said they believed the boy had been recorded by CCTV cameras. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin said: "It is obviously very unusual and very worrying, that someone so young is committing such appalling attacks on women. "The women are traumatised as a result of what happened and are being offered support by specially trained officers. "Whatever the young boy's motivation, this is not a practical joke or a prank. His actions are disturbing "Given his young age, I would appeal to anyone who may know him - schoolteachers, community leaders or possibly even family members - to either alert the police or bring this young man to a police station as soon as possible. "We cannot allow these sexual assaults to escalate and we need to find him." The first two attacks took place within 15 minutes of each other on 21 September. A 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST before she screamed and the offender ran off. The next incident followed in Oxford Road when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands library. She carried on walking on Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant, who was described as a young boy, aged about 12, who wore green jeans and glasses. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was approached by two young boys and sexually assaulted by one of them. He was described as being of Asian heritage, aged 12 to 13, of slim build and wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack. The woman pushed the boy away but he approached her again and sexually assaulted her for a second time before running off towards Pencroft Way with a second child. </body>

      <title>Roma girl 'can return to France'</title>
      <description>A Roma girl whose deportation sparked protests can return from Kosovo to finish her studies, but her family cannot, French President Hollande says.</description>

      <body>French President Francois Hollande has said a Roma girl who was removed from her school bus and deported can return to finish her studies, but that her family cannot. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was expelled along with her parents and five siblings earlier this month after they lost their battle for asylum in France. The case has sparked protests by student groups across the country. A government investigation ruled that the deportation had been legal. But the report, released on Saturday, said any future such action against school children should be taken outside school hours. The Dibrani family left Kosovo for France five years ago and were living in Levier, in the Doubs region of eastern France. They cited discrimination in Kosovo as grounds for asylum. An order for their expulsion was issued after they lost their battle for asylum. After two postponements, it was rescheduled for October and the father, who was detained in a different town, was expelled on 8 October. Leonarda had stayed at a friend's overnight so was not at the family home when border police arrived to deport them. She was instead taken away by police in front of other students while on a field trip. The whole family were flown back to Kosovo that day. Mr Hollande told French TV: "If she makes a request, because of the circumstances, and because she wants to pursue her schooling in France, a welcome will be extended to her." But he stressed that the invitation was to Leonarda alone. The girl has said she will not return to France without her family. "I will not abandon my family. I'm not the only one who has to go to school, there are also my brothers and sisters," the AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Leonarda's father, Resat Dibrani, told reporters in Mitrovica, where the family are now living, that they would not stay in Kosovo. "I have no freedom here for myself, my children and my family. The police can say whatever they want, but for me, justice does not work in France." But he said the family would not be split up by his daughter going alone. "Either we all go together or nobody goes." Mr Dibrani had admitted this week that he had lied about the children's origins in the hope of boosting their asylum application - only he is from Kosovo but his wife and six children were all born in Italy. The mayor of the Italian town of Fano, where the family lived for several years, said they left after the authorities there threatened to take the children into care. "The children hardly ever went to school even though he had signed them up. He sent them out begging. They lived in the streets," Stefano Aguzzi told AFP. "We told him that he could not continue living here without paying for anything. We gave him a set of rules for him to be able to stay." Mr Aguzzi said that if the family returned, Fano officials would "not welcome them back with open arms" but that would "consider them like we do all the other immigrants". Hundreds of French students have staged protests against the deportation, and the manner in which Leonarda was removed, in Paris and other cities. Much of the anger has been directed at Interior Minister Manuel Valls, previously a popular figure. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says Mr Valls has also faced bitter recriminations from within his own party, accused of betraying the principles of the socialist government. But the government was also warned by the right-wing opposition that if it caved into the protests and allowed the family back, it would set a dangerous precedent, says our correspondent. Mr Hollande's invitation to Leonarda is perhaps the president's best way out of damaging few days, he adds. </body>

      <title>Greek police appeal over blonde girl</title>
      <description>Greek police investigate the identity of a young blonde girl found living with an unrelated couple on a Roma settlement.</description>

      <body>Greek police are trying to discover the identity of a young blonde girl who was found living on a Roma settlement with a family she did not resemble. DNA tests revealed the child, called Maria and aged about four, was not related to the couple she lived with. The little girl is now being looked after by a charity. Her photo has been released to help find her family. Officials believe she may have been a victim of abduction or child trafficking. Police are appealing internationally as the girl looks like she might be from northern or eastern Europe. The charity, Smile of the Child, told the BBC that the girl was frightened and neglected when she arrived in their care but that in overall good health and was now more relaxed. It said it had received many calls since the appeal was launched. A spokesman for the British couple Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case gave them "great hope" that she would one day be found alive. Police raided the Roma camp, near Farsala in central Greece, to search for drugs and weapons. They noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents, and found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple had registered different numbers of children with different regional family registries. The woman claimed to have given birth to six children within a 10-month period. When questioned about how they came to have Maria, the couple gave "constantly changing claims," Thessalia Province Police Director Vassilis Halatsis said. "The girl might have been abducted from a hospital, or given up by an unmarried mother," the officer said. "So far we do not have a declared disappearance of a child of this age in Greece. Through Interpol, we will request assistance from the other European countries." The 39-year-old man and his 40-year-old wife have been arrested on suspicion of abducting a minor. The president of Smile of the Child, Kostas Yaaopoulos, said the girl was being used to beg on the streets. </body>

      <title>Syrian soldiers 'killed in blast'</title>
      <description>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say. The blast triggered clashes at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Earlier, the US urged the Syrian government to allow aid to reach starving civilians in Damascus. Washington said the army's months-long siege left many people in rebel-held areas in desperate need of food, water and medicine. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the suicide car bombing by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front triggered heavy fighting at a key checkpoint between Jaramana and the rebel-held town of Mleha. It said rebels fired rockets into Jaramana during the fighting and Syrian fighter jets retaliated by striking nearby opposition-held areas. The report could not be confirmed. The BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says the use of suicide bombers to open an offensive is a tactic that has been used increasingly by the rebels in recent months. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In August a car bomb in the suburb killed 18 people. Syria's embattled President Assad has drawn support from Syria's ethnic and religious minorities, including Christians and members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. The rebel movement is dominated by Sunni Muslims, who are a majority in Syria. In another development, British surgeon David Nott, who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks, has told the BBC he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. "There was definitely a game going on between the snipers," he said. "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." He added: "They were definitely targeted in the uterus. The majority of the babies didn't make it." Mr Nott said he wanted the UK government to help open up a humanitarian corridor in Syria to allow aid and aid workers to enter the country safely. In a statement on Friday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called on the Syrian government "to immediately approve relief convoys". She warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". At least three of Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk, Eastern Ghouta and Moudamiyah - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. It began with popular protests against President Assad before degenerating into civil war. </body>

      <description>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in New South Wales.</description>

      <body>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in the state of New South Wales. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. It was the same day that a massive bush fire - which is still burning - began. About 200 homes have been destroyed in dozens of fires which have been burning for several days. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says this year's fires have come unusually early after unseasonably hot weather, and many are fearing a long and dangerous summer. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. The Australian Defence Force issued a statement about the fire burning between Lithgow and Bilpin, some 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Sydney, which is reported to have burned through 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) and destroyed properties. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the fire, which began on defence land. "The fire started on 16 October, the same day that defence personnel were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the statement said. "Defence is investigating if the two events are linked. "Our thoughts are with those who have lost property or whose property is threatened by these devastating fires." Firefighters have been trying to make the most of a relatively cool day to tackle about 20 fires that are burning out of control, but higher temperatures and strong winds are expected to create difficult conditions in the coming days. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said Saturday's conditions were a "pause", but that the fire perimeter stretched for more than 500km. "We're by no means out of the woods," he told broadcaster ABC. "It's just calmed down a little bit and obviously we're bracing ourselves for these worsening conditions." Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said some of the fires were so large they would take some time to completely extinguish. "Firefighters will be working on these fires for weeks," he said. "It's all about reducing the risk of these fires to breach containment lines and run under hotter, drier, windier condition over coming days." Smoke and ash from the wildfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced' Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle.

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <title>Share issue for villagers to buy pub</title>
      <description>A community pub company issues shares in an effort to raise funds to buy and reopen a village pub in Suffolk.</description>

      <body>A community venture company has issued shares so that Suffolk villagers can raise funds to buy their local pub. The Case Is Altered, in Bentley, near Ipswich, closed in March and its owner Punch Taverns has put it on the market for £240,000. A committee of seven people has formed Bentley Community Pub Ltd to raise the money to buy and refurbish it with the aim of reopening it next spring. People can buy a minimum of five shares for £50 each. David Westley, chairman of the new company, said: "We believe we are able to turn things around here. "Evidence shows that when people do buy their pubs the community has a much greater sense of ownership and people tend to go more." Mr Westley said the new company was a not-for-profit industrial and provident society and people could buy a maximum of £20,000 worth of shares. Punch said that, although the pub was on the market, it was still looking for a new licensee to run it. A spokesman said: "It is always our preference that our pubs continue to trade as pubs. "However, we do review our estate regularly and may explore other options around the future of some sites which could better fulfil their potential under different ownership." </body>

      <description>Hoffenheim launch a protest after Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling heads the ball through a hole in the net.</description>

      <body>Hoffenheim are set to protest against a freak goal awarded to Bayer Leverkusen when Stefan Kiessling headed the ball through a hole in the side of the net. Referee Felix Brych failed to spot that Kiessling's header flew wide of the post in the 70th minute of Leverkusen's 2-1 Bundesliga win on Friday. Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen said: "It's a scandal. "That was no goal, there are no two ways about it. We are definitely going to protest." Brych, a Fifa referee, said that no player had indicated it was not a goal. "I had a slight doubt but the reaction from the players was clear - nobody was against [the decision]," Brych said. "I checked with Kiessling. But no-one, not even him, said that it wasn't a goal. The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal." Meanwhile, goalscorer Kiessling has apologised saying he could "fully understand the reactions" to the goal on his Facebook page.   "After seeing the replays on television, I can clearly see that it was not a legitimate goal," he said. "During the game, after heading the ball and turning my head, I did not exactly see whether the ball had gone into the goal or not. Somehow, the ball was lying in the goal and I said exactly that to the referee. "I'm sorry for all sports fans. Naturally, it's not nice to win like that. Fairness is important in sport, for us in the club and for me personally." In April 1994, Bayern Munich beat Nuremburg 2-1 after defender Thomas Helmer was awarded a goal despite the ball not going in. Nuremburg lodged a complaint, and Germany's Football Association ordered a replay, which Bayern won 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game." Several Hoffenheim substitutes raced behind the goal to examine the netting and appeared to try to point out Brych's error. But the referee was by then powerless to overrule his original decision. Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director, said: "That's not how we wanted to win the game. The fair result would have been a 2-2." Leverkusen were leading through Sidney Sam's 26th-minute opener when the controversy happened. Germany international Kiessling headed a corner wide of the near post, and could be seen turning away in frustration before Brych awarded the goal. The referee then awarded Hoffenheim a generous penalty when Roberto Firmino was fouled a foot outside the penalty area. But Firmino's spot-kick was saved. Sven Schipplock pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim two minutes from the end, but they could not save a point and fell to their first home defeat of the season. Brych, who refereed England's 3-2 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley in August, sent off Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic during a 2-0 Champions League defeat away to Romanian side Otelul Galati in October 2011. The win took Sami Hyypia's side top, although Bayern Munich can overtake them by beating Mainz on Saturday. </body>

      <body>Liverpool twice came back from a goal down as they had to settle for a point against 10-man Newcastle. Yohan Cabaye's 30-yard strike put the hosts ahead, but Steven Gerrard levelled with a penalty at the end of the first half after Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa was sent off for a foul on Luis Suarez. Paul Dummett's far-post shot restored the Magpies's lead only for Daniel Sturridge to nod the Reds level again. A Suarez shot skimmed the crossbar as Newcastle held on for a draw. A point was enough to move Liverpool top of the Premier League before Saturday's later matches, but Brendan Rodgers's side may be disappointed not to have made more of having an extra man for so much of the game. The Magpies were thrashed 6-0 in the same fixture last season, but showed defensive determination and organisation this time around to nullify Liverpool early on. And the home side built on their promising start when the Reds defence stood off Cabaye, allowing the France international to send a dipping shot past goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. The visitors's best chances were coming from set-pieces and Newcastle left-back Davide Santon, guarding the far post, had to clear a Suarez header before Martin Skrtel and Aly Cissokho nodded over when well-placed. But, after Magpies midfielder Moussa Sissoko stung Mignolet's hands with a powerful 22-yard strike, Yanga-Mbiwa's tug on Suarez gave Liverpool the chance to equalise. The centre-back was the last man when he fouled the Uruguayan and was shown a red card before Gerrard confidently dispatched the spot-kick for his 100th league goal. The Reds looked to take advantage of their numerical advantage and right-back Glen Johnson forced Newcastle keeper Tim Krul into a scrambling save. However, defender Dummett - who had come on after Yanga-Mbiwa's dismissal - shocked the visitors by steering in Cabaye's free-kick to restore the Magpies's lead. This was the signal for Liverpool to pile the pressure on the home side and a Suarez shot was parried by Krul before being cleared. The Reds finally breached Newcastle's stubborn defence when Suarez got to the by-line and crossed for Sturridge to head in from close range. The visitors continued to dominate and Suarez clipped the bar with a shot before seeing his injury-time free-kick saved - but they failed to force a winner as Newcastle, who next face rivals Sunderland, greeted the final whistle with relief. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers: "It was a very good game and one we are obviously disappointed not have got three points from. "It has been difficult; we had 13 players away playing two games in the international break. To show the character we did, as well produce some of the play we did, was outstanding. "We are disappointed not to get all three, but to come back twice I think the point was the least we deserved. We are on the right path and this point could be important at the end of the season." Newcastle boss Alan Pardew: "I thought it was great advertisement for the Premier League. In the opening period of the game, when we had 11 players, we were matching them. "Then we had the guy sent off and I have no qualms about that, he had to go. So we had to show our other side - the resilience. We showed it before against Cardiff and we showed it against Liverpool. "It was a great game on the pitch there as real quality." </body>

      <description>Replacement Gareth Davies' late try gives Cardiff Blues a dramatic win against Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.</description>

      <body>A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park. Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6. Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts. But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted. Having conceded five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players. The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Sandy Park and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club. But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team. The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness. Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy. The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round. In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement. McIntosh - known affectionately as The Chief - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup. But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back. Toulon comfortably saw off Pro12 leaders Glasgow as their title defence opened and their early, attack-minded approach seemed to indicate they were confident of a similar effort in the Welsh capital. But the Blues rose to the criticism that followed their defeat at Exeter to regain respect in Europe in conditions that began in drizzle, continued in a deluge and ended in autumn sunshine. The hosts' pack may not have matched their much-vaunted opponents at the scrum and Toulon's physical superiority was often evident at the breakdowns. But the Blues' line-out was solid and while fly-half Patchell occasionally lost concentration, his tactical kicking was impressive. A fourth-minute long-range Patchell penalty began the duel in which Wilkinson's penalty brace took his side ahead. Halfpenny levelled after lock Bakkies Botha's forearm challenge on Josh Navidi at a ruck and the teams were tied 6-6 at the break. Wilkinson added two more penalties early in the second period, but missed two more chances before Halfpenny brought the hosts level. Former England and Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked his side ahead with a fifth shot from a narrow angle with eight minutes remaining. But after Cory Allen's break took the Blues deep into Toulon's 22, Sam Warburton maintained the momentum with his own surge. Davies, who had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson kicked his final penalty, went on an arcing run and after not being held in a tackle by Toulon's desperate defence, bounced off the synthetic surface to score. Halfpenny added the conversion and Toulon's frantic efforts to hit back were thwarted. Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins (capt), Marc Breeze, Scott Andrews, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Robin Copeland. Replacements: Richard Smith for Cuthbert (41), Gareth Davies for Patchell (72), Benoit Bourrust for Andrews (59), Lou Reed for Paulo (75). Not Used: Kristian Dacey, Sam Hobbs, Rory Watts-Jones, Lewis Jones.

      <body>England women lost seven wickets for 14 runs as they slipped to an 11-run defeat against West Indies in their second game of the tri-series. Chasing 141 for victory in Barbados, the tourists collapsed from 82-1 to 96-8 before finishing on 129-8. Shaquana Quintyne, the 17-year-old leg-spinner, claimed 5-16, including the wicket of captain Charlotte Edwards, who top-scored for England with 39. England face New Zealand, whom they beat in their opening game, on Tuesday. Spinner Danielle Hazell took 3-19 from four overs and seamer Jenny Gunn 2-24 as West Indies, who now top the table, posted 140-6 after losing the toss. Stafanie Taylor made 40 at the top of the order, while Deandra Dottin hit three sixes in her 19-ball 32 and Stacy-Ann King smashed 24 off 10 deliveries to add late impetus to the Windies innings. In reply, Edwards and Lauren Winfield, whose 36 spanned 25 balls, shared an opening partnership of 69 inside 10 overs, but Quintyne removed both to initiate England's collapse. They never recovered from losing Natalie Sciver, Sarah Taylor, Tamsin Beaumont and Gunn in the space of 10 balls, while Hazell and Holly Colvin's unbroken ninth-wicket stand of 36 proved futile. </body>

      <title>Lorenzo takes pole with lap record</title>
      <description>Jorge Lorenzo hits a seagull but sets a lap record to beat Marc Marquez to and claim pole position in Australia.</description>

      <body>Jorge Lorenzo broke the Phillip Island lap record to claim pole for the Australian MotoGP as he fights to keep alive his World Championship defence. The Yamaha racer, 26, dominated the session with a best lap of one minute 27.899 seconds - 0.221 seconds faster than fellow Spaniard Marc Marquez. Marquez is 43 points ahead in the standings and will secure the title in his rookie season if he collects eight more points than Lorenzo.  Briton Cal Crutchlow will start sixth. Tyre problems - which have seen the Moto2 race shortened to 13 laps - mean that the MotoGP race will have a mandatory pit stop, for the first time in MotoGP history. Bridgestone tyres say that they are unable to guarantee the safety of their rear slick tyres beyond 14 laps at a Phillip Island circuit which has been resurfaced since last year's race. Each MotoGP rider will be required to enter the pits and change to his second machine  with fresh tyres at the midway point of the 26-lap race, which has been reduced by a lap. Lorenzo beat Casey Stoner's previous record of 1:28.665, set in 2008, but had to pit to remove a seagull that had lodged in his bike after a collision at the top of Lukey Heights before securing his 28th career MotoGP pole. "We've done our best to be competitive," he said. "This lap [we did] is a lap you can only do with a PlayStation. Today we made it - we improved seven tenths [of a second] from our first ride here. "It's impressive how much faster we can go with new tyres. We're very proud of pole, but our most important thing is tomorrow." Results: 1. Jorge Lorenzo (Spa) Yamaha, 1:27.899 2. Marc Marquez (Spa) Repsol Honda +0.221 seconds 3. Valentino Rossi (Ita) Yamaha +0.748 4. Alvaro Bautista (Spa) Gresini Honda +0.814 5. Dani Pedrosa (Spa) Repsol Honda +0.849 6.

      <description>Manchester United midfielder Adnan Januzaj commits his future to the club by signing a new five-year deal.</description>

      <body>Manchester United midfielder Adnan Januzaj has committed his future to the club by agreeing a new five-year deal. Januzaj, 18, scored both goals in his first competitive start for the Premier League champions in their 2-1 win at Sunderland on 5 October. "It's a great thrill to be able to sign for Manchester United," the Belgium-born player told the club's website.   United manager David Moyes described Januazj, who arrived from Anderlecht in 2011, as "truly exceptional". Januzaj's contract had been due to expire in the summer,  meaning he could have left Old Trafford for a minimal compensation fee as he is under 24. "It's like a dream," added Januzaj, who excelled in United's youth and reserve teams after joining as a 16-year-old. "Since arriving here I have always felt like this was the right club for me." Although named as a substitute in Sir Alex Ferguson's final game in charge of United in May, he has played a more prominent role under Moyes and has impressed since appearing as a substitute in the Community Shield win against Wigan in August. "He is an outstanding talent," said Moyes. "His balance, poise and ability to beat players is truly exceptional for a boy of his age." Januzaj's new deal means United have potentially avoided a repeat of the situation that saw highly-rated midfielder Paul Pogba move to Juventus once his contract expired in 2012. The 20-year-old has gone on to become a regular for both the Serie A champions and France. Uncapped Januzaj is still to commit to an international team and is eligible for the country of his birth, Belgium, as well as Albania, Serbia or Turkey through his parents and grandparents. Belgium coach Marc Wilmots said he had been told the player had made no decision about who to represent after he tried to call him up for the recent 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Croatia and Wales. England manager Roy Hodgson also told Match of the Day that he had been monitoring him. Under governing body Fifa's rules, Januzaj would have to wait until 2018 to represent England, assuming he remains in the country until he turns 23. But the chances of that happening appear slim, as England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales voluntarily agreed to opt out of the residency rule in 1993. </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster."

      <description>British ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, an investigation commissioned by the General Medical Council finds.</description>

      <body>UK ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, the General Medical Council has found. The review into 5,000 candidates was ordered after ethnic minority students complained the exam was unfair. Prof Aneez Esmail, an expert on racism in the NHS who led the investigation, said "unconscious bias" could explain the findings. But the Royal College of GPs, which sets the exams, denies they are unfair. RCGP chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the college took equality and diversity issues "extremely seriously". She added that the college: "strongly refutes any allegations that the exam is discriminatory in any way". The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) - introduced in 2010 - is a practical test in which trainee GPs are assessed by an examiner while they treat actors in a mock-surgery setting. They have up to four attempts to take the test which they must pass before they can practise as a GP. During the six-month review for the GMC, Prof Esmail analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said he could not exclude racial discrimination as the cause of the findings. He told BBC One's Breakfast: "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. "So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way." "So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore," he added. "It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." He said all British doctors, whether white or from ethnic minorities, had "gone through medical school and passed all that and so we're not talking about people who aren't as good as - they're exactly the same". He said the test was "a relatively new technique that's being used and it's bound to improve as time goes on". He has made a number of recommendations to try to combat bias in the exam including having more examiners and actors who are from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the RGCP's Dr Clare Gerada said the review found "no evidence, either through the examiners or through the actors, or through the process of the examination, of discrimination". She added that, "in fact, what it showed was that it was probably preparedness for the exam that was a factor". "We already take comprehensive steps to ensure that the exam is fair and equitable to all candidates," she told BBC News. "This exam is designed for doctors to practise independently; it is not an exam that has to be passed by everyone. I think that is a very important issue. "Of course we cannot be complacent and we continue to make sure the exam does not have bias built in." The review also found that trainee GPs from abroad were 14 times more likely to fail the CSA exam than white British doctors. "We also know that eventually they pass," Dr Gerada said. "We also know that this is a culturally specific exam - it stands to reason if you are born and brought up in this country, within the NHS, that you have an advantage," she added. "If I go to India and sit an exam designed for doctors to practise in India, I will be at a disadvantage." GP Una Coales, meanwhile, said that, "because they use predominantly white actors, even the white actors may not even be aware that they have hidden bias against foreigners". "So if they hear an Indian dialect, for instance, they might pretend that they don't understand them and they might subconsciously withhold vital clues," she said. She said the actors could "give away the agenda or the concern right away if he happens to like you or can withhold it for eight minutes of a 10-minute exam". Organisations representing ethnic minority doctors have threatened legal action against the RCGP. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), said: "Hundreds of doctors' careers have been damaged because they have repeatedly failed the CSA exam. "They are facing institutional bias and are unfairly failing the exam despite extensive training and knowledge." BAPIO has been given permission to launch a judicial review against the RCGP and the GMC over the exam. The General Medical Council said it took the findings of the independent review seriously. "We agree with Prof Esmail that there is no room for complacency - we want to work with him and all those involved in this area," chief executive Niall Dickson said. "We are duty-bound to act where there is evidence of a problem and his report and recommendations make a powerful case for action." </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>
      <date>1382115902</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551945</url>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <body>A taxi driver was shot after his passengers got into an argument with another group of men on a petrol forecourt in Merseyside, police said. A silver Skoda Octavia was shot at after four men inside argued with six men at the garage on Whitefield Drive, Kirkby, at 01:15 BST. The driver, 61, was not thought to be the intended target, police said. He is being treated in hospital for serious injuries to his arm and chest and his condition is said to be stable. There were no reports of other injuries. All the men had left the scene when emergency services arrived and a search for them is ongoing, police said. They are all described as being white, with five wearing dark-coloured clothing and the sixth wearing a cream coloured Adidas-type top. Supt Kevin Wellens said: "This thoughtless and reckless type of behaviour cannot be tolerated, and we are fortunate that no one else was injured particularly as this took place on a garage forecourt. "I would appeal to members of the community who know the people involved to come forward so we can take positive action and take the offenders off the streets before anyone else gets hurt." </body>

      <body>A plane made an emergency landing in a field after running out of fuel. The light aircraft was brought down near Halfpenny Green, on the border of Staffordshire and Shropshire, hitting the ground nose first before flipping over. Two people inside escaped uninjured from the crash, at about 12:10 BST. Firefighter Mark Weaver said the pilot took the decision to bring the plane down to avoid hitting houses in the nearby village of Bobbington. He said it eventually landed about 400ft (120m) from the nearest house. Staff at nearby Halfpenny Green Airport were able to free the two occupants of the plane before fire crews arrived. A Staffordshire Fire Service spokesman said they responded to a light aircraft that had crashed on the approach to the runway. He said: "When we arrived we found it to be in the field. There had been a heavy landing but the pilot was up and walking about when we left the scene. "He was left with the police and breathalysed." </body>

      <body>A Pakistani teenager who was shot in the head by the Taliban has been reunited in Edinburgh with two friends who were injured in the attack. Malala Yousafzai, 16, was targeted last October as a result of her campaigning for better rights for girls. She was in Edinburgh to address the first public meeting of the Global Citizenship Commission. She said her fight for universal education had been empowered as her two friends joined her in her campaign. Malala was guest of honour at the meeting of the commission, which is a joint initiative between former prime minister Gordon Brown, New York University and Carnegie UK Trust. She was also awarded with an honorary masters degree from the university and the Carnegie Award for Wellbeing for her work promoting education and women's rights. She was joined in McEwan Hall by school friends Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan. The three, who all now live and study in the UK, met for the first time since the Taliban attack on their school bus in Pakistan last October. She received a standing ovation from the 1,000-strong audience as she lifted her honorary degree into the air. The teenager said: "I'm here for the first time and it's really nice to see Scotland, I'm enjoying to see the hills, small hills, because we have mountains in Pakistan. "After I was shot the terrorists thought that I would not continue the struggle for education, but not only did I not stop my campaign but now Kainat and Shazia are with me and they are also supporting me. "They are not afraid, we are not afraid and now people are supporting us and that is the greatest courage, and that is the weapon that we have got, the unity and togetherness." She added: "For achieving any goal, people must be united, they must work together and that is why I feel empowered." After the attack Malala was treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has now settled in the city with her family. </body>

      <title>Trauma centre 'alternative to Maze'</title>
      <description>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt says an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre.</description>

      <body>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has said an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre. Mr Nesbitt made the proposal during his speech at his party's annual conference. EU funding of £18m was removed after the DUP withdrew its support for the proposed peace centre on the site of the former prison. Mr Nesbitt said what was missing from the debate was an alternative plan. "I offer that alternative, an alternative that addresses the hidden legacy of the Troubles - poor mental health and well-being. I am sorry to report, we are world-leaders in this field," he said. "Let us create an international mental health centre: a facility that will be a global centre of excellence to help those who suffer trauma, whatever the cause. I am talking about the best in the world." He added: "The world has been generous to us, with their support and their money. "Let us repay them with a centre that will offer help and hope to everyone. Let Northern Ireland become known as the 'go to' place for soldiers traumatised in war, to children traumatised by a gun attack on their school campus, to the survivors of train and plane crashes." He suggested Ormiston House in east Belfast as a possible venue for the new trauma centre, saying it would cost a fraction of the £18m funding for the Maze peace centre. Ormiston House, a 19th Century mansion set on a 13 acre site close to Stormont, is owned by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It bought the Grade B listed building for £9m in 2001, but ten years later, it put the property on the market with an asking price of just £2.5m. It was not sold and the price had since dropped to £1.6m. As UUP leader Mr Nesbitt campaigned against the proposed peace centre at the Maze. "We forced Peter Robinson into a massive u-turn on the Maze, and we did it without a riot, without street protests, without so much as a white line protest. Brains, not brawn," he told the conference. He said another fight his party was committed to was against the "republican campaign for equivalence". Mr Nesbitt said republican paramilitaries had chosen to get involved in violence, they had not been forced into it. "If I forever associate a united Ireland with no warning bombs like Bloody Friday and La Mon, is that my fault? Republicans chose it should be that way," he said. "I believe history will record that among the many things the IRA blew away was the chance for a united Ireland. "By contrast, in a few months time, Scottish nationalists will see a referendum on Scottish independence. Not a gun discharged. Not a bomb detonated. Not a single act of terror required." Mr Nesbitt said the Ulster Unionists wanted the education portfolio at Stormont and would strive to bring in a single education system in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist leader also called for a new covenant with the people of Northern Ireland. "A covenant that recognises that we can do better for all our people by shaping a fairer education system, a stronger economy, better housing and a health service not only free at the point of delivery but with delivery points that are accessible and appropriate to the needs of our people," he said. The speech was Mr Nesbitt's second as party leader - a period which has seen three sitting MLAs quit the party because of differences. Basil McCrea and John McCallister left to form the new party NI21, and David McNarry switched to UKIP. Earlier a prominent speaker was Jim Nicholson, the party's candidate in next year's European elections that will be the first to be fought under Mr Nesbitt's leadership. Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy told the conference it was a long time since the UUP was so united and the DUP so divided. Other speakers will include the new shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Ivan Lewis. </body>

      <body>A service has taken place to mark the first anniversary of a mother's death in a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Karina Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. Matthew Tvrdon, 32, who has paranoid schizophrenia, drove on an eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killing Ms Menzies and injuring 17 others. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. A memorial party was held on Friday evening by Ms Menzies' sister Samantha who is bringing up her three nieces Sophie, 12, Ellie, nine, and Tiana, four. And a church service was held on Saturday at Ely's Church of the Resurrection before the family held a private memorial where lanterns and fireworks will be released. The church became a focus for the community in the aftermath of the tragedy. "The year has been absolutely crazy," said 27-year-old Samantha. "My partner Lee and I are just run off our feet but we wouldn't have it any other way. "The girls are doing well and doing well in school. They obviously have their moments though. "The memorial party was a way for me to thank people for what they've done for the family and to thank the community." Terror was brought to west Cardiff for 30 minutes in October last year when Tvrdon was said in court to have used his van as a "weapon". Adults and children were injured in collisions in Ely and nearby Leckwith as he knocked people over like "skittles". In the most serious incident he targeted Ms Menzies as she walked on the forecourt of Ely fire station with two of her children, Ellie and Tiana. Sophie was on holiday in Florida at the time. She pushed her children out of the way before the van hit her. Tvrdon was told he would be released from Ashworth maximum security hospital in Merseyside only if a mental health tribunal was satisfied he should be released. The Reverend Jan Gould, priest-in-charge at the Church of the Resurrection, said: "The tragedy devastated our community last year and I think it's important that we mark this first anniversary. "Some of the victims were in hospital last year and so were unable to attend the service we had on the weekend it all happened. "They have said they would like an opportunity to attend something in church as a way of helping them to 'move on'. "I hope this service will give the community the opportunity to come together again and show their support for those whose lives were completely turned upside down a year ago in that dreadful incident." </body>

      <body>At least 16 people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack. The Somali government, backed by troops from several African countries, is fighting al-Shabab for control of the country. Al-Shabab said its target was Ethiopian and Djiboutian soldiers in Beledweyne. The bombing occurred at a tea shop popular with the troops in Beledweyne, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, close to the border with Ethiopia. "Our main target was Ethiopian and Djibouti troops who invaded our country," Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, said. But witnesses, including a Somali MP in Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jessow, have told the BBC that most of those killed were civilians. "There is a lack of medicine in the hospital and they can't cope with the flood of wounded patients, so we asked the central government to send us planes to evacuate patients," Mr Jessow said by phone. Al-Shabab militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns, including Mogadishu and the key southern port of Kismayo, by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers. But the militants still control large parts of southern Somalia.

      <body>President Alpha Conde's ruling party in Guinea took just under half of the seats in last month's parliamentary poll, electoral officials have said. They said the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) secured 53 seats in the 114-member parliament. The main opposition party had 37 seats, while the rest went to smaller parties. The opposition said it would not recognise the result of the poll, which international observers said was marred by "irregularities". Opposition spokesman Sydia Toure said the announced result of the 28 September election did not reflect "the people's vote". Earlier, the observers said that "breaches and irregularities were observed in a certain number of constituencies, preventing a significant number of votes from being taken into account". The monitors included representatives from the UN, EU, West African block Ecowas and US and French diplomats. The election in the west African nation is intended to replace a transitional parliament that has run the nation since military rule ended in 2010. The run-up to the election was hit by violence, as well as ethnic and religious tension. It has been much delayed and was supposed to be held six months after the 2010 presidential elections, which Mr Conde narrowly won. </body>

      <title>Police prevent Maldives election</title>
      <description>The Maldives is plunged into fresh political uncertainty as a re-run presidential election, set for Saturday, is cancelled at the last moment.</description>

      <body>Police in the Maldives have stopped a presidential election from going ahead on Saturday, plunging the country into fresh political uncertainty. Electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The latest move has caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process". A US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the failure to hold Saturday's election "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. In a televised speech, Mr Thowfeek said it was a "dark day for democracy". Correspondents said the Maldives' capital, Male, appeared calm early on Saturday, with people still waking up to the news. Mr Nasheed is standing in the election but the two candidates who trailed behind him in an earlier vote - held last month but then annulled - have been fighting for it not to take place. Late on Friday, Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they hadn't had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court didn't issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. Last week, the Maldives Supreme Court annulled the result of the first round of the elections held in September because of alleged irregularities. Mr Nasheed, now the main opposition leader in the Indian Ocean archipelago, won 45% in that poll against 5% for current President Mohamed Waheed. Mr Waheed has since withdrawn from the election. Analysts say that if his replacement is not elected by the end of his official term in three weeks, it will spark a constitutional crisis. Early on Saturday, Mr Thowfeek had announced: "We will hold the election in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. "The start of the voting may be delayed in some places, but we will allow more time for people to cast their ballots." However, within hours police were at the electoral commission and Mr Thowfeek was obliged to call the election off. "Police personnel in this building stopped us taking anything from here [election offices], so we have no other option except to stop the election today," he said. "A new date for elections will be informed later," he added. International observers had all praised the conduct of the first-round election, and the Supreme Court's decision to annul it was condemned by Mr Nasheed's supporters. Mr Nasheed came to power in 2008 in the Maldives' first free elections, but resigned amid violent protests and a mutiny by senior police officers in February 2012. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <body>A court in Milan has banned Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, from holding public office for two years, following his conviction for tax fraud. However, the ban must be approved by parliament before taking effect. Earlier this month, a cross-party panel of the Italian Senate recommended his expulsion from the chamber. Berlusconi had threatened to topple the coalition government over the issue but backed down during a confidence vote. If he is expelled from the senate, he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. He will also spend a year under house arrest, or doing community service - his preferred option, according to a request he formally submitted last week. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi, 77, was convicted over deals his firm Mediaset made to purchase TV rights to US films. He was sentenced to four years in prison, automatically reduced to one under a 2006 pardon act. He was also banned from holding public office for five years. The sentence was upheld in August. </body>

      <title>Spain party treasurer 'sent cash'</title>
      <description>The ex-treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party Luis Barcenas tells a court he handed illegal cash to the party's secretary general, a claim she denies.</description>

      <body>The former treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party says he handed thousands of euros in slush fund payments to the party's secretary general. Speaking by video link from jail, Luis Barcenas said he had given two envelopes with 7,500 euros (£6,350; $10,300) to Maria Cospedal in 2008. Ms Cospedal - who is suing Mr Barcenas for defamation - denied the claim. Mr Barcenas is in custody pending trial over corruption claims. The scandal has rocked the party and angered Spaniards. The former treasurer was giving evidence to a court in Toledo on Friday. He claimed he had personally delivered the cash to Ms Cospedal. Mr Barcenas added that the slush fund payments were a PP tradition. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier this year denied the claim. He also said allegations that he had personally received illegal payments were "lies and manipulations". The Barcenas affair sparked widespread anger in Spain, hit by a double-dip recession and high unemployment. In July, clashes erupted between anti-government protesters and police after more than 1,000 people gathered outside the PP headquarters in Madrid, calling on the government to resign. The scandal originated in a 2009 judicial investigation into corrupt payments involving PP members. In January this year, El Pais newspaper published an list it said showed illegal payments to party members that had been signed off by Mr Barcenas. The former party treasurer says he made numerous bonus cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other senior party members out of the slush fund of donations by businesses. In response, they have accused the ex-treasurer of trying to blackmail them. The PP was handed a clear mandate by Spanish voters at the end of 2011 and as a result Mr Rajoy and his party enjoy a clear majority in parliament. The corruption allegations coincide with Spain's worst economic crisis for decades, and have threatened to destabilise government attempts to shore up public finances and bring the recession to an end. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 35 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <title>Lebanese hostages in Syria 'freed'</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims held hostage in Syria since May 2012 have been freed, the Lebanese interior minister says.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims held hostage in Syria have been freed, Lebanon's interior minster has said. The pilgrims have crossed over into southern Turkey, and will arrive back in Lebanon soon, according to Interior Minister Marwan Charbel. The nine were part of a group of 11 who were seized while making their way back to Lebanon in May 2012 after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of the group were subsequently released. The pilgrims' release had been reported by Lebanese officials three days after they were seized, but it then transpired that they had not left Syria. "The story is over," Mr Charbel told the Reuters news agency. "In the next 24 hours, they will be with us [in Lebanon]." The Qatari foreign minister told the al-Jazeera television network on Friday that the pilgrims' release had now come about due to Qatari mediation. The news was greeted with jubilation in southern Beirut, where relatives of some of those kidnapped live, according to local media reports. In August a group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it was behind the kidnapping of two Turkish pilots in Beirut, saying they would be freed in exchange for the pilgrims. Mr Charbel said he now expected the two pilots, Murat Akpinar and co-pilot Murat Agca, to be released soon, according to Reuters. "We insist that those who kidnapped the Turks release them,'" he said, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was also quoted as saying he expected a resolution to their case soon. "Very positive developments are under way in the case of the pilots; this matter has largely been settled," Mr Davutoglu said on Turkish television, according to AFP. Earlier this week the two appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. There are also expectations that a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government might be released as part of an elaborate three-way deal. </body>

      <body>Two convicted murderers freed from prison with forged paperwork dutifully went to a jail to register as felons several days after their release. Florida officials are searching for Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, who were serving life sentences. Prison officials said they will tighten up their early-release policy to ensure there is no repeat of the blunder. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after first convict's release. It is not clear who made the bogus release documents, or if the escapes were related. Jenkins walked free on 27 September and registered three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker was set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The two prisoners apparently signed on to keep up the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. A deputy at the jail verifies that felons do not have any outstanding warrants, according to jail spokesman Allen Moore. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, officials have said. Authorities received release orders bearing the faked signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry, printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in the city of Carrabelle, in the north of the state. Sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters: "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody." Judge Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department, notably, how rare it is for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons will now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

Supplies in the rebel-held areas of Damascus are close to running out, and the International Committee of the Red Cross has asked all sides to allow them to feed the people.

      <body>New powers to crack down on modern slavery are to be introduced in a bid to end the trafficking of hundreds of men, women and children to the UK every year. One measure includes the introduction of a maximum life sentence for the worst cases of exploitation. At present the conviction rate is one of the lowest in Europe, according to the Human Trafficking Foundation. The BBC has spoken to Adriana, whose name has been changed to protect her identity. She was orphaned at 17, and forced into a violent marriage when another man promised her a better life in the UK. She told the BBC's Sophie Long how she accepted but on arrival was raped, imprisoned and kept as a sex slave. </body>

      <body>It is 50 years since John F Kennedy was assassinated. Where were you when you heard the news? Kennedy was sworn in as president in 1961. At 43 he was the country's youngest president and presented himself as a youthful figure for a new generation. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline were riding slowly in a motorcade through Dallas. At 12:30 the president was hit in the head and throat when three shots were fired at his open-topped car. He was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. According to the Warren Commission established to investigate the assassination, a lone gunman - Lee Harvey Oswald - killed the president. There has been consistent speculation ever since that Kennedy's death was the result of a conspiracy. The news shocked the nation and the world. British-American journalist Alistair Cooke said he could not remember a time in the previous 30 years when people everywhere were "so quiet, so tired looking" and "so plainly the victims of a huge and bitter disappointment". In his Letter from America, Cooke recalled the promise of the youthful president, saying there was "the sense that we've been cheated… of the promise of what we had begun to call the age of Kennedy". Can you remember where you were when you heard the news? Have you got any photos from the day or did you ever meet the president? Wherever you are in the world, we want to hear your story.

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on spin doctors and screen legends</description>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was Britain's first Hollywood superstar, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is rule for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Meet the manager of the world's worst football team</description>

      <body>Waking up on an island of crystal blue lakes, turquoise seas and tropical temperatures each morning sounds like paradise. But rather than relaxing in a hammock all day in his adopted home of the Turks and Caicos Islands, 41-year-old Englishman Matthew Green is busy trying to rid the country of the title 'world's worst football team'. It's a distinction they share with Bhutan and San Marino at joint 207th place in the Fifa world football rankings. The task isn't easy, as Green's team last won in 2008 (against St Lucia) and haven't actually played a match for two years because of a shortage of players. His squad includes a variety of occupations, including a policeman, lawyer, teacher and construction worker. Add the fact that his only other managerial experience is with a pub team in Hull and you get an idea of how tough his job is. "Everybody thinks you are sat on the beach drinking pina coladas," Green says. "I wish I was, but there is too much to do. "I did once take a pub side in Hull, called Spiders, to a Sunday League title. But that was a bit different to running an international team. "Every time I go back to Hull, my brother and friends make fun of the fact we are ranked so low. I know they are only joking but there is pride there. You want to see your country rise up the rankings. "We are certainly capable of doing so, if we can get some extra resources." The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British territory made up of 40 Caribbean islands - eight are inhabited - covering an area of 166 square miles. The overall population is about 30,000, one third of whom are under 15. As technical director of their football association, Green is responsible for overseeing all aspects of football development, from working with the men's and women's national teams to the youth set-up, coaching and refereeing. The island's league has six amateur teams, yet most of the players are expats meaning Green has a pool of fewer than 25 players to choose from. There are some talented youngsters, but they tend to be on scholarships in America and the UK, making it difficult to return for matches or training camps. One of the few professionals available is Gavin Glinton, 34, who plays for Vietnamese second division club Mikado Nam Dinhis. He is the country's all-time top goalscorer, with four goals in eight international matches. "The players are great to deal with, for the most part," says Green, one of three full-time football employees. The island's FA was formed in 1996 and became affiliated to Fifa two years later. Back then they had no pitches, no leagues, and had to wait until 2006 for their first win - against the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Cup. So how did a former teacher from Hull become their manager? Green was released by Hull City at the age of 15 for being too small and went on to qualify as a teacher. He arrived in the Bahamas in 1998 trying to find a job at a school. The search was fruitful and he turned Temple Christian High School into one of the major powerhouses of Bahamian football, with the senior high girls team winning the national championship every year from 2001 to 2007. At the same time he also started to work his way up the national coaching ladder. He was also an active player, finishing top scorer for Grasshoppers FC in 2000 and 2001. In 2007, he spotted an advert for technical director of the Turks and Caicos Islands FA and decided to give it a go. He landed the job and discovered an island of beautiful beaches and average summer temperatures of 29C. It's little surprise that celebrities such as Hollywood actor Bruce Willis and England defender Rio Ferdinand have splashed out on properties there in recent years. Green lives on his own in a two-bedroom house surrounded by natural vegetation, overlooking lakes and hills. A balcony provides picture-perfect views. After 15 years in the Caribbean he feels at home, although traces of his heritage are revealed from time to time. "My accent varies depending on who I am talking to," he says. "I have a 'coaching voice' which is a bit of a 'put on', but it makes sure all our players can understand me. "My Hull accent comes out when I get angry or excited - which is quite often!" The islands haven't played since their 10-0 aggregate defeat to the Bahamas in a World Cup qualifier in 2011. Green is determined to hold a couple of friendlies in the coming months, ahead of their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign in the Concacaf group. And he's sure there are reasons for optimism. "Within a few years we have managed to put together a pretty strong youth programme and our grassroots programme is pretty big," he says. "We now have over 20 leagues and competitions across all ages and sexes. A few years ago we had three. "It has not been easy, but it has become the most popular sport in the country at youth level. Track and field, softball and basketball are still very popular but, in terms of numbers, football is well ahead now. "A new 5,000-capacity stadium was built the other year thanks to Fifa funding, while we now have more than 500 youngsters registered to our youth programmes compared to less than 100 when I first started." Maybe he can even get the islands off the dreaded bottom spot in the rankings, which really would be reason for celebration. </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>The secrets revealed by babies' laughter</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Brazil confident of Libra oil field success</title>
      <description>How Brazil hopes to reap large rewards from its oil fields</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24583432</url>

      <body>"Pre-Salt". A term that hardly anyone outside oil industry would have ever heard of and, even if they had, it holds few clues as to what it really is. But those two incongruous, single-syllable words hold the key to Brazil's hopes of becoming a major oil producer, securing billions of dollars in revenue and helping to boost a faltering economy. Not far off the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, and just to the north east of the famous coastal city is the area in question. It is an almost unimaginably large oil deposit; 1,500 sq km (579 sq miles) and 326m (1,070ft) deep. Although it lies well beneath the sea bed, under a thick layer of rock and salt, the find is said to be relatively risk-free. Estimates vary but it could hold as many as 12bn barrels of oil. The find has been called "Libra" and Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. We discussed Libra and its implications for Brazil as a global oil producer, in her Rio de Janeiro headquarters. She dismissed, with a wry smile, suggestions the country didn't have the experience or infrastructure to cope with such a huge undertaking as the development of the Libra field. "Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure," said the woman who trained as an oil engineer but is now one of the most powerful figures in the industry. "Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK." Just to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the once small fishing village of Macae is the closest land point to the offshore fields. It's not quite El Dorado but property prices here are already among the highest in the country and these days the noise of helicopters ferrying workers out to the existing rigs is much louder than the chug of fishing boats around the mangroves. Realising the urgent need for able workers if Brazil is to make the most of its impending oil boom, the local authority here is training hundreds of people to work on the rigs. Many are migrant workers from other parts of Brazil, like 32 year-old Claudia, who is learning to be a skilled welder. "Where I'm from, up in Bahia, sadly there's no work - it's all down here," Claudia tells me. "The training lasts three to four months and I'm now in the final stages. But it's free and I'm actually working in the company where I expect to get a job." According to Claudia at least half of the people in her own north-eastern village have made the long journey south, hoping for a well-paid job, like hers, in the oil sector. When the bidding process for the Libra auction was announced, there was considerable surprise that several major oil producers, including BP, the BG Group, Exxon and Chevron, decided not to enter. All are involved quite heavily in other parts of Brazil's diverse energy sector but many analysts say the high proportion of profits being demanded by the Brazilian government and strict conditions of the lease had persuaded some companies to turn their backs on Libra. Brazil has made it clear it expects to keep somewhere in the region of 70% of the profits from the Libra field. Whoever wins the bidding will certainly be looking at long, not short-term returns as developing the find will require at least $200bn (£123bn). Oh, and there's a one-off, up-front bonus payment of $5bn to the Brazilian government in return for winning the auction as well. Nonetheless, there are hundreds of small and medium foreign firms doing very well on the back of Brazil's oil boom. Companies like the British-owned Swire Group, which has plenty of offshore experience in other deep-water environments, specialises in providing containers and cabling for the industry. Swire now employs about 50 people at its plant in Macae. They will soon be moving to new, bigger premises on the other side of town and hope to increase their workforce four-fold in the next five years. "You have to approach this from a Brazilian perspective," says Marcelo Nacif, Swire's local general manager. "You have to have local people who understand the culture and the bureaucracy and you have to adapt." The bottom line, says Mr Nacif, is that specialist companies like his have to go where the oil is and, for now, that's Brazil. "The North Sea is on the down side, right?" he asks rhetorically. "Every day there's less oil, less gas there so if those companies don't look at South America and Africa in the future their business is going to shrink." There is still a highly protectionist and barrier-driven nature to doing business in Brazil and some here object to the involvement of foreign businesses, in any way whatsoever, in the Libra bidding process. Workers from Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras, have just gone out on strike over the issue and their demand for bigger salaries. But, say many analysts, their arguments are difficult to comprehend. Brazil just doesn't have the capacity or ability to develop Libra on its own, certainly not to its full potential. Furthermore, under the straight-jacket Brazil is forcing the winning bidder to wear, is a stipulation that Petrobras must share 30% of the new venture and be allowed to operate all of the rigs in the new field. Oil has always proved to be a blessing and a curse. On the impoverished fringes of Macae, only 10% of the residents have basic sewage facilities, crime is rampant but some improvements are finally being made to people's lives by the local authority. President Dilma Rousseff has promised to divert all of Brazil's petroleum revenues back into social services and public works but what Brazil does with the windfall from the Libra auction will be watched very closely here. </body>

      <title>Going nuclear: UK's deal with China</title>
      <description>Should UK worry about China nuclear investment?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-24575430</url>

      <body>Perched high on top of one of the giant new reactor buildings under construction at Taishan we had a view over the entire site. It's one of the biggest nuclear plants of its kind in the world: six reactors being built on the edge of the South China Sea. In front of us construction cranes encircled the egg-like shape of another huge, grey concrete reactor shell. They swung lazily back and forth. Teams of workers were welding metal bars in place. Everything looked incredibly orderly. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, looked impressed. Mr Osborne had just announced that he will welcome Chinese participation in building nuclear power stations in Britain. Mr Osborne's host, Zhang Shan Ming, the general manager of the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), obviously keen to stress the safety features of the reactor, was explaining why the concrete casing was so thick. "It's against air traffic crash," Mr Zhang said. "Right," the UK chancellor replied. "Special safety procedures." "An earthquake, or tsunami, or typhoon, you are prepared for that?" Mr Osborne asked. "The design is prepared for this," he was told. Britain's chancellor seemed reassured, as he needs to be, given that a near replica of Taishan is now likely to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset in the UK at a cost of around £14 billion ($22bn) by a similar consortium to that working in China. Taishan uses European-designed reactors built by a partnership between the French firm EDF and China's CGN. It's one of almost 30 new nuclear power plants China is building or planning to build. China has not had any major accidents at its nuclear power stations, and says its safety record is good. But there are concerns that, in the dash to build so many new reactors, and use indigenous Chinese technology in some, safety could be compromised. Just down the coast from Taishan lies Hong Kong, where environmental groups enjoy far more freedom than they would have in China. They say there are reasons the UK should be cautious about partnering with China's nuclear operators. "My first concern would be the lack of transparency," says Prentice Koo, senior campaigner at Greenpeace. "Their track record is really bad. For every incident in a nuclear power plant in China, they only provide a very brief report, and all it says is how they solved the problem," he says. "They never give the reason for the incident." His second concern is whether Chinese companies would actually pay up if they were found liable for any incident that happened to a reactor they had built overseas. "The nuclear industry in China enjoys such a privileged position that they have to pay only very limited sums in compensation if there is any major incident," explains Mr Koo. "Overseas they'll be required to pay a lot more... it'll test the ability of China's nuclear industry to pay up." At Taishan, though, they were keen to point out not only their safety features, but also how transparent they are. Dong Shi Ming, a public relations officer, said it was so open that members of the public could come and visit the site - all they had to do was apply for an organised tour. He claimed thousands had already done so. Is China's nuclear industry safe or not? Is it really transparent? They're important questions. Involvement in the UK will test China's firms. It may even force them to be more transparent. The only other place where China has built reactors so far is in Pakistan. Some in the West will be deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of Chinese state-owned firms being involved in the building and running of UK nuclear plants. After all, China remains an authoritarian state, its nuclear firms answerable, ultimately to the Communist Party. For now they are to be minority players in the UK. But one day they may have control over some of Britain's strategic energy supplies. Others, like George Osborne, see a great opportunity. As one member of the British delegation explained to me, deeper commercial engagement will give China a bigger stake in Britain's success. Britain's goodwill in opening up to Chinese firms could engender better ties and reciprocal opportunities for British firms in China's nuclear industry. The UK is already a major investor in China through oil firms like Shell and BP. Getting China to invest more in the UK makes the relationship more balanced, the argument goes. China now has stakes in Britain's oil and gas industries; nuclear opens a major new area to it. Some of this boils down to long-running arguments: Is it better to engage China or to be cautious? Is it wise to draw it into a deeper relationship with the outside world or be wary of the intentions of its opaque Communist rulers? At Taishan George Osborne has taken a big, some might worry risky, step: he's gone nuclear. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up?</title>
      <description>Is China's economic growth as breakneck as figures suggest?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24577043</url>
      <date>1382070335</date>

      <body>China's economy sped up in the July-to-September quarter to expand at 7.8% year-on-year, according to official gross domestic product (GDP) figures. That's faster than the previous quarter when GDP grew at 7.5% and the January-to March quarter's 7.7% expansion. Unless the fourth quarter tanks, it means that the Chinese government will hit its growth target of 7.5% for the year, as the growth rate for the first nine months came in at 7.7%. If they were to hit the target, it would be the slowest growth rate since 1999 which was the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese government is aiming for a slower and better balanced economy that can grow more sustainably. But, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are more questions than ever over the reliability of Chinese figures. It's not just GDP, but the other data releases today have also come in largely as expected: industrial production rising 10.2% from a year earlier in September, retail sales up 13.3%, fixed asset investment grew by 20.2%. I've written about the trouble with Chinese figures before, particularly when it comes to GDP. But, how good are the three indicators reportedly espoused by China's premier Li Keqiang as being more reliable? They are gaining prominence as they are being used by banks such as Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as an alternative index for Chinese growth. The first indicator is electricity usage. The amount of power used by households and firms is a good gauge of consumption and one that is hard to hide. One problem is that China subsidizes some prices so it's somewhat mis-measured, but it's a decent economic indicator. Credit Suisse estimates it's around 9% annualised growth. The amount of cargo freight is the second measure. Instead of factories saying how much they've produced (recall that they have been chastised for faking figures in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces this year), it's more reliable to take a look ourselves. Railway cargo volume shows how much has been manufactured and is being moved around the country. But it is an under-measurement of economic activity because it only captures around 40% of GDP - the biggest part of the Chinese economy now is services. Cargo freight volumes are growing at around 21%. The final gauge is bank loans. How much households and firms borrow over the medium and long-term reflects the amount of demand in the economy for investment. This is why it's a good indicator of economic activity. But if this is used unproductively to build ghost cities, then it's a different way of over-stating growth. These loans are growing at about 5%. It's not just Western banks that look at this data. I understand from Chinese government researchers that a rule of thumb is if the Li Keqiang indicators show about 10-11% growth, then real GDP growth would be around 7-8%. In which case, today's GDP figure would be consistent with the Li Keqiang index and show that the Chinese economy is speeding up. But, there are others who are convinced that Chinese officials won't miss (bar an external crisis that can be blamed) a growth target, so none of these government-produced figures are very reliable. Plus, none of these indicators, even viewed together, would be able to give a complete picture. One thing is clear is that this debate is sure to run and run. For the Chinese leadership who are keen to show that they're cracking down on fraudulent data and increasing confidence in the economy, it would help if they could indicate why they are well-equipped to produce GDP figures faster than any other major economy in the world. Doing so in just over 2 weeks is a fairly remarkable feat for any country, much less one with 1.3 billion people. That's a lot of data to process in a rather short period of time. </body>

      <body>Flash flooding is said to be causing problems around Cardiff on Saturday afternoon following heavy rain. Areas affected included Pentrebane, Llandaff, Roath, Cathays, parts of north Cardiff and Culverhouse Cross. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said police had closed Mill Road in the Ely area of the city due to localised flooding. A spokesperson said six fire engines had been dealing with separate incidents across the city. Marks and Spencer in Culverhouse Cross was hit by rain coming into the store forcing some areas to be sectioned off to the public. There are said to be several flooding incidents in Ely, including one at a private property. The fire service said the Met Office had reported that the band of rain was leaving the Cardiff area and heading towards Monmouthshire. </body>

      <body>A service has taken place to mark the first anniversary of a mother's death in a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Karina Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. Matthew Tvrdon, 32, who has paranoid schizophrenia, drove on an eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killing Ms Menzies and injuring 17 others. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. A memorial party was held on Friday evening by Ms Menzies' sister Samantha who is bringing up her three nieces Sophie, 12, Ellie, nine, and Tiana, four. And a church service was held on Saturday at Ely's Church of the Resurrection before the family held a private memorial where lanterns and fireworks will be released. The church became a focus for the community in the aftermath of the tragedy. "The year has been absolutely crazy," said 27-year-old Samantha. "My partner Lee and I are just run off our feet but we wouldn't have it any other way. "The girls are doing well and doing well in school. They obviously have their moments though. "The memorial party was a way for me to thank people for what they've done for the family and to thank the community." Terror was brought to west Cardiff for 30 minutes in October last year when Tvrdon was said in court to have used his van as a "weapon". Adults and children were injured in collisions in Ely and nearby Leckwith as he knocked people over like "skittles". In the most serious incident he targeted Ms Menzies as she walked on the forecourt of Ely fire station with two of her children, Ellie and Tiana. Sophie was on holiday in Florida at the time. She pushed her children out of the way before the van hit her. Tvrdon was told he would be released from Ashworth maximum security hospital in Merseyside only if a mental health tribunal was satisfied he should be released. The Reverend Jan Gould, priest-in-charge at the Church of the Resurrection, said: "The tragedy devastated our community last year and I think it's important that we mark this first anniversary. "Some of the victims were in hospital last year and so were unable to attend the service we had on the weekend it all happened. "They have said they would like an opportunity to attend something in church as a way of helping them to 'move on'. "I hope this service will give the community the opportunity to come together again and show their support for those whose lives were completely turned upside down a year ago in that dreadful incident." </body>

      <description>Replacement Gareth Davies' late try gives Cardiff Blues a dramatic win against Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.</description>

      <body>A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park. Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6. Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts. But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted. Having conceded five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players. The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Sandy Park and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club. But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team. The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness. Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy. The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round. In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement. McIntosh - known affectionately as The Chief - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup. But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back. Toulon comfortably saw off Pro12 leaders Glasgow as their title defence opened and their early, attack-minded approach seemed to indicate they were confident of a similar effort in the Welsh capital. But the Blues rose to the criticism that followed their defeat at Exeter to regain respect in Europe in conditions that began in drizzle, continued in a deluge and ended in autumn sunshine. The hosts' pack may not have matched their much-vaunted opponents at the scrum and Toulon's physical superiority was often evident at the breakdowns. But the Blues' line-out was solid and while fly-half Patchell occasionally lost concentration, his tactical kicking was impressive. A fourth-minute long-range Patchell penalty began the duel in which Wilkinson's penalty brace took his side ahead. Halfpenny levelled after lock Bakkies Botha's forearm challenge on Josh Navidi at a ruck and the teams were tied 6-6 at the break. Wilkinson added two more penalties early in the second period, but missed two more chances before Halfpenny brought the hosts level. Former England and Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked his side ahead with a fifth shot from a narrow angle with eight minutes remaining. But after Cory Allen's break took the Blues deep into Toulon's 22, Sam Warburton maintained the momentum with his own surge. Davies, who had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson kicked his final penalty, went on an arcing run and after not being held in a tackle by Toulon's desperate defence, bounced off the synthetic surface to score. Halfpenny added the conversion and Toulon's frantic efforts to hit back were thwarted. Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins (capt), Marc Breeze, Scott Andrews, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Robin Copeland. Replacements: Richard Smith for Cuthbert (41), Gareth Davies for Patchell (72), Benoit Bourrust for Andrews (59), Lou Reed for Paulo (75).

      <title>High-speed rail 'losers' revealed</title>
      <description>The local economies that stand to lose from the new north-to-south high speed rail link - which include Cardiff - are revealed for the first time.</description>

      <body>The potential losses to some regional economies from the HS2 high-speed rail link have been revealed. HS2 would make more than 50 places across the UK worse off - such as Aberdeen, Bristol and Cardiff - research by KPMG suggested. The government said HS2's £17bn cost is part of a £73bn package of transport improvements in the next parliament. It claimed the measures would benefit areas which HS2 will not serve, long before the high-speed line opens. The 92-page KPMG report was released in September. Hailed by the government, it said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year. It listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London (£2.8bn) and West Midlands (£1.5bn) the biggest winners. But, the extent to which regions not on the proposed line would be affected was only revealed following a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called the figures "unsurprising". Economic output would be worst affected, according to the research, in: James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Dundee and Angus could lose as much as 2% of its annual GDP, KPMG found. Kettering, Suffolk West and Cambridgeshire East are all listed as zones that could see a 1% drop in GDP. The accountants used data from HS2 Ltd's assessment of the direct transport impacts of the scheme, which would connect London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds. The Department for Transport said HS2 was vital to "rebalance the economy". A spokesman said: "These figures show it boosts the north overall more than the south. "Of course the line does not serve every city and region and these figures reflect that." The DfT say ultimately the line would reduce journey times to Edinburgh and Glasgow by an hour. KPMG said its report clearly shows the benefits of HS2 for some regions and the negative impacts it might have on others. A spokesman said: "Maps in the report show potential productivity gains would outweigh the potential losses and the benefits to the UK economy would be far greater than the negative impacts. "Newsnight did not contact KPMG prior to its programme. "If they had, we could have helped them understand how the underlying data is represented in the report we have produced." Professor Henry Overman from the London School of Economics - formerly an expert adviser to HS2 Ltd - told the BBC it was obvious that, as some cities, towns and regions reap the benefits of being better connected, other places away from the line will pay a price. "When a firm is thinking of where to locate, it thinks about the relative productivity of different places, and the relative wages etc," he said. "HS2 shifts that around. So if you are on the line that makes you a better place that hasn't had that productivity improvement." But Newsnight's political correspondent David Grossman said there were "questions about the robustness" of the data. The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." PDF download HS2 FOI request[97kb] </body>

      <title>Rebates 'swallow up' tax increases</title>
      <description>Rebates will swallow up as much as a third of money from council tax increases next year, leading local government figures have said.</description>

      <body>Up to a third of money from council tax increases next year will be swallowed up by rebates, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) has said. The Welsh government has not increased council tax benefit funding next year. It means councils will pay the increased cost of benefit for all recipients in their area as bills rise. UK ministers devolved council tax benefit to Wales last year with a 10% funding gap, and it has been the centre of political controversy ever since. WLGA resources director Jon Rae told the assembly's finance committee: "With the new council tax reduction scheme, local authorities essentially have to swallow their own smoke on any council tax increases. "So there's a brake on the ability to raise additional income from council tax of about a quarter to a third of the increase which will have to go on funding the council tax reduction scheme." Torfaen council cabinet member Anthony Hunt said: "It used to be that we could depend on a percentage raise in council tax raising us about £300,000 in Torfaen. "Now it's nearer £200,000 because of the impact of the council tax reduction scheme. "So if you compare that figure to the savings we need to make - it's very small." The Welsh government announced earlier in the week that it would continue to make up a shortfall in council tax benefit funding of around £22m next year. But that does not take into account the cost to the scheme of funding any increases in council tax next year. On Wednesday Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said she expected council tax bills to go up next year but she refused to speculate how much. The WLGA has been using an estimate of a 3.5% rise in its financial projections which would add around £40 to the average band D bill. Early modelling as a result of the draft budget indicated a shortfall of between £400m and £440m for local government over the next two years, the finance committee was told. Members were told councils had begun drawing down reserves last year for the first time since 1999. Mr Rae said about £30m had been taken out, but warned that use of reserves to plug funding gaps was not a realistic option as the current total reserves held by all councils in Wales amounted to about ten days' expenditure. "Sometimes many out there think that underneath county hall there is a great big pot of gold, and there isn't," he said. Witnesses from local government said they had not been given sufficient warning of the scale of next year's cuts. They said that as late as June this year they were still working on the basis of an average increase of 0.5% for councils next year. Mr Rae said they had then been told there were "English-style cuts" on the way but said they needed firmer figures for planning purposes. The draft budget will actually result in a cut of 3.5% to council budgets for 2014/15. </body>

      <title>Illegal waste dump farmer sentenced</title>
      <description>A farmer who allowed over 80,000 tonnes of waste to be dumped illegally in a disused reservoir is handed a 10-month suspended sentence.</description>

      <body>A farmer who allowed over 80,000 tonnes of waste to be dumped illegally in a disused reservoir has been handed a 10-month suspended sentence. Paul Morris, 47, of Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, was paid over £280,000 for running the illegal landfill site from March 2006 to July 2010 on his farm. He denied allowing the waste to be dumped but was found guilty last month. He was sentenced at Newport Crown Court on Friday where a judge said he was "appalled" at Morris's actions. Morris was also ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. The court heard that officers from the Environment Agency visited Carreg Bica Isaf Farm in August 2010 after neighbours complained about a strong smell. The officers found decomposing waste and a dark-coloured run-off, known as leachate, escaping into nearby woodland. Samples taken from the farm land in September 2010 revealed ammonia levels were as high as those found in raw sewage, the court was told. More than 20 companies who tipped waste at the site were investigated by an environmental crime team. Christian Jowett, prosecuting, said Morris claimed much of the 80,000 tonnes was inert material which would not have caused environmental damage, but it should not have been there at all because Morris did not have an appropriate licence. Sentencing Morris, Judge Rhys Rowlands said: "You allowed a great deal of waste to be deposited on your land. In the process of doing so you or an employee would cover it to hide its true nature." He added the offences were "deliberate, persistent and done for profit". "The offences only came to light when woodland became contaminated. Up until then you were able to get away with it by covering it with inert material," added the judge. "Undoubtedly you created a problem and that will remain for some years. Our environment is a precious commodity. I'm appalled at what you were doing." Judge Rowlands said it was a "serious example of sustained environmental crime" and there had to be consequences to deter others from doing the same. Gregg Taylor QC, defending Morris, said his client believed that after applying for planning permission he was able to dump waste in the disused reservoir on his land. "The amount of contaminated waste is but a small part. The vast majority of the waste was not hazardous," said Mr Taylor. He said Morris had performed "considerable work" to keep the pollution within the boundaries of his land and he had the knowledge and machinery to help the authorities monitor ammonia levels in future. Following the court hearing, Gareth O'Shea of Natural Resources Wales, said: "We hope the outcome of this case will send out a positive message to those in the waste industry, that Natural Resources Wales will not tolerate those who seek to profit by breaking the law, harming local communities or damaging the environment. "The motivation behind the crime was financial. The site did not have the necessary permissions and consequently the infrastructure to protect the environment and it undercut legitimate permitted sites." </body>

      <body>Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Elfyn Llwyd has announced he is stepping down as MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd at the 2015 election. Mr Llwyd, who has served in Westminster for 21 years, said it had been the highest honour to serve his constituency, party and nation. He said the time had come to turn his hand to other work and other interests. Mr Llwyd played a lead role in the campaign which brought about two new offences of stalking last year. Plaid Cymru said the MP had also been a tireless advocate of veterans' rights and was one of the leaders of the campaign to impeach Tony Blair in the wake of the Iraq war. The party added that Mr Llwyd had made a huge contribution to devolution and the constitutional future of Wales. Mr Llwyd said: "I have decided not to put my name forward to seek re-nomination for the 2015 general election. "I am hugely grateful to the people of Dwyfor Meirionnydd and Nant Conwy for their support and loyalty over the years. "It has been the highest honour to serve my constituency, party and nation, but the time has come to turn my hand to other work and pursue other interests that I have. "Playing a role in such an exciting period in the history of Wales and Plaid Cymru has been an absolute privilege. "I have every confidence that the party will go from strength to strength and will continue to put the interests of the people and communities of Wales above all else." </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock £2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <title>Fund under investigation is wound up</title>
      <description>A regeneration fund which is at the centre of an investigation by the Wales Audit Office is wound up by the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>A regeneration fund which is at the centre of an investigation by the Wales Audit Office has been wound up by the Welsh government. Auditors are looking into the sale of 16 parcels of publicly-owned land that were sold for about £20m by the Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales. There are concerns they could have generated much more for the taxpayer. The investigation is focusing on the decision to sell the sites privately rather than by a public auction. This week South Wales Police also said it was considering whether or not an investigation into the sale of land by Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales (RIFW) was required. In a statement, Housing Minister Carl Sargeant said after consultation he was going to draw the investment activities of the fund to a close. He also said the effectiveness of the fund had been seriously damaged by the cumulative impact of investigations and that closing the fund would free up money to be invested in other areas. In March last year the parcels of land, situated across Wales, were sold to a Guernsey-based firm called South Wales Land Developments. Instead of there being an open tendering process, 18 property agents and developers were approached and the sites were bundled together in one portfolio rather than sold individually. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) began an investigation last year. WAO director Mike Usher said: "Welsh government officials have kept the Wales Audit Office informed of developments. "It remains the auditor general's intention to publish the results of his value for money study of the Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales before the end of the calendar year. "As our audit work is ongoing, we are not able to comment more fully at this time." In July, Mr Usher said: "Whilst our study is examining all aspects of RIFW, including its governance arrangements and its oversight by the Welsh government, we are also undertaking a detailed examination of all land disposal transactions and investment decisions. "In particular, our auditors are looking at the RIFW decisions to sell land privately rather than by public auction." The nature of the land varied from farms in Gwynedd to a former industrial site in the Cynon Valley and part of a business park in Newport. But the area with the greatest value was 120 acres (nearly 50 hectares) of farmland near the village of Lisvane on the northern edge of Cardiff which had been in public ownership for many years. The land was sold for an agricultural rate of around £15,000 an acre but four months later it was included in Cardiff council's planning blueprint for new housing. This paved the way for part of that land to become some of the most valuable in Wales with a potential price of around £1m an acre. There is a claw back mechanism which means the taxpayer will be able to share in any increase in its value. That figure has not been revealed but BBC Wales understands that it is not more than 50% of the increase. Another valuable site is 16 acres of land (six hectares) on the outskirts of Monmouth which was valued by the Welsh government at around £1m. Since the sale, a joint planning application has been made to Monmouthshire council by South Wales Land Developments for 370 homes. And in the Bridgend area, a stretch of land was valued at £100,000 near Pyle. Since then, an application has been made to Bridgend council by South Wales Land Developments for 94 homes. While there are claw back mechanisms in place for Lisvane and Monmouth, there are none applying to the other pieces of land. Concerns over the method of the sale were first referred to the auditors by the Conservative assembly member Byron Davies. The land had been in public ownership for many years having been bought by the Land Authority for Wales and the Welsh Development Agency before coming under the control of the Welsh government. It was transferred by the Welsh government to RIFW in 2010, which operates at arms length but was still ultimately controlled by the Welsh government. RIFW had been set up to invest in the regeneration of town centres and was funded by European and Welsh government money. Instead of providing cash directly, the Welsh government funds were generated by RIFW selling off those 16 parcels of land for around £21m. The Welsh government had already suspended the regeneration investment fund and launched two internal investigations before Friday's decision. In the past the Welsh government defended the sale, saying it was in excess of the independent market valuation and the land was bundled up to avoid developers cherry picking the best sites. South Wales Land Developments has said the deal has led to much needed commercial activity on the sites after years in which there was little activity. Both claimed the use of claw back arrangements would reflect any significant uplift in the value of the land. BBC Wales tried to get hold of the spokesman for the wound-up body but has not had a response. </body>

      <title>Firefighters' strike called off</title>
      <description>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales on Saturday has been called off, union bosses say.</description>

      <body>A planned five-hour strike by firefighters in England and Wales has been called off, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said. The union said the decision came after progress in talks over pensions - the strike had been due to take place from 18:30 until 23:30 BST on Saturday. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. The FBU said it had been presented with a deal similar to that in Scotland. This means firefighters will be able to retire on a full pension between the the ages of 55 and 60 if they are genuinely not fit enough and another role cannot be found for them. A member of staff who does meet the fitness standards and chooses to retire early will get a reduced pension. A final agreement has not yet been reached because negotiations will need to take place between ministers and individual fire authorities about how this will be funded. Firefighters in Scotland voted against a strike. The FBU said 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out for four hours when it staged a first round of action last month. Contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <description>Councils work together on £1bn hydro-electric estuary plan</description>

      <body>A hydro-electric project in the Severn Estuary worth more than £1bn could be the first in a series of collaborations between Cardiff and Bristol councils. The two authorities plan to sign a memorandum of understanding once it has been approved by both cabinets. If passed, Cardiff said the first joint initiative could be a twin tidal lagoon. It follows plans for a £25bn barrage being described as "dead in the water" for the time being. Utilising the Severn's tidal range - the second biggest in the world - it is claimed the lagoons could generate enough electricity to power the whole of the region. "Obviously the tidal lagoon is what's catching the headlines today, but that's only part of something much bigger," said councillor Ashley Govier, Cardiff council's cabinet member for environment. "Cardiff and Bristol are both too small to compete on our own with the city-regions of London, Birmingham and Manchester, but we can be big players if we work regionally and collaboratively. "Taking charge of our own green and affordable energy needs is part of that, but also we need to work on housing, transport and a whole raft of issues to make the Severnside area a more attractive place to live and work." The proposed system would see a network of hydro-turbines encased in a concrete wall at either side of the Severn Estuary. The Severnside project is similar to one currently under consideration in Swansea. However, while the Swansea lagoon would provide renewable electricity for 100,000 homes, the Cardiff/Bristol operation is projected to power double that - possibly more if neighbouring authorities came on board. "As the biggest two authorities, Cardiff and Bristol had to take the initiative on this project and on the regional partnership as a whole," added Mr Govier. "But we very much want to bring in our neighbouring authorities, so for us the Vale of Glamorgan, Newport etc and from Bristol's point of view the Somerset authorities." The project would work by harnessing the Severn's tides behind concrete dams. When there is a sufficient difference between the depths on either side of the dam, sluice gates would be opened to release the trapped water, turning turbines and generating the electricity. Mr Govier said that while Cardiff and Bristol were in discussions with several private companies, he hoped it would remain a project which could ultimately benefit taxpayers. "The scale of the tidal lagoon project we're envisaging would cost considerably more than £1bn, so it's obvious that the only way we could achieve it would be with private backing," he said. "But it's not something we'd just sell on, it has to have a tangible benefit for the region and its people. "We could either sell the electricity into the National Grid to raise income and reduce our reliance on taxation, or alternatively we could sell it to a specific electricity supplier with the caveat that it has to be passed on to consumers in the region at a heavily reduced rate." He added: "As a council and a region we need to be doing more to make Severnside an attractive option for business to come to." Hafren Power wants to build an 11-mile (18km) barrage between Lavernock Point near Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, and Brean near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. But in September, barrage supporter and Neath MP Peter Hain said that plans for a £25bn barrage in the Severn Estuary were "dead in the water" in the current Parliament. Mr Hain said the UK government had refused to commit to it. In June, MPs said Hafren had failed to make the case that it would be good for the economy or the environment. </body>

      <body>A BBC studio manager died after falling from a cliff at a well known mountain spot in Snowdonia, it has been confirmed. David March, 36, from Thornton Heath in south London, worked for BBC World Service and had been employed at the corporation for 15 years. Mr March fell up to 330ft (100m) from above Devil's Kitchen in the Ogwen Valley on 12 October. He was an experienced walker who was a regular visitor to Snowdonia. Mr March worked for the languages' production team. He spent most of his career at Bush House, in London, before moving to the World Service's new premises at New Broadcasting House in 2012. Speaking at the time of the incident, Chris Lloyd, from the Ogwen Valley team, said it was "an unfortunate tragic accident" and Mr March may have made a navigational error and walked off a cliff. Devil's Kitchen, or Twll Du (Black Hole) in Welsh, is a very well known route above Cwm Idwal in the Ogwen Valley. It marks a tricky crack in rocks which can be scrambled up to reach the Glyder range of peaks and Y Garn. The route can prove challenging for many walkers, especially if there is poor weather and mist, as the path through the rocks and cliffs is ill-defined. </body>

      <body>Firefighters are warning about the dangers of leaving cooking unattended after two fires in the Conwy area. A 79-year-old man suffered minor burns to his head and arms on Thursday after a chip pan ignited at a property in Llandudno when he had fallen asleep. It followed another call-out to a flat in Colwyn Bay after a fire sparked by an unattended microwave. It comes as North Wales Fire and Rescue Service launches a campaign on cooking safety. "More than half of all accidental dwelling fires we attend in north Wales are cooking related," said Gwyn Jones from north Wales fire service. "The best advice we can give to people is to throw away your old style chip pan - use a thermostatically controlled deep fryer instead which cannot overheat and ignite in the same way. "Never turn your back on cooking, even for a short time, and make sure you have a working smoke alarm." On Friday the fire service launched its "We Don't Want To Come Dine With You" campaign on cooking safety. Over the next few months, fire officers will be offering advice to shoppers in north Gwynedd, as well as handing out kitchen timers and setting a kitchen cooking safety quiz. "Time and time again we attend house fires which have started in the kitchen - it is so easy to forget your cooking, especially if you are tired, distracted or have been drinking," added Mr Jones. "But the consequences can be devastating. We don't want to come dine with you and tackle your kitchen fire." </body>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls. It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country. The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population. Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations. Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils. The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS. Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months. Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn. She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging". The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources. "I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said. "For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households." Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that. "I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me. "I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then." She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week. Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions. She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind. Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending. "The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services. "Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways. The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions". It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services. WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years. "Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised." BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes: It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%. Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before. Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups. They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax. The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money. Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements. A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February. BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes: Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze. Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work. It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that. Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions. But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down. Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council. Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce. But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency. The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private. While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities. Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services. Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations. The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties. Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks. It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples. Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do. Their track record though is far from convincing. In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments. The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well". If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards. Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged. Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations. BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes: The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities. The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund. Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru. Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13. Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment. Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer. </body>

      <title>Fresh barracks death inquest call</title>
      <description>Calls are made for a fresh inquest into the 1995 death of an Army recruit from Denbighshire, one of four at the Surrey barracks within seven years.</description>

      <body>Calls have been made by a human rights group for a fresh inquest into the death of an 18-year-old Army recruit from Denbighshire. Liberty is representing the parents of Cheryl James, from Llangollen, who died in November 1995 at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. She was one of four soldiers who died there between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The attorney general's office said it was considering the application. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995, just months before Pte James's death, also from gunshot wounds. In September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head, and six months later, Pte James Collinson, from Perth, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin. A Surrey Police investigation was launched into the deaths in 2002, following pressure from the families who rejected suggestions the soldiers had committed suicide and called for a public inquiry. Later, a report by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, commissioned by the armed forces minister called for substantial reforms in the training of new recruits. A later investigation by deputy high court judge Nicholas Blake QC called for an independent ombudsman for the armed forces, but rejected the families' calls for a public inquiry. It also concluded that Ptes Gray, James and Benton had committed suicide. An inquest into Pte James' death held shortly after it happened recorded an open verdict. On Friday, Liberty announced it is applying for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. The group said its application to the attorney general comes after using the Human Rights Act to get access to documentation about Pte James' death that her family have never seen, claiming 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs contain evidence that has never before been properly examined and suggesting witnesses may have lied. A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence. If the attorney general gives his consent, the matter will be referred to the High Court for consideration, Liberty said. Legal officer Emma Norton said: "Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. "The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done". Pte James' parents Des and Doreen James added: "We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. "No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. "All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. "The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying for us but we have every confidence in Liberty and our entire legal team." A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty seeking the attorney general's consent to apply for a new inquest into Pte James' death, and it was being considered. </body>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor accused of causing a series of explosions in the town told a jury he "made fireworks, not bombs". John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he did not get a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen, a Liberal Democrat town councillor, denied the prosecution's claim that he created gunpowder for explosions. "No, I didn't make any of the explosions," he told prosecutor Wyn Lloyd Jones. Mr Lloyd Jones asked: "Were you getting a thrill from speaking to the newspaper?" Mr Larsen replied: "No. I was asked to speak to the newspaper." He also denied getting a thrill from appearing on television, claiming he only appeared on screen "for a couple of seconds". Mr Larsen denied setting off an improvised explosive device on 24 March near his home with ball-bearings added as shrapnel. But he has accepted experimenting with fuels for firework rockets in his garden. Mr Larsen told the court he bought chemicals for magic tricks and others for fireworks. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He told the court he performed magic shows for family and friends. But Mr Lloyd Jones suggested none of the items found at his home were related to magic or displays for children. "That's incorrect," Mr Larsen said. "I have been practising magic for a number of years." Mr Lloyd Jones went on: "You have been practising explosions for three months." "No, I haven't. I get fed up of being called a liar," Mr Larsen replied. "I didn't do the explosions." The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards. Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading. It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable". It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings. The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town. Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years. Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately. The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known. It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building. A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building. "We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided." </body>

      <title>How will Welsh councils save cash?</title>
      <description>Wales' 22 local authorities have been told what their individual budgets for next year will be, but what is your council planning to do to make savings?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24525092</url>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government. It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year. Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms. Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16. So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls: Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard. "It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable." Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents. "The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services. "We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future." Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services. "The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course. "We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15. "The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council. Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions. "This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government. "The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner. "We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration. "However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect." A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement. "Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years." Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October. The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years. Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities. The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need. It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils. However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely. Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation. Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched. Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months. Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected. "This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said. "We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further. "However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs. "I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget." Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings. "Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups. "Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected." A spokesperson for Ceredigion Council said the authority will be facing a reduction in funding from the Welsh Government of 4.6%, which is a cash reduction of almost £5m. That reduction is before taking into account the need to increase the existing budget for inflationary increases, additional funding for implementing national pay awards, and budgetary pressures on existing services, which means that the council will need to identify budget savings in the region of £9.5m for 2014/15. Councillor Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of the council, said: "This is the worst ever financial settlement for Welsh Local Authorities and in particular for Ceredigion by some margin. "It is an unprecedented situation for all Welsh local authorities, but is especially challenging for rural councils such as Ceredigion. "We will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services, and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut." In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year. "Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'." A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it. "The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions. "Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months. "Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year. "The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement. "On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas. "We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed." The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is: Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability. "It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling. "These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'. "We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months. "Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position." The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers. A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible." A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15. "Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m. "This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year. "We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents." Councillor Brendan Toomey, the leader of Merthyr Tydfil council, said: "Like the other 22 council's across Wales, Merthyr Tydfil CBC had already started to plan for how we would meet our budget deficit for 2014/15. "While originally working on a - 4% budget cut, in real terms £6.1m deficit, we are now looking at an actual deficit of £3.5m. "Whilst the 2.2% is better than expected, this council will still have to make some very serious and unprecedented cuts which will mean that the services that we deliver to the people of Merthyr Tydfil will look different within the next three to five years. "As always, we will continue to work extremely hard in order to protect the most vulnerable in the community whilst also protecting as many staff within the organisation as possible." Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government. "Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level. "We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population. "We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding. "We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut. "We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years." The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks. Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy. It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services. Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off. Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December. A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon." A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years). A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be. A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000. A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government". "The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson. "The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'. "The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound. "Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk. "A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year." Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales. "As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible. "I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges. "The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting." The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year. It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure. Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending. "We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said. Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15. Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%. "Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16. "We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse. "This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs. "Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care. "The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions. "We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties." Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable. "This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week. "Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m. "Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts. "Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months. "In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services. "My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives. "In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide. "Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities." Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts. Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year. Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year. Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend. Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations. The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017. Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services. Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making. "This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide." He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views." Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea. Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December. The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years. Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered. It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made. The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. "Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions. "We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for." The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall. It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services. It is due to meet to discuss proposals. Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham. "In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care. "But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago. "Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come. "Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult." With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible". The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. "Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required. It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include: </body>

      <description>Swansea City full-back Angel Rangel is wary of the effect appointing a new manager may have on Saturday's opponents Sunderland.</description>

      <body>Swansea defender Angel Rangel has said his side must be aware of the effect that having a new manager will have on Saturday's opponents Sunderland. Gus Poyet was appointed as the Black Cats' new boss last week and the trip to the Liberty Stadium will be his first game in charge of the bottom-placed team. "When you get a new manager in a situation like this all the players are going to give probably an extra 100 per cent," he told BBC Wales' Sport Wales. "They need to prove themselves to him." However the Swans right-back says the visitors will not face a comfortable afternoon. "Swansea is not an easy place to come and hopefully we can play our own game and win it," he said. "We know that at home we haven't won a game for a while so we have to start, because in the Premier League I think the most important thing is the home form and we have to start against Sunderland. "I have seen a few of their games, especially the last one against Manchester United. You can see the players are fighting for their lives and are giving everything they can. "But when you are in that situation at the bottom of the table, because of the pressure you are under, you are not playing with your best qualities and they have been a bit unfortunate. "So I think we are going to have to try to take advantage of that and try to beat them." Swansea are currently 15th in the Premier League table with seven points - which puts them level with the three teams immediately below them including Norwich, who are in the relegation zone. However Rangel is not worried about the side's form so far this season. "I know it looks like not the best of starts but we are realistic. We know that we had a very difficult start against top teams like Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool so obviously that shows you it is difficult to get points against these teams. "But we got a draw against Liverpool and then we beat the teams that we really needed to beat which is Crystal Palace and West Brom. "These are the teams in the same league as us so now we've got a great chance to beat Sunderland and West Ham at home and I think they are two massive games for us." Swansea hope Ben Davies will be fit to face Sunderland but captain Ashley Williams remains doubtful. Both defenders missed Wales's World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium because of hamstring and ankle injuries respectively. More on Sport Wales, Friday at 19:00 BST, BBC Two Wales </body>

      <body>Wales fly-half Rhys Priestland has overcome an injury to be named in the Scarlets team for the Heineken Cup clash against Racing Metro on Saturday. Priestland was forced to sit out training on Tuesday with a sore foot. Racing Metro centre Jamie Roberts is still injured and misses facing his countrymen. But his Wales and British and Irish Lions colleague Dan Lydiate starts in the French side's back-row, while Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton starts. Scarlets make two changes to the side which beat Harlequins last Saturday. Nick Reynolds comes on to the wing to replace the injured Kristian Phillip,s while prop Jacobie Adriaanse takes over from Samson Lee who is suspended for two games after a disciplinary hearing. Lee was cited for an incident that led to his sin-binning in their 33-26 win at Harlequins last weekend after his boot came into contact with Quins scrum-half Danny Care's face at a second-half ruck. Priestland had been described as "borderline" to make the match by head coach Simon Easterby, who said: "He had a stamp on the foot in the week [before the Harlequins game] and as the match went on he was a little bit sore in the foot. On Priestland's performance against Harlequins, Easterby added: "He is back to a level, isn't he? It kind of reminded me a little bit of the Perpignan game a couple of years ago. He is comfortable with how he is playing and he is keen to kick on now." Hooker Ken Owens is still sidelined with an abdominal strain while club captain and back-rower Rob McCusker is out with a calf injury, so Josh Turnbull, Aaron Shingler and John Barclay continue in the back-row. Easterby added: "It's going to be a huge night for us and great for everyone coming to Parc y Scarlets - let's hope our home crowd turn out for our players and lift them like last weekend and enjoy being a big part of another memorable Heineken Cup battle. "There's no doubt last weekend's performance has boosted confidence and spirits and getting a win in Europe was a mental hurdle we needed after last season. But it won't mean anything if we don't perform to a level against Racing. "This is a big opportunity for us to kick on and in front of our home crowd, not fear what big sides with larger resources can bring to this tournament. If we get our house in order and we're at our best, we know we can match the top sides." TEAMS Scarlets: Liam Williams; Nick Reynolds, Jonathan Davies (capt), Scott Williams, Jordan Williams; Rhys Priestland, Rhodri Williams; Phil John, Emyr Phillips, Jacobie Adriaanse, Jake Ball, George Earle, Aaron Shingler, John Barclay, Josh Turnbull. Replacements: Kirby Myhill, Rob Evans, Rhodri Jones, Johan Snyman, Craig Price, Gareth Davies, Steven Shingler, Gareth Maule. Racing Metro 92: Benjamin Lapeyre; Adrien Plante, Henry Chavancy, Alexandre Dumoulin, Juan Imhoff; Jonny Sexton, Laurent Magnaval; Soane Tonga'uiha, Dimitri Szarzewski (capt), Luc Ducalcon, Juandre Kruger, Francois van der Merwe, Wenceslas Lauret, Dan Lydiate, Masi Matadigo.

      <title>Actor's anger over mural demolition</title>
      <description>Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has strongly criticised a council which "destroyed" a mural celebrating the 1839 Chartist uprising in south Wales.</description>

      <body>Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has strongly criticised Newport council which "destroyed" a mural celebrating the 1839 Chartist uprising. The star, who was born in Newport, has written a letter to the South Wales Argus to say: "The political system has let us down." The 35m (115ft) mosaic was demolished this month to make way for a £100m shopping centre, prompting protests. The council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. The diggers moved in to tear down the artwork in a subway off John Frost Square on 3 October, a fortnight after Welsh heritage body Cadw declined to list the mosaic. The council's chief executive Will Godfrey later apologised for not giving councillors advance warning that the mural would be demolished. As workmen chipped away at the mosaic, which was created in 1978, protesters staged an impromptu demonstration. It was followed by a demonstration of about 200 people the following day who were angry at the council's actions. Sheen, star of films including Frost/Nixon, The Queen and the Twilight series, has now written an open letter to the South Wales Argus. In it, he urges people to "stand up for certain values and freedoms and ideals when they come under attack, whether through greed, malice, ignorance or sheer stupidity". He said he felt compelled to write for a number of reasons. "Firstly, the vicious irony of something that was created to celebrate those who risked much for the good of all, being wiped out without consulting the people themselves, and under the auspices of a Labour led city council serving the needs of profit above all else, is both absurd as well as tragic," he said. "That so little was done, or was able to be done, by us, in order to stop this from happening, brings shame to us all." He also urged action to ensure the Chartist movement was not forgotten in the city, urging the community to come together with ideas to replace the mural. "Having done something similar when working on The Passion [a three-day open air play with the community in Port Talbot] a few years ago, I was amazed and inspired by the vision, commitment and resourcefulness of the design students I worked with," he added. "Looking for found materials to work with, along with as much of the original destroyed mural as can be salvaged, could connect the past with the present in a grounded and economical way perhaps." He concluded: "I hope we can make the Chartists proud." Sheen was born in Newport and his family lived in Llanmartin in the county for 12 years before moving to Port Talbot when the actor was five. His father Meyrick Sheen, whose brother still lives in Newport, said he was not surprised his son had gotten involved. He told BBC Wales that Sheen had previously opened a Chartists' exhibition in the city's museum. The council has said it is looking at options to replace the mural, which depicted a fatal confrontation between democracy protesters and troops at Newport's Westgate Hotel in 1839 In his letter earlier this month, Mr Godfrey said he had attempted to contact local media to alert them about the demolition. "The process was not underhand or undemocratic as has been suggested in some parts of the media," he said. He went on: "Officers have advised the appropriate cabinet member that consultation should commence as soon as possible. 'Difficult decisions' "It is suggested that one of the options should be to commission a replica of the original mural." In response to the Hollywood star's letter, Newport council said it did not have the money to move or preserve the mural. "The mural's future has been on public record since March 2012, when a planning decision and separate public consultation confirmed that the mural would have to be demolished and the preferred option as a result of the consultation was for it to be reproduced on tiles," said a spokesperson. "More recently, as Cadw did not list the mural and Newport City Council did not have £625,000 to remove and preserve it, we understand that these decisions have been difficult for Newport residents both near and far. "The council found Mr Sheen's letter very interesting. It is forward thinking and contains some practical suggestions which the council will consider. "We also echo Mr Sheen's call to 'focus on how we can celebrate the past, connect it to the present and look hopefully to the future.' "We are currently asking all members of the public to give us their views on a new commemoration of the Chartists, details of which are on the council's website." </body>

      <body>Cardiff manager Malky Mackay is the "most important factor at this club", according to forward Craig Bellamy. Mackay has been in talks with the City board this week following the departure of his head of recruitment Iain Moody. "He's taken this club on to another level and what he's done has been remarkable," said Bellamy. "We're changing and trying to improve and it's all been down to him. I don't just have respect for him as a manager but also as a person." Mackay led the club into the Premier League for the first time and Bellamy added that the players know where they stand with the 41-year-old. "You have to perform, especially with our manager, because you know if you don't you are coming off at half-time - he's that ruthless!" Bellamy said. The off-the-field problems at the Cardiff City Stadium will not affect the players' preparations for Saturday's game against Chelsea, Bellamy insisted. The 34-year-old has been away in Belgium playing his final game with Wales before retiring from international football, so has been away from things for a few days. But he said: "No-one has really been talking about it. As players you are paid to play and your performances are what you are judged on, so you have to concentrate on that. "If you look from the outside you can look for excuses but that's not the mentality of the club or the players. "We're organised, the manager's gone through Chelsea so we know what we're up against. It was always going to be tough against them regardless of what's happened. "For me I have got a lot to concentrate on. The first thing is to get in the team and then try to keep my place. Then I want to get my performances to a level that I want them to be at. </body>

      <body>Chelsea forward Fernando Torres has recovered from a knee injury but Ashley Cole and Andre Schurrle will miss the visit of Cardiff. Cole is out with the rib injury that caused him to miss England's World Cup qualifiers, while Schurrle picked up a minor injury playing for Germany. Peter Odemwingie is expected to keep his place in the Cardiff attack in preference to Craig Bellamy. Danish striker Andreas Cornelius remains Cardiff's only injury absentee. It's been a week of turmoil in south Wales, and at one point I'm sure the Cardiff fans were concerned they might lose their manager. Football never fails to surprise. But for a 23-year-old to go from doing the painting on work experience  to being Cardiff's acting head of recruitment is undoubtedly one of the stranger stories. Despite that, I don't think the manner in which their former head of recruitment Iain Moody has left the club will have a negative effect on the Bluebirds - quite the opposite in fact. I think the goings-on will strengthen Malky Mackay's standing as manager with the team, and Chelsea will do well to be on their guard on Saturday. Cardiff, after all, emerged from their last trip to south-west London with all three points. There is a wealth of dangerous attacking players on show at Stamford Bridge - and not all of them come from Chelsea. Jordon Mutch scored a fantastic late winner against Fulham, and was also impressive as a substitute in the defeat against Newcastle. What will be equally interesting is how their midfield duo of Aron Gunnarsson and Gary Medel deal with Chelsea's attacking threat. The Blues have seemingly settled down now under Jose Mourinho and, after four unbeaten games on their travels, they'll be looking to maintain their 100% league record at the Bridge. Fernando Torres is fit again, while Willian got off the mark for Chelsea in their 3-1 against Norwich last time out and Juan Mata is seemingly back in favour. Now that the second international break is out of the way, the Premier League will start to take shape - I still believe Manchester City and Chelsea have the best squads. It'll be good to see Chelsea in action, and also Cardiff in a game I believe is a litmus test for their season. Head-to-head Chelsea Cardiff </body>

      <body>South Wales is becoming the UK centre of advanced armour technology for the military, according to Ministry of Defence (MoD) scientists. The UK government has joined forces with Kennametal Manufacturing in Newport to build a £2m facility. The plant will develop full-size ceramic armour plates to be fitted into uniforms and onto vehicles that will help protect troops on the frontline. It is the largest in Europe, helping to sustain 50 jobs at the Newport site. And it is the first facility in the UK that is able to manufacture these products with the MoD and Kennametal hoping it will help boost growth if they can export them to other countries. Richard Brooks, programme delivery director of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is a wing of the Ministry of Defence, said this was part of a 10-year collaboration with Kennametal. "This company's got the right potential, they're willing to invest, they're willing to try risky things, they're willing to innovate - they're a small, agile organisation," he said. "So that's the characteristics we're looking for and that's what this company has given us." It is one of a few companies in south Wales specialising in similar technology. The DSTL is also working with Tata Steel in Port Talbot to develop advanced metallic armour. Manufacturing was once a major employer and source of prosperity in Wales but has faced steep decline. Mike Williams from Kennametal said: "To bring manufacturing industry to Wales is key at the moment. There's so much of it going the other way. "Hopefully, it builds a good foundation for us to grow even further." </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock £2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <title>Flood board 'risked lives' fear</title>
      <description>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs warns.</description>

      <body>The lives and homes of thousands of people could have been put at risk because of poor management at a public body, a committee of AMs has warned. The Caldicot and Wentlooge Internal Drainage Board is responsible for ensuring the Gwent Levels do not flood. The latest criticism follows a Wales Audit Office (WAO) report which said the board misused public funds. AMs said the findings did not reflect on the board's managers now. Its powers are likely to be transferred elsewhere. The Welsh government said it understands appropriate control measures are now in place at the board. The body, which is independent of government, manages drainage systems in an area of low-lying coastal land between Cardiff and Chepstow, south of the M4 and bordered by the Severn estuary. The WAO investigation into the board's 2010/11 accounts found irregularities in the way some senior staff had awarded themselves and others pay rises. It also had evidence that the board went on trips around Europe with "little or no" business case to justify their need. It said that in 2005, 37 people went on a £4,333 three-day inspection visit to Venice, including 13 staff and board members and 21 guests, mainly spouses or relatives. Another excursion to Northern Ireland for 28 people in 2008, which included a visit to a distillery and the Giants Causeway, cost more than £4,700. The Welsh assembly's public accounts committee said events at Caldicot and Wentlooge were "a prime example of how not to run a publicly-funded organisation". In a new report, committee chair Darren Millar AM said: "There were no clear lines of accountability for the board and it was not effectively monitored in developing and implementing a strategic plan for flood-risk management in the Gwent Levels. "We believe that this potentially put the lives and property of thousands of people at risk." The committee report concluded that "poor governance and accountability" led to staffing disputes and infighting at the drainage board. Mr Millar said: "Caldicot and Wentlooge IDB is responsible for managing the appropriate drainage for a strategically critical area of Wales, which encompasses major infrastructure, businesses, farmland and tens of thousands of homes. "The committee believes that the poor governance, accountability and transparency at the board had the potential to put all of that at risk." He also warned that the committee was concerned that the issues at the board may not be unique and urged Welsh ministers to remind other public bodies of their responsibilities. But Mr Millar said the board had taken action to address many of the issues highlighted by the WAO and the report's findings did not reflect on the current management team. There are three internal drainage boards currently operating wholly or mainly in Wales: Caldicot and Wentlooge Levels, which is wholly in Wales; Lower Wye, which is mainly in Wales and partly in England; and Powysland, which is also mainly in Wales and partly in England. Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies said he was now considering merging all three boards with environmental body Natural Resources Wales. In a statement to AMs, he said the issues raised about Caldicot and Wentlooge board do not "reflect the culture or standards of public service that we have a right to expect from any public body". "It is clear from the report that it lacked some of the necessary governance controls, checks and balances that a public body must possess," Mr Davies said "We have already consulted on the future of these bodies and in the consultation we made clear that our preferred option was to transfer the powers of the internal drainage boards to Natural Resources Wales. "I have considered responses to the consultation and have asked officials to look at the costs, benefits and risks of a transfer to Natural Resources Wales, alongside other options. "This work is well advanced, and I expect to announce my decision on the future of these boards in the next month." </body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24566994</url>
      <date>1382009680</date>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown. There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year. The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades". The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995. However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled. The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police. The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded. An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year. Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats. The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen. Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year. The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family. "But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity. "While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable." While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges". He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels. "While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online." Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling. "This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public. "England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues." The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales. </body>

      <description>Preview followed by live coverage of Saturday's Premier League game between Swansea City and Sunderland.</description>

      <body>Swansea pair Pablo Hernandez and Jonathan de Guzman are available after injury, while goalkeeper Michel Vorm has overcome a hand problem. Defender Ben Davies is a doubt because of a hamstring strain, while captain Ashley Williams is still sidelined. Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher will return from a shoulder injury for Gus Poyet's first game in charge. Keiren Westwood, Phil Bardsley and Wes Brown could be fit, but Ki Sung-yueng is ineligible against his parent club. Gus Poyet could have been sat in the opposite dug-out this weekend. He very nearly succeeded Roberto Martinez in the summer of 2009 but lost out to Paulo Sousa. Four years on, the Liberty Stadium is the stage for his first taste of Premier League management. What a job he has on his hands. After the flamboyant, some would say crazy, but certainly unorthodox style of Paolo Di Canio, Poyet inherits a Sunderland side rock bottom after their worst ever start to a season. Already six points adrift of safety having lost their last five games in a row, the road to recovery is a steep one. The Uruguayan's first task is to restore some harmony and confidence to a dressing room seemingly shell-shocked by the antics of the previous incumbent. I'm told Poyet has been working hard on the training ground, particularly on Sunderland's defence which has been so porous and conceded 14 goals in the last five outings. His Brighton side boasted the best defensive record in the Championship last season, suggesting he knows how to shore things up. And if Steven Fletcher returns ahead of schedule after a shoulder injury, attacking options would improve dramatically. Top scorer last season, two of the Scot's 11 league goals came in a 2-2 draw at the Liberty. Surprisingly, only goal difference is keeping Swansea out of the relegation zone. In mitigation they have played four sides from the top six but they do need to sort out their home form if they're to avoid getting sucked in to a season of struggle. The Swans last home win in the Premier League was on 2 March. Eight games since have brought a measly three points. Manager Michael Laudrup sees this match and next Sunday's clash with West Ham as the chance to address that problem and quickly soar up the table. Add another Europa League victory on Thursday against Russia's Kuban Krasnodar for a perfect week and the foundations would be laid for another exciting campaign. Excitement has been in short supply for Sunderland supporters for quite a while now, but for those hardy souls facing the 700-mile round trip from the north-east to south Wales the dullest of goalless draws would be accepted and celebrated as an important first step in the right direction under their new guru Gus.

      <body>Dale McIntosh admitted it was a wrench to leave Pontypridd for his new role as Cardiff Blues defence coach but said he was excited about the challenge. McIntosh spent 24 years with Ponty as player and coach and said: "A lot of thought went into accepting the offer and that is no disrespect to Blues. "It's been very emotional for me, but that is life and you have to move on. "The offer and excitement of this job, the magnitude of the club and the expectation is phenomenal." He added: "This is a very talented squad and our job is to make sure that the talent, together with the ethics and passion goes on to the pitch. "If it does then there is going to be a lot of success here." McIntosh will start his new job on Monday and before that will be at Pontypridd's British and Irish Cup game against London Welsh on Saturday, rather than at Blues Heineken Cup clash against Toulon. "We discussed it and I am a loyal character and it is the right thing to do. "I have had a lot of support and I don't want supporters to think 'He didn't waste his time being out of here', although my heart will be at both games. "It feels very similar to when I moved away from New Zealand with all my family back there. "I feel my heart has been ripped out, but it has been replaced by the challenges which are coming up. "Blues is the right place for me to be at this moment and there are going to be big things on the horizon." Blues coach Phil Davies said: "I've known Dale for a long time as a player and a coach and have a lot of respect for him as a man and a rugby person. "He was someone we looked at last year to come in when I first arrived, but those circumstances didn't allow it. "Now he's here he will make a contribution there is no doubt. "You hear the passion he has got for Pontypridd and I know the loyalty he has got there. "But that will now be transferred to us and that is exciting for the players. "I know I've got a guy I can stand shoulder to shoulder with and we can win and that's what we've been about from day one. "We expect big things from him and I know he will deliver for us." </body>

      <body>Nick Abendanon will make his first appearance of the season and captain Bath against Newport Gwent Dragons in the Challenge Cup. Winger Richard Lane makes a return from injury, along with Matt Banahan, who partners Gavin Henson in the midfield. Dragons captain Andrew Coombs could return from injury off the bench. The Welsh region have made eight starting changes following their opening win over Mogliano. Lyn Jones' side have also lost hooker Sam Parry with concussion and flanker Nic Cudd with a shoulder injury. Centre Jack Dixon faces a long lay-off because of foot surgery. Veteran former Wales lock Rob Sidoli leads the Dragons in Coombs' absence. Hallam Amos moves from full-back to wing with Dan Evans coming in at 15 while Kris Burton and Jonathan Evans drop to the bench as Richie Rees and Jason Tovey return. Hugh Gustafson starts at hooker and Dan Way is as tight head prop while Matthew Screech partners Rob Sidoli in the second row. In last weekend's first round, Bath won 15-6 at French side Bordeaux-Begles , while Dragons beat Italian visitors Mogliano 50-8.

      <body>A police officer has won a national bravery award after he risked his life to save a drowning teenager from a quarry in Carmarthenshire. PC Alun Morgan from the Dyfed-Powys force won the Police Federation prize at a ceremony in London. But despite his efforts in June 2012 at Cilrychen Quarry, Llandybie, 14-year-old Luke Somerfield died. PC Morgan was one of the first on the scene and dived into the water after hearing the screams of upset children. Luke, from Llandeilo, had been in Cilyrychen Quarry with three friends. An inquest into the teenager's death in August last year heard that he became tangled in rope from a lifesaving ring and drowned. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. PC Morgan and his colleagues arrived at the quarry to find it enclosed by an 8ft (2.5m) high chain-link fence, with two lines of barbed wire above and no obvious way to get inside or out. He cut a hole in the fence and asked a worker from a neighbouring engineering firm to cut the chains on the nearby gates so other emergency vehicles could get in. PC Morgan, a former lifeguard, then sprinted to the edge of the quarry lake and, after speaking to witnesses, he tied a rescue line to himself and dived 15ft (4.5m) down to rescue the boy. Luke later died in hospital. PC Morgan, who won the Welsh region police bravery award, said: "It was very tragic and it's bitter sweet to win this award. Sadly the little boy died but we did our best for him as a team. "You don't think about the dangers when you go in, adrenaline kicks in and you just do it. It's only afterwards you start to think about things. "I just wanted to get to the boy as quickly as I could and get him out. I'm very proud and I didn't expect it all." PC Morgan said the Luke Somerfield Memorial Trust had been set up in Luke's memory to educate youngsters about the dangers of water. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Congratulations to PC Morgan for receiving the police bravery award for the Welsh region. "In very traumatic circumstances, knowing the risks involved and despite instructions not to, PC Morgan plunged into treacherous quarry waters. "He risked his own life, determined to save another. PC Morgan's bravery, endurance and dedication to duty cannot be underestimated." </body>

      <description>Fuel duty cut bid for rural areas leaves out Welsh communities</description>

      <body>An application for a 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in rural areas will not include anywhere in Wales. Only three towns in England and seven in Scotland passed the criteria for inclusion in the bid to the European Commission (EU). The cut already applies to Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly. Ceredigion's Liberal Democrat MP Mark Williams said he was disappointed but the price guide set by the EU was "very high". "I am very disappointed to see that Ceredigion, nor anywhere in Wales, has been included in the list of places in the UK which the Treasury will put forward to the EU for a fuel rebate," he said. "Having collected data from all of Ceredigion's petrol stations and submitted the evidence to the Treasury, the price guide set by the EU was very high, with some petrol stations in Ceredigion only reaching it on one or two days over the time frame set and others not reaching it at all. "Whilst this is disappointing, the Treasury needs the supporting data in order to make the case to the EU. "I remain convinced the prices we pay are disproportionately high and we must continue to make the case to the Treasury and the EU for the extension of this scheme." Seven of the towns for which the application is being made are in Scotland. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. In England, Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. </body>

      <body>Twenty years ago, as England stuttered towards World Cup qualification failure under the haunted gaze of Graham Taylor, a technically inferior English football was readying itself for another harsh winter in Europe. Still struggling to overcome the effects of a five-year ban from European competition following the Heysel disaster - and despite the formation of the Premier League a year earlier - English clubs' prospects in Europe did not look good. Inaugural Premier League winners Manchester United would go on to be knocked out in the Champions League second round by Galatasaray. English football, more than ever, needed a spark. It got one from the most unlikely source. Norwich City, third-placed finishers in the 1992-93 season despite a negative goal difference, found themselves in Europe for the first time in their history thanks to Arsenal's FA Cup and League Cup double. The Canaries' expectations were not high. But after beating Dutch side Vitesse in the Uefa Cup first round, Norwich would go on to stun German giants Bayern Munich in the city's famous Olympic Stadium, an achievement to rank alongside the greatest - and most surprising - results in the history of British clubs abroad. It is a match, played on 19 October 1993, that is lodged firmly in the minds of a generation of football fans for the sheer unlikelihood of it all, as well as for John Motson's famous commentary line: "This is almost fantasy football." The fantasy football was played largely by Jeremy Goss, whose sublime volley gave the Canaries the lead en route to a 2-1 first-leg victory in Germany, a result followed by a 1-1 draw at Carrow Road, with Goss again the Canaries' scorer. "I can still feel the ball hitting my foot now," Goss says of his goal in Munich, capitalising on a poor defensive clearance from West Germany's World Cup-winning captain Lothar Matthaus. "It was such a sweet strike. "Luckily for me, I am remembered as the man who scored that goal against that team in that cup game. I had a couple of minutes in the big time of mass media exposure and I revelled in it, for the simple reason that it took so many years of hard work and disappointment to get to that level." Goss and his team-mates did not achieve their success against a poor Bayern side either. With Matthaus their lynchpin and Jan Wouters fresh from helping the Netherlands end England's World Cup dreams, the Bavarians would go on to win the Bundesliga title. Norwich, though, were undaunted by the task facing them - to become the first English team ever to win at the Olympic Stadium. "We thrived on the big stage," adds Goss. "We were desperate to play in the Olympic Stadium. The pitch was gorgeous - like a billiard table." That Norwich were the English team to flourish that year should perhaps not have been such a surprise. Led by manager Mike Walker, the Canaries introduced a continental sweeper system to their Premier League campaign, using the versatile Ian Culverhouse, flummoxing opponents at home and on the continent. In England, teams lined up as they had done for years, unable to fathom Norwich's tactics. Teams abroad were simply taken by surprise that a backwater English club had embraced such progressive ideas. "The Munich win wasn't a surprise to us - we were that confident and were playing so well in the Premier League at the time," says Goss, whose first-leg volley was followed by a Mark Bowen header. "The manager couldn't get us off the training pitch because we loved it so much. "It was just a terrific side. The belief, the strength and confidence I got in my game came from the people around me. There was Bowen's second goal, Ian Crook's fantastic crosses and goalkeeper Bryan Gunn's magnificent save in the dying moments of the game, when [Munich's Adolfo] Valencia had a free header." Gunn, City's first-choice goalkeeper from 1986 to 1998, recalls the shock among the players on the night. "The fact we were 2-0 up in the first 20 minutes… we were looking around at each other saying 'this is too easy'," he said. "We had read about things in the press beforehand - we were classed as country bumpkins. Whether that was lost in translation or not I don't know, but we went through and showed our steeliness. And it's an achievement that will never be surpassed now Bayern have moved to the Allianz Arena." Goss adds: "Bayern underestimated us. Lothar Matthaus, as captain of Germany, most certainly underestimated us. They couldn't cope with us; they couldn't cope with our work ethic. "In the press, Bayern said the first game was a fluke, and that the real Bayern Munich would turn up. Matthaus said Bayern would qualify." That, of course, did not happen, and the day lives on in the memory - both for the result and Motson's "fantasy football" line. "Fantasy football? I can't remember whether I said it because of the Fantasy Football television programme or not," Motson says. "I probably didn't. I suppose the fantasy was the fact Norwich were in that position at all. "After the Heysel ban it took a while for English clubs to re-establish themselves. I think you could say Norwich's run and their victory in Munich proved to be a stepping stone to English clubs being accepted again." The fantasy was short and sweet - Norwich were knocked out in the next round by Inter Milan, beaten 1-0 in both legs. But 20 years on, with England this time safely qualified for the World Cup finals and Manchester United well set in yet another Champions League group stage, they might want to give a nod to an unheralded Norwich City side who feared no-one and surprised everyone. </body>

      <title>Is shedding councils a way to save?</title>
      <description>Will cutting numbers save as much as people expect?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24582160</url>

      <body>Councils the length and breadth of Wales are now trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. The option of reducing the number of local authorities, perhaps drastically, seems an obvious one. First Minister Carwyn Jones has again stated, in interviews with the BBC and the Western Mail, that 22 councils is too much, and he looks forward to seeing the recommendations of a commission considering the matter, which is due to report at the end of the year. Earlier this week, senior Cardiff councillor Russell Goodway suggested some councils could go bust as the impact of budget cuts mount, raising the prospect of the numbers falling regardless of any deliberate reorganisation. While Wales might not have been here before in terms of the scale of the financial cutbacks, the business of restructuring local councils is quite a well-trodden path. The current 22 councils were created in the mid-1990s. They replaced a two-tier structure made up of district and county councils, which had been established by another local government reorganisation in 1974. Two decades ago it was argued single, unitary authorities were more efficient - cutting out a layer of bureaucracy and making it simpler for people to understand who was providing their public services. No longer did one council empty your bins while another local authority educated your child. The argument was that if you had a complaint you knew where to go. Now it is said that many of these councils are just too small to deal with areas such as education and social services, although it isn't just the smaller authorities that have been criticised for the quality of their services in these two crucial areas. Prof Steve Martin and the team at Cardiff Business School's Centre for Local and Regional Government Research know a thing or two about these matters, having looked at evidence from council reorganisations around the globe. "Usually, when people undertake them, they hope for and anticipate quite significant cost savings," he said. "Studies in Australia, Canada and England show that whilst you can get cost savings, particularly in the longer term, they've never been on the scale that people have hoped for. "So one lesson, not to be too gloomy about this, is not to over expect in terms of cost savings." Prof Martin says it takes around five years for reorganisations to bed down. Restructuring which has taken place in England was slightly different from what might happen in Wales, involving two-tier authorities becoming unitary councils, but he says there was often evidence of a "performance dip" in the short term. So, while the savings can take time to appear, the hiatus of reorganising a council, turning it into a new organisation, people applying for their own jobs and so on tends to affect authorities' ability to run services as well as they might. "You overlay on that the very difficult financial environment that we're in at the moment and all of that says, therefore, that this is not something to be undertaken lightly." "Having said all of that, it's pretty clear that there are some authorities in Wales that have struggled in recent years, and the number of interventions that the government has initiated sort of bears testimony to that, and so does some of the performance data. "And therefore it would be wrong to say that we can be confident that the current 22 are performing as well as we might want them to". Yet Prof Martin says it isn't clear whether big, small or medium is the right size for a local authority. Some sizes are better for some services but not for others - one of the reasons why we used to have two different sizes of councils, in addition to community councils. "Do you want local government to continue to be responsible for education and social care - because if you don't then that drives you towards a pretty large number of small authorities - if you do there is quite a compelling case for a smaller number of larger authorities?" he said. Prof Martin reckons Wales is roughly the size of two or three large English county councils, in population terms, so does it makes sense for us to have 22 of them? "There are quite a lot of countries where governance is working quite well - some of the Scandinavian countries would have far larger numbers of councils which are smaller," he said. "But they are not responsible for education and social services - education and social services would be run by a higher tier of government - either a state-level government or the national government or county councils." Debating whether our local government structure is right or wrong has long been a past time for people like me who probably should get out more. Whatever is decided in Wales, the hope is that we won't be returning to these arguments soon after any changes are finally made. But it would take a braver man than me to bet on that being the case. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Ship trackers 'vulnerable to hacks'</title>
      <description>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacks and exploitation, security experts warn.</description>

      <body>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacking, security experts have warned. Weaknesses in outdated systems could allow attackers to make ships disappear from tracking systems - or even make it look like a large fleet was incoming. Researchers at Trend Micro said their findings showed the danger of using legacy systems designed when security was not an issue. But one vessel-tracking specialist said spoof attempts could be easily spotted. Lloyd's List Intelligence's Ian Trowbridge said that in addition to the vulnerable technology - known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) - other measures could be used to identify marine activity. "The spoofing would immediately be identified by [Lloyd's List Intelligence] as a warp vessel," he said, "providing unexplained position reports outside of the vessel's speed/distance capability and thus subject to further investigation and validation." The AIS system is used to track the whereabouts of ships travelling across the world's oceans. For ships over a certain size, having AIS fitted is mandatory under international maritime law. It is designed to transmit data about a ship's position, as well as other relevant information, so that movements can be seen by other boats as well as relevant authorities on shore. One other use is to alert nearby ships when a man or woman is overboard - an alert that can easily be spoofed, says Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson. "It boils down to the fact that the protocol was never designed with security in mind," he told the BBC. "There's no validity checking of what's being put up there." Using equipment bought for 700 euros (£600), the researchers were able to intercept signals and make vessels appear on the tracking system, even though they did not exist. In one example, the team was able to make it look as if a ship's route had spelled out the word "pwned" - hacker slang for "owned". The information broadcast by AIS is public - but when the system was first put in use, in the early 1990s, the technology required to receive the information was prohibitively expensive for those not directly involved in the industry. But now, a typical internet connection can be used to see the locations of boats, as well as an indicator of what type of cargo they may be carrying. There has been speculation that Somali pirates have been making use of the system. "It has long been thought that the pirates are basically using AIS as a shopping list," Mr Ferguson said, "seeing what's coming into local waters, and what cargo it may have." However, Lloyd's List Intelligence noted that captains are permitted to disable AIS if they feel their crew could be endangered by it. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>

      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "The Coverage Checker offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <title>Google shares hit record highs</title>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is 6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile makers. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

      <body>The head of Europe's crime fighting agency has warned of the growing ability of organised crime groups to mount cyber-attacks in drug trafficking operations. The director of Europol, Rob Wainwright, has told the BBC that along with online drug selling, the internet has become "a primary facilitator of the international drug trafficking business". His comments follow a cyber-attack on the Belgian port of Antwerp, in which drugs traffickers are alleged to have recruited hackers to breach IT systems which controlled the movement and location of containers. Prosecutors say the cyber-attack allowed them to steal entire containers in which cocaine and heroin had been hidden. Danny Decraene from the Antwerp organised crime unit of the Belgian Federal Police has been telling the BBC's Tom Bateman how the hackers are thought to have breached IT systems. </body>

      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <title>Rise of the drone hobbyists</title>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>
      <date>1381823426</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70483000/jpg/_70483141_untitled-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24441931</url>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives. "I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. "I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. "We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there." This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with." So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. "I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries." They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. "Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. "I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time." Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. "It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says. "I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. "However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall." Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS." "When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me." He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). "I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says. "It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. "So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could." Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. "I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. "I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. "Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. "Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. "It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software." After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. "I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. "Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics." He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. "Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states. "Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. "It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. "I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. "I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound." McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. "I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee. "I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive." At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. "I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. "[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me." She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. "He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. "I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. "When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened." McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. "Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains. "Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. "When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. "What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. "What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. "All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. "One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says. "And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out." Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. "I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says. "Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. "It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. "I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John." Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more." That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. "The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. "The government does from time to time. "I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. "Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so." McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. "The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says. "He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. "There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that." In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance. "I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this. "Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer." McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. "I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls. "All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. "You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that." Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest". "I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. "When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. "How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me." She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. "I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee. "We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment." A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. "After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says. "But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred." McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. "Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC. "The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize." So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. "There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says. "Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent." That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. "If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. "You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24564375</url>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Badger cull falls short of target</title>
      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries. You can see more images by clicking here. Some viewers may find the last photo in the gallery distressing. The WPY exhibition opens on Friday 18 October at the Natural History Museum. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <body>Scientists are asking for the public's help to track the spread of a greedy slug species threatening to eat its way through British gardens and crops. The Spanish slug was first reported in the UK in January by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. It can survive many slug pellets, eats crops spared by native species and tolerate drier conditions. A red-brown colour, pale or rich, can identify a suspected Spanish slug. Scientists fear it could breed with our native species to form a hybrid. The Iberian invader, Arion vulgaris, can reproduce in greater numbers and has unappealing habits, including eating dead animals and excrement. During the winter, many disappeared underground or died but their eggs survived and the species may have returned in greater numbers. Scientists are asking people to look for the slugs under logs and plant pots in their gardens, and record and photograph their findings using a dedicated SlugWatch website. "We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug has become," said Dr Bedford. "The reports may also give us an idea of whether it is breeding with our native species to form a hybrid combining the worst of the Spanish slug with tolerance to frosts and cold from our own species." Keith Norman, technical director of farming company Velcourt, said farmers were using up their entire allowance of slug pellets early in the season, leaving no other means of control. "It is a disaster waiting to happen if the Spanish slug proliferates and establishes itself in the UK," said Mr Norman. "The Spanish slug causes more eating damage and cannot be controlled with existing measures." The Slugwatch website was designed by Rachel Ayers, 17, a sixth-former at at Notre Dame High School. Norwich. She also designed cards identifying different species of slug for use in schools. "We want people to survey their gardens, local areas and school grounds for slugs, or they can build a trap using instructions on the site," she said. "One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning about slugs and how to identify them," said Rachel. There are 30 native species in the UK, four of which are classed as pests: the netted or grey field slug, the garden slug, the keeled slug and the large black slug. Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem. They are natural composters, breaking down vegetation, and provide food for hedgehogs, toads and some garden birds. "We hope that as well as helping with research into the Spanish slug, people will learn a bit about the biology of these molluscs," said Dr Bedford. "You never know, we may even help inspire someone to become a malacologist in the future." </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Air pollution 'still harming health'</title>
      <description>Some pollutants continue to pose a "significant threat" to European citizens' health and the environment, says a report by the European Environment Agency.</description>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <body>A major archaeological dig in Wiltshire has unearthed evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, 8,000 years before France, it has been claimed. The team, which consists of Mesolithic period experts, also found other types of food including salmon and nuts. David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, said people living there thousands of years ago were eating a "Heston Blumenthal-style menu". The team hopes to confirm Amesbury as the UK's oldest continuous settlement. The dig will run until 25 October. It is being filmed and made into a documentary by the BBC, Smithsonian, CBC and others to be screened at a later date. The project is being led by the University of Buckingham. Mr Jacques added: "This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?" The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum. He examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the Mesolithic era. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created. "No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area," he said. "There must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, may well be it. "I believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most significant Mesolithic home base ever found in Britain." He added: "Currently Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the UK with Amesbury 104 years younger. "By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered." The site already boasts the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north west Europe. The term Mesolithic refers to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic periods. </body>

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

      <body>Six years ago astronomers launched a new "citizen science" project on the Today programme known as Galaxy Zoo. It was considered a success - harnessing the power of the laptop and mobile phone to help scientists crunch vast sets of data and sort and classify distant galaxies. Since then, there has been a huge surge of public participation in "citizen science" projects - from counting birds in gardens, to spotting exo-planets in the data sent back from the Kepler space telescope. The Today programme's science correspondent Tom Feilden examines the trend for involving amateurs in research projects, and asks whether it is real science or just good PR.

      <body>Young bonobos that are are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from psychological studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. It is published in the journal PNAS. Among their hours of footage, the researchers captured this clip showing one of the "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug another juvenile that had just been attacked. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24466042</url>
      <date>1381536819</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70385000/png/_70385861_vlcsnap-2013-10-09-11h43m13s97.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."
