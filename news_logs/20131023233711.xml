      <body>A grandmother has spoken for the first time about her horrific experience of being dragged under a van during a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Matthew Tvrdon's eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killed Karina Menzies and injured 17 as he used his van as a "weapon" targeting women and children. A year on from the incident, Jill White told BBC Radio Wales she had undergone 13 operations and was in a wheelchair. She had been at a petrol station when Tvrdon randomly attacked. Tvrdon admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act in June this year. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. On 19 October 2012, Ms White had been shopping with her mother, her grand-daughter and daughter, and was filling her car with fuel at the Asda supermarket petrol station in Leckwith when Tvrdon pulled up next to her. He left his van and randomly started hitting the side of her vehicle with a steering lock, which led to Ms White's mother suffering a heart attack in the car. "Apparently, I came round the front of the car to look at the damage," she said. "I must have said to him 'What do you think you're doing' and he put his foot down and drove straight at me. "I went backwards... he knocked me straight unconscious. He drove over my body. "My daughter was screaming and running after him. He stopped because people were beeping their horns and trying to stop him from getting out of the garage. He reversed back, my body dropped, and then he drove back over me again." She described how she was still under the van and being dragged out to the main junction as her daughter chased after the van screaming 'my mother's under the van'. "He stopped at the junction and my body dropped and my daughter thought I was dead. She was on top of me seeing if I was alive, screaming. "He came back at the two of us and drove over the both of us, then dragged the both of our bodies a further 50 yards, I think it was." Ms White and her daughter were the last people to be injured during the day's events before police were able to stop and arrest Tvrdon at nearby Llandough. She said her life would never be the same again. Last Saturday a service took place at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely to mark the first anniversary of Karina Menzies's death and the series of hit-and-runs. Ms Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. A memorial party was held last Friday evening by Ms Menzies's sister Samantha who is now bringing up the girls. </body>

      <title>Confusion over HS2 cash for Wales</title>
      <description>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project.</description>

      <body>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project. Finance Minister Jane Hutt has told AMs there was a £35m budget increase coming in 2015-16 as a result of £832m UK expenditure on HS2. But the UK Treasury has categorically denied this, saying that HS2 spending is not being passed on. Ms Hutt is now facing calls for an urgent clarification amid claims she may have misled AMs. The issue of whether Wales should receive additional funding from the HS2 rail project has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. It would have meant around £35m extra for Wales in 2015-16 and set a precedent for potentially billions more over the lifetime of the project. But the Treasury said the Welsh government's claim was mistaken - and HS2 was excluded from what is known as "Barnett consequentials". Under that process, if extra money is spent on projects in England in services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, Wales receives a slice of extra money too. That process would normally include transport spending - but not in the case of HS2, according to Treasury officials. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: "At the spending round, Wales received Barnett consequentials in the normal way; this excluded funding for HS2. "The government is clear HS2 will be a vital part of our national infrastructure, boosting regional growth across the country and providing vital capacity the UK needs to compete in the global race. "As with any government spending Barnett consequentials will be considered at the next spending review." A spokesperson for the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: "It is crucial that the finance minister clarifies this issue as soon as possible because if what the Treasury says is true, the finance minister has misled the finance committee. "Assembly members expect the information provided to them by the Welsh Government to be accurate and correct." Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <description>French travellers leave a hospital car park where they took over spaces reserved for medical staff.</description>

      <body>French travellers have left a hospital car park they have occupied since Saturday, blocking spaces reserved for medical staff. The travellers were warned to move from the Royal Gwent in Newport by Tuesday or face legal action. However, some of the 13 caravans remained - and it was only at about 16:00 BST on Wednesday that a procession of vehicles began leaving. One traveller told BBC Wales they had been waiting for a car to be fixed. The travellers, who said they were en route to a funeral, arrived at the 300-space car park on Saturday, taking up 65 spaces. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away from the car park on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After the 16:00 BST deadline passed on Tuesday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was passing the matter to their legal department. However, hospital security staff remained in place at the car park monitoring the situation until the vehicles began to leave on Wednesday afternoon. A hospital spokesman overseeing the travellers as they left said: "It is good news that the situation has been dealt with peaceably." One of the travellers, Ringo Gogan, earlier told the BBC the convoy stopped in the hospital car park on Saturday because of a problem with a vehicle and were waiting for it to be repaired before leaving for France. </body>

      <title>Broadband firm grants suspended</title>
      <description>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm are suspended after complaints about a patchy service.</description>

      <body>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm have been suspended. It follows complaints from ResQNet customers that they had been left with a patchy and inconsistent service. The Cross Hands company has received almost £900,000 in public cash from a government scheme to provide high-speed internet access in so-call 'not-spots'. ResQNet vowed to upgrade its network by the end of October. Grants for other broadband providers are not affected. The firm received funding as part of the Wales Broadband Support Scheme, which makes £1,000 grants available to households unable to access broadband connections. The money is typically paid directly to suppliers, so residents do not have to pay up front for equipment and connection costs. Customers from various parts of Carmarthenshire have told BBC Wales they were promised broadband connection speeds of around 5Mbps by ResQNet, but say they have faced a disrupted and a patchy service in recent months. John Sydney, from Taliaris near Llandeilo, said he had now cancelled his subscription to ResQNet because of his frustration with the service. He said he was pleased with the internet speed initially being provided by ResQNet, but then the broadband connection deteriorated around six months ago. "We've had very, very slow speeds and a lot of disconnections," he said. "It's on and off all the time. All of a sudden you couldn't do things online... it was quite frustrating." He said the Welsh government "should be checking on the supplier... to make sure he's fulfilling his part of the contract". Another customer, Roger Thomas, from Cwmdu near Llandeilo, has gone back to using an old, and slower service, because he said ResQNet was too unreliable. "£24 pounds a months is a lot of money for a service that doesn't work," he said. BBC Wales has been made aware of more problems with services in the village of Llanedi, between Cross Hands and Pontarddulais. ResQNet's own website indicates a series of technical problems and upgrades to the service, while a Facebook page has been set up by frustrated ResQNet customers. The company declined to be interviewed by BBC Wales, but in a statement said work would soon be completed to increase network capacity and upgrades to the wireless network. ResQNet director Clive Downey said that the internet usage they were experiencing was "was way beyond what we expected". In its statement, the company added: "We appreciate there have been service issues on parts of our network due to the increased need for bandwidth combined with the success of the service. "The planned increase in the capacity of the network has been delayed but its implementation by the end of October will help alleviate the current issues for the customers affected. ResQNet said it was a "small, innovative business" that over the last two-and-a-half years had provided broadband services where other "major players have failed". "We are committed to continue this trend and overcome the obstacles that will come along from time to time by continued investment and innovation and provide broadband users in west Wales with real choices," it added. "We are also more aware of its limitations and our business strategy will now reflect this new found knowledge whilst being very aware of the importance this service is to the areas concerned. The company said customers affected by the current issues would be compensated under the terms of their contract, and some had already been paid. The Welsh government said it was "unacceptable" that customers had been let down, after it had paid £892,000 in grants to residents and businesses who had identified ResQNet as their broadband service provider. A Welsh government spokesperson said it was working with ResQNet to ensure it fulfilled contractual obligations, adding that there was a "mechanism to recover funding under certain circumstances". </body>

      <body>An 81-year-old church minister has been arrested in south west Wales over an allegation of historical child abuse. Gwyn Ieuan Morgan from Johnstown, Carmarthen, has been suspended from duties at his two chapels pending the outcome of a police investigation. Dr Geraint Tudur, general secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, said members were "naturally traumatised". Dyfed Powys Police said the minister had been bailed while inquiries continue. Mr Morgan has served Bryn Iwan Chapel, near Cynwyl Elfed, and Moreia Chapel in Blaenwaun, north of St Clears, since 1972. Dr Tudur said: "As a charity which offers our members legal and pastoral support, we advised the churches involved to suspend their minister at once, pending the outcome of the investigation. "This advice was immediately acted upon by church trustees. "The church members are naturally traumatised by this development and the union is giving them continuing pastoral support." A statement from the group added: "The union has no power to enforce CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks and registration, although it regularly and strongly urges local churches to ensure that the procedure is followed." Dyfed Powys Police confirmed that "an 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with an historic allegation of sexual activity with a minor". "He remains on bail while inquiries continue," the force added. </body>

      <description>Waiting times for cancer treatment improve but health boards are still failing to meet the target for treating the most urgent cases.</description>

      <body>Waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales have improved according to the latest figures. However, all Welsh health boards are still failing to meet the Welsh government's target for treating the most urgent cases. Figures for August show that 88.6% of urgent cancer patients had started definitive treatment within 62 days of diagnosis - up from 84.5% in July. The target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in that time scale. Conservative Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: "Any improvement is a step in the right direction but it is clear that more progress is urgently required. "This is a critically-important target that hasn't been met in five years." Figures for August released by the Welsh government on Wednesday also show 98.5% of patients started treatment within 31 days through the non-urgent route, compared to 98.2% the previous month. There was a small improvement in waiting times for other cancer cases. But none of the six health boards that provide cancer care met the Welsh government's target of providing definitive treatment for the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days. This target has not been met on an all-Wales basis for several years. Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying experience. "It is appalling that people are being forced to wait over two months until the start of their treatment." Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones said despite some signs of improvement, waiting times for people with cancer remained "unacceptable". "A Plaid Cymru government would provide all cancer patients with a specialist cancer nurse to guide them through treatment and rehabilitation," she said. A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We welcome the improvement in the number of patients being seen within the target time of 31 days and the continued achievement of this waiting times target. "The 62 day performance continues to improve. There are challenges which LHBs [local health boards] continue to address so that this target can be achieved at a sustainable level. These figures show a move in the right direction." </body>

      <title>Wales pool pulled as Paralympic base</title>
      <description>The Wales National Pool will no longer be the base for elite Paralympic swimmers, the sport's governing body announces.</description>

      <body>The Wales National Pool will no longer be the base for elite Paralympic swimmers, the sport's governing body has announced. British Swimming will relocate athletes to Manchester in a move to centralise training after what was seen as a poor performance at London 2012. The Swansea pool board has asked the Welsh and UK governments, along with UK Sport, to get the decision reversed. Its chair Anne Ellis has called it a "significant blow". The Swansea pool has produced medal winning swimmers such as Ellie Simmonds and Dave Roberts. The Manchester pool will be known as the National Performance Centre and the body's new head coach, Rob Greenwood, took up his role on Monday. British Swimming said the move north will give athletes greater levels of support. National performance director Chris Furber said: "A review took place to ensure that we were providing athletes with the best support and services within their daily training environments. "The decision was made, as we move forwards towards Rio [2016 Games], we would have one national performance centre where we will have the very best support and services that athletes require. "We will continue to work with Swim Wales regarding the support that athletes receive in Wales and how we can also support their talent programmes." The South Wales Evening Post newspaper quoted a letter from the Wales National Pool's chairwoman Anne Ellis to politicians. It read: "The decision to stop using the excellent pool facilities in Swansea as a base for elite Paralympics swimming is a significant blow to disability sport provision in Wales." She added this was "particularly disappointing not only because of the exceptional track record developed by Swansea, but also it now means that all elite Paralympic swimmers from Wales will have to travel to Manchester if they want to be in the GB National Squad. "This also means the pool loses out on income from elite training and the coaching excellence developed in the field of Paralympics swimming is under threat." British Swimming's budget was cut after the London Olympics. A spokesperson for Sport Wales said: "Our central focus continues to be that talented Welsh swimmers are able to reach their potential and have access to high level coaching and support. We will be discussing how Swim Wales and British Swimming can achieve this with the help of our investment and resources." Swim Wales said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision. "Of course we understand that difficult decisions have to be made on how to use limited funding, but the results achieved from Swansea consistently over a number of years speak for themselves, including performances at London 2012 and the recent IPC World Championships. "There is still a key role for Swansea and Swim Wales to play in the disability swimming performance pathway. Discussions are ongoing on how the centre at Swansea fits into these plans leading to the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games." </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>The broadcasting watchdog finds BBC and ITV programmes in breach of its rules after a Tory peer was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations surrounding a north Wales home.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <body>A jury in the trial of a former Denbigh mayor accused of causing explosions in the town has been sent home after retiring to consider its verdict. John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he made fireworks and denied getting a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. At the start of his trial, the jury was told that in February this year a series of small explosions occurred in Denbigh which damaged a number of cars. It led to a "main explosion" on 24 March when a device, akin to a bomb, was placed under a Land Rover Discovery in the town. The explosion damaged the vehicle, along with one parked beside it, while ball-bearings and shrapnel from the device were thrown "far and in all directions", the court heard. "Windows were smashed. These events brought fear to the local community," said prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones. The prosecution said it believed Mr Larsen was behind the explosions as they stopped after he was arrested on 19 April. The former mayor denies three arson charges, one of causing an explosion and two of possessing explosives - one with intent to endanger life. Mr Larsen said he made "fireworks, not bombs". </body>

      <body>A Chinese company's plans for a £50m luxury tourist village in Carmarthenshire have been shelved. Maxhard Ltd wanted to build a 100-bed hotel and 80 holiday homes with a swimming pool on a 22-acre (9 hectares) site near Llandeilo aimed at "a select international clientele". It expected to attract 20,000 visitors a year, but was criticised for its "inappropriate" design. A smaller scheme is being considered but no decision has been made. The developers said they intended to submit revised plans in June of this year, but the scheme's architect Julian Castle told BBC Wales they are no further forward and no revised plans had been submitted. He added the project could "possibly" go ahead or it "possibly won't". "There hasn't been much encouragement from the Welsh government, although there has been a lot of local interest," he told BBC Wales. "At present the plan is on hold and due to the financial climate it's difficult to say whether or not it will be completed." The Llandeilo plan, which included 10 shops and a car park, aimed to create up to 70 full-time jobs. Maxhard, which has offices in London and China, said it would have been a "luxurious development for a select international clientele looking to enjoy a tranquil Welsh retreat". It would have been on the doorstep of Pantglas Hall, where a separate resort offers timeshare log cabins, a restaurant and leisure facilities. Managers of the neighbouring Pantglas Owners' Club had concerns about the scale of the tourist village. Eifion Bowen, head of planning at Carmarthenshire council, said there had been discussions to amend the design. "While the application has been withdrawn, the authority is available at any time to discuss a revised application," he said. A Welsh government spokesperson added: "We had been in discussions with the developer and were awaiting full details of their scheme, which would be subject to usual planning consents." </body>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <description>Around 5,500 rare fish are released into a Snowdonia lake in an ongoing programme to restock declining numbers.</description>

      <body>Around 5,500 rare Arctic charr fish have been released into a Snowdonia lake to help restore their numbers. The Arctic charr population at Llyn Padarn, Llanberis, has been dropping over a number of years with some blaming poor water quality. It is the fourth year that juvenile charr have been released into the lake. In previous years the fish have also been restocked at Llyn Crafnant, near Trefriw, Conwy, developed as a back-up source of charr for Llyn Padarn. However, new stock will not be introduced into Crafnant this year as Natural Resources Wales (NRW) officers are monitoring populations in the lake to see if previous restocking efforts have been successful. "We're committed to ensuring the future of the iconic Arctic charr population in Llyn Padarn and we've put great effort into restocking thousands of fish over the years," said NRW spokesman Tim Jones. "At the same time, we're continuing to work with Dwr Cymru Welsh Water and others to find ways to improve water quality in the lake and create a better habitat for the charr to survive." A breeding programme has been set up at NRW's Mawddach hatchery in a bid to protect the rare fish, which can only be found in a few cold, deep lakes in north Wales. In July a report confirmed that nutrients from sewage effluent had damaged the water quality at Llyn Padarn following an incident in 2009. NRW said the nutrients also caused a toxic algal bloom which closed the lake for weeks at a time. Stricter limits have since been imposed on a local sewage works. </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <body>People moving into Wales should be more tolerant of the wishes of local people who support wind turbines, an AM says. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the chair of the assembly's environment committee, was commenting on bitter rows about wind energy plans on the Llyn peninsula. As part of a BBC Wales Taro 9 investigation he says some incomers should "learn to work with" locals. But opponents of turbines say they would be as destructive as the flooding of valleys to create reservoirs. The programme being shown on S4C examines wind turbine developments and proposals on the Llyn Peninsula. Lord Elis-Thomas, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, believes more green energy should be produced, and people moving to Wales should not object so strongly. He told the programme: "I've noticed that there are a number of people who have moved into Wales who vocally oppose stopping Wales developing natural resources and I think this is something very serious. "Because if people move to an area to live, they must learn to work with the people in that area and the economy of this area is vitally important to us all." While some claim wind turbines benefit local communities, the programme also hears from opponents like Sian Parri of the Friends of Llyn Society. She likens wind turbines to the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in the 1960s to provide water to Liverpool. "They say that this is our Tryweryn, and there is no sadder sight in my mind in the history of Wales than that small group of people running down that hill after Celyn Valley had been drowned," she said. "And it will be very sad to come to the Llyn in a few years time with the place destroyed and the views ruined." Others say the divisive issue has far-reaching consequences for a usually tight-knit community. "It's already split long-standing friendships and family ties," said Steve Dorling from Llanaelhaearn. "I can't imagine this proposal is any different to others on the peninsula. "It's very sad when kids that went to school together and are now in their forties and fifties no longer speak and that's the case." Taro 9 can be seen on S4C on Tuesday 22 October 2013 at 21:30 BST </body>

      <body>The future of a Denbighshire town's community building remains undecided with campaigners vowing to fight plans that would see it demolished. Corwen Pavilion closed in March 2010 because of health and safety issues. Repairs were estimated at £1.3m and Denbighshire council planned to demolish it and pass the land to a community group to build a new venue. But the demolition was delayed by a court injunction and the council will now discuss the issue next month. Campaigners from Save the Pavilion say the building has played an important part in Welsh culture throughout the 20th Century. It has hosted several concerts and Welsh cultural festivals. The issue has now been placed back on the council agenda after being held up by legal discussions and other issues. Builder Esmor Davies, a member of the Save the Pavilion group, said: "Nine or 10 months has gone and nothing has been done about it. "It's appalling," he said, adding that the delay would only worsen the condition of the building. Demolition was due in April 2011 but it was delayed by a court injunction to give the campaign group time to come up with a viable financial plan for the building. A court hearing was then due to be held in December 2011 but delayed due to a lack of consent from the Charity Commission. The commission has confirmed it has consulted with Denbighshire council regarding demolition. The council in its role of trustee is now due to discuss the issue again at a cabinet meeting at the end of November. It will then be up to the courts early next year to make a decision. A spokesperson for Denbighshire council said if the court was to side with county officials then demolition could take place as soon as possible. Councillor Huw Jones said the issue should have been sorted some time ago. "It's a dangerous building," he said. "It needs to be resolved as soon as possible." He said Denbighshire council was committed to help provide a new building and that the authority "would not walk away". </body>

      <body>Two masked men who terrified a family in their own home during an early morning burglary have been jailed. Mold Crown Court heard they punched one woman in the face, threatened her and two others at knifepoint, and tried to stab a man with a screwdriver. Heroin addicts Colin Maher 31, and Michael Rhodes, 33, from Rhyl, admitted aggravated burglary at the house in Kinmel Bay. Jailing them for eight years, a judge said it was "the stuff of nightmares". "It understandably had a profound effect on the victims," Judge Rhys Rowlands added. "This was truly a terrifying ordeal at the hands of the two of you." Prosecutor David Mainstone told the court how 20-year-old Chantelle Palmer was staying the night with her parents and a 17-year-old girl was also present. In the early hours of 14 May, Miss Palmer was woken by a bang to find two men in the room - one had a hood covering most of his face and the other had a scarf covering his lower face. Both were wearing gloves, and one stood over her bed three feet away. The intruder looked at her and told her to give him money but she said she did not have any. He then held an eight-inch knife to her throat and again demanded money. Mr Mainstone said the burglar punched her, but she bravely hit him back and there was a struggle. While that was going on, a young woman aged 17 in the same bedroom was woken up to find a knife being held to her throat by the other man. "The knife was thrust at her five times before he punched out at her but she pulled her head away and they didn't connect," Mr Mainstone explained. She heard the first knifeman say that "his boys are outside". Miss Palmer's parents heard a commotion and entered the room. Her mother Ananka Palmer saw a man holding a knife at her daughter and then she "felt an arm and something cold across her neck". "She realised a knife was being held across her throat," said Mr Mainstone. "She pushed the man away with both hands, hard, she saw his face was covered and was terrified. She ran out of the room and was shaking." Her husband Carl Palmer grabbed hold of one of the knifemen and they struggled with each other. The intruder then lunged at Mr Palmer with a screwdriver in a stabbing motion but the householder was able to grab the attacker's throat to prevent him being stabbed, the court heard. It was at that stage that Miss Palmer took the screwdriver away from the attacker and her father was able to pull him out of the house. The burglars then fled in a stolen car. The defendants had been drinking before the burglary, their barristers said. Maher received an additional 18 months in jail for possessing heroin with intent to supply. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have attended the opening of a £4.3m pedestrian and cycle bridge across Rhyl harbour. Pont y Ddraig (Dragon's Bridge) provides the final link in 15 miles (24km) of traffic-free cycling across Conwy and Denbighshire. It was named by Rhyl pupil Leon Jones following a schools competition and local children were invited to the opening. Work was delayed earlier this year after cables were stolen from the site. About 200m (656ft) of cable was taken in April from the bridge, which boasts a 45m-high (about 148ft) mast. There are two sections of deck which lift up, with the underside lit up with lights that change from green to red and back. It provides a car-free alternative route to the nearby Blue Bridge, which Sustrans Wales said was very congested and deterred cyclists and walkers from using it. Pont-y-Ddraig now also forms part of a long-distance cycle route across the north Wales coast. Jane Lorimer, director of Sustrans Wales, which partly financed the bridge, said it was one of 10 schemes in Wales which was bringing investment to the local area. "Here in Rhyl the bridge is very much part of a regeneration scheme which is opening up an extension along Rhyl seafront and really putting this area, which is an area of deprivation, into the limelight as a place which is a joy to visit in its own right. "It's unlocked the whole of the harbour areas. There has been additional investment and there will be a visitor centre and public squares. "It's really about creating a destination where people can come and enjoy their time, spend money and get out and about." </body>

      <body>A registered sex offender faces jail after admitting making and possessing indecent images of children. Stephen Meredith, 60, of Four Crosses, Powys, admitted four charges at Welshpool Magistrates' Court. The court heard Meredith underwent a routine check by officers at his home, when he warned them about the contents of his computer. Magistrates told Meredith he faced jail and bailed him conditionally until 14 November for sentencing. Meredith appeared before magistrates on Tuesday and admitted three charges in relation to making indecent images of children. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children. Helen Tench, prosecuting, said that as a registered sex offender, police officers were making a routine check at Meredith's home on 2 May. When they entered the home, he told them he had "something on my computer that's not good", the court heard. Ms Tench said: "Officers sent the computer off for examination and under interview the defendant said he was 'weak-willed' and had nothing else in his life." She said that he had also made obscene internet searches. Ceri Edwards, defending, said Meredith had admitted the charges at the earliest opportunity. </body>

      <body>Urgent work has been carried out to unblock a river in a small village on Gower to prevent it being cut off by rising water. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) removed sand from a channel in Oxwich to restore the flow of water. It comes as 13 flood alerts were issued for rivers across south, west and mid Wales following heavy rain. But NRW has reduced these alerts to six and said the weather is expected to improve over the next 24 hours. A team of engineers has been in Oxwich with a digger to remove the sand, which blew in from the beach and is blocking the flow of water from a channel running through wetlands into the sea. NRW said the stream was backing up and threatening to cut off the village. Nick Edwards, senior reserves manager at NRW, said: "The water that flows down from the marsh has been blocked by the large amount of sand that's been deposited by the high tides recently. "If we didn't do this then in 72 hours, I imagine, the road will be flooded." There were reports of surface water flooding in Dunvant, Swansea, and in Pembroke overnight. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning of further heavy rain for south and west Wales on Tuesday. The B4296 at Dunvant Square near Brynaeron in Swansea was affected by surface water, although Mid and West Wales Fire Service said they had not received any calls from the area. Further west, staff at the Field Studies Centre in Orielton, south of Pembroke, reported seeing flooding near their base, including damage to some cars. A BBC weather presenter said more rainfall through the morning could lead to some localised flooding across south Wales, although the rain was expected to turn to showers in the afternoon. She added there was unlikely to be widespread flooding but surface water flooding could be a problem. Looking ahead, there were concerns that further heavy rainfall on Thursday could raise the risk again, with an early warning in place for south and west Wales. </body>

      <body>Close family, friends and colleagues of the former Football Association of Wales (FAW) president Tegwyn Evans have attended his funeral. Mr Evans, 85, of Welshpool, Powys, died on 8 October, a week after suffering a heart attack. Officials from the FAW attended the funeral service which was held in Welshpool on Monday. A minute's silence was observed for Mr Evans ahead of Wales' World Cup game against Macedonia on 11 October. Mr Evans was described as "passionate" about football, serving as an FAW council member since 1975 and as president from 2003 to 2006. He was also a former mayor of Welshpool, a president of the local football club and a successful businessman. The FAW has said Mr Evans, who was chairman of the Central Wales FA, was a "lifelong stalwart of mid Wales football". Following his death, it said: "During his time at the FAW he was a fine ambassador for the game at home and abroad and made many friends. "Everyone at the FAW salutes his service to football in Wales and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time." Away from football, Mr Evans was heavily involved in his local community and was widely known as "Mr Welshpool". He served on Welshpool Town Council for many years, including a spell as mayor between 1981 and 1983. In 2002, he was awarded the MBE for his services to the town and to Welshpool Football Club. </body>

      <body>Swansea City will once again be without defender Ashley Williams for Thursday's Europa League game against Kuban Krasnodar. Williams has missed Swansea's last five games and has been unable to train because of an ankle injury. The Wales captain is also doubtful for Sunday's home Premier League game against West Ham. "He's still in some pain when he does certain movements," manager Michael Laudrup said. "I already said a couple of weeks ago [that] we are not going to rush it." In Williams's absence Jordi Amat set to continue alongside fellow Spaniard Chico Flores at the heart of the Swans' defence. Laudrup has been impressed with 21-year-old Amat's performances whilst deputising for Williams. "Jordi has confirmed what I already knew and what I expected from him," Laudrup added. "I'm pleased with what I've seen." Left-back Ben Davies will miss the Group A game against the Russian side after being ruled out for up to four weeks with an ankle injury. Winger Pablo Hernandez could return after recovering from a hamstring injury while Jonjo Shelvey and Jose Canas could be recalled in central midfield. </body>

      <body>The search for a second permanent Gypsies and travellers' site in Swansea looks set to be widened across the city after councillors threw out the recommended options. Following a consultation, a report said the new site should be on council-owned land either in Cockett or Llansamlet. But after councillors debated the sites and three other locations that were considered, they voted to start again. Using private land and expanding the existing Llansamlet site are options. "I personally feel we should have been looking at an all-wider Swansea basis for the land," said Labour councillor Robert Francis-Davies, who proposed a new recommendation to ask cabinet to widen the search. "We should adopt a whole Swansea approach and consider all land options." Councillors voted unanimously to back the amendment and it is now up to cabinet to make the final decision. Five possible sites had been under consideration, including two in Gorseinon with the others in Penderry ward, Cockett and Llansamlet. During the meeting, representatives from all five sites and members of the traveller community gave their views on the proposals. The travellers said they wanted a second site in Llansamlet and were open to expanding the current site, but the council was warned that it was unlikely as it is on a flood plain. David Phillips, leader of Labour-led Swansea council, warned in advance of the meeting that issue was going to be "divisive". Swansea council said the Welsh government had insisted all local authorities in Wales look at the needs of Gypsies and travellers "as part of its assessment of accommodation needs". Residents had until 31 March to give their views and a number of campaigns have been launched in opposition to proposals for particular areas. A council spokesperson said: "The latest proposal is that we look at more sites within Swansea to see if there is somewhere suitable for a Gypsy and traveller site. "Our latest housing accommodation needs assessment shows there is a need to develop a second site in the city. "A number of families are residing in Swansea on unlawful and illegal sites and one of the ways to tackle this issue is to ensure they have a legal site for their homes." </body>

      <body>Wales coach Warren Gatland says he will not reprimand scrum-half Mike Phillips after allegations he turned up to a video analysis session at his club Bayonne under the influence of alcohol. Phillips and two team-mates met the Bayonne board on Tuesday to give their side of events. "We will sit down and have a quiet chat about where his head's at," said Gatland. "But there are not going to be any sanctions for him here in this set up." The Wales boss says any club sanction would be a "Bayonne decision". Gatland added: "I can only speak of the last experience that we had with him with the Lions in Australia and he conducted himself extremely well on and off the field. I'm expecting that same sort of attitude when he's involved in this campaign. "Obviously there are slight concerns about making sure this is something that is not repeated." The alleged incident occurred the day after their 37-6 Amlin Challenge Cup win over Grenoble on Thursday, 10 October. Bayonne confirmed a board meeting had taken place but they refused to reveal if any action had been taken against all three players. The statement said: "Having met on Tuesday the players Stephen Brett, Mike Phillips and Dwayne Haare, the board of the Aviron Bayonnais Rugby Pro do not intend to communicate on the recent facts such as reported by the press. "All the components of the club are turned to the next games to begin with the reception of Montpellier on Friday evening at the stadium Jean-Dauger." The 31-year-old British and Irish Lions number nine was suspended by the club in 2012 for off-field misconduct. Phillips was also suspended from the Wales squad in July 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre when he was involved in a confrontation with a doorman. The 77-times capped former Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys player joined Bayonne following the World Cup in the autumn of 2011. He was a key member of the Lions team that beat Australia 2-1 in the Test series last summer, setting up the opening try for Alex Corbisiero in the decisive third Test match victory in Sydney. He has also won two Six Nations Grand Slams with Wales in 2008 and 2012. New Zealanders Wayne Haare and Stephen Brett are the other players who will have to explain their actions to Bayonne board. </body>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to a rugby player who has died suddenly aged 33. Father-of-two Stuart Williams, who played for Pontypridd RFC, was taken ill at work, Craig yr Hesg Quarry, on Monday and later died, the club said. Pontypridd's game against Neath - due to be played at the Gnoll this Saturday - has been postponed until further notice. Mr Williams, from Glyncoch, was married to Vicky and the couple had two young children, Harvey and Megan. Pontypridd RFC finance director Peter Howells described the prop forward as a "fine man on and off the pitch" who appeared well days before he died. The club said Mr Williams had a "real physical presence" in the front row. "I was with him on Saturday night, he wasn't unwell. Devastated is not the word," Mr Howells said. A statement on the club's website described Mr Williams as popular and loyal. "The club is today devastated by the news of Stuart's passing, and all thoughts now turn in deepest sympathy to his young family in their time of grief," it read. 'Devastating news' "Stuart was a popular character around the club, one who gave his all as a hard-grafting prop forward on the pitch, a long serving and loyal member of the squad. Mr Williams represented his local club at youth level before moving to Pontypridd. He graduated through the ranks and joined Rhymney in 2000. Following a spell with Cilfynydd, Mr Williams became a regular member of the Pontypridd senior squad. News of the death came as Wales coach Warren Gatland named his squad for the autumn internationals. "Our thoughts and condolences are with Stuart Williams' family," said Gatland. "On behalf of the Welsh Rugby Union and the national squad our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very, very sad time." </body>

      <body>Cardiff Blues captain Matthew Rees is to undergo testicular surgery. The region say the 32-year-old former Wales skipper, capped 58 times by his country, will have "an enforced spell away from rugby" as a result. The ex-British and Irish Lions hooker, who joined Blues from Scarlets in the summer, will initially miss Friday's RaboDirect Pro12 trip to Ulster. "Cardiff Blues would like to take this opportunity to wish Matthew a speedy recovery," a statement said. "And we look forward to seeing him back in action in the future. "The region will be making no further comment and would ask that the media respect Matthew's privacy at this time." Tonyrefail-born Rees was a late withdrawal from the Blues team ahead of their 19-15 Heineken Cup win over Toulon on Saturday. He played 182 times for the Scarlets after joining the region in the 2004-05 season and was famously part of the all-Welsh front row, along with props Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones, for the three Lions Tests against South Africa in June 2009. Rees previously played for Treorchy, Pontypridd and the now defunct Celtic Warriors and became Wales' 128th captain when given the role against Australia in November 2010. But he struggled to hold down a first-team place at Parc y Scarlets after missing out on Wales' World Cup campaign in 2011 through injury and departed for Cardiff at the end of last season. </body>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined £140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <title>Confusion over HS2 cash for Wales</title>
      <description>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project.</description>

      <body>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project. Finance Minister Jane Hutt has told AMs there was a £35m budget increase coming in 2015-16 as a result of £832m UK expenditure on HS2. But the UK Treasury has categorically denied this, saying that HS2 spending is not being passed on. Ms Hutt is now facing calls for an urgent clarification amid claims she may have misled AMs. The issue of whether Wales should receive additional funding from the HS2 rail project has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. It would have meant around £35m extra for Wales in 2015-16 and set a precedent for potentially billions more over the lifetime of the project. But the Treasury said the Welsh government's claim was mistaken - and HS2 was excluded from what is known as "Barnett consequentials". Under that process, if extra money is spent on projects in England in services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, Wales receives a slice of extra money too. That process would normally include transport spending - but not in the case of HS2, according to Treasury officials. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: "At the spending round, Wales received Barnett consequentials in the normal way; this excluded funding for HS2. "The government is clear HS2 will be a vital part of our national infrastructure, boosting regional growth across the country and providing vital capacity the UK needs to compete in the global race. "As with any government spending Barnett consequentials will be considered at the next spending review." A spokesperson for the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: "It is crucial that the finance minister clarifies this issue as soon as possible because if what the Treasury says is true, the finance minister has misled the finance committee. "Assembly members expect the information provided to them by the Welsh Government to be accurate and correct." Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <description>The first minister queries a UK government plan to tackle so-called 'health tourism' with a levy on visitors' visas.</description>

      <body>A plan to impose a levy on UK visitors' visas to pay for health services has not been properly thought through, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said. The UK government hopes to recover around a quarter of the £2bn spent on healthcare for overseas visitors and deter so-called "health tourism". Mr Jones told AMs there was no plans to redistribute any of the funds raised to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. He said UK ministers must "think again" as health was a devolved service. The UK government believes savings would come from the levy on the visas of non-European temporary residents, by deterring "health tourism" and by recovering money owed by other countries for NHS treatment their nationals had received. The proposals followed the publication of an independent report commissioned by the Department of Health in London. Speaking during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Mr Jones said he had a "curious" conversation with UK government officials at last week's Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in Downing Street, a meeting which involves devolved administrations and UK ministers. He said officials had confirmed that the levy was being imposed to pay for health services but they had told him Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would not get the usual share they receive for areas of government that were devolved. "So it seems this money is going to be collected and used entirely for the health service in England," he said. "It was clear to me they hadn't thought this through in any way, certainly the first minister of Northern Ireland was equally as astounded as I was by the comment." "We in Wales will find ourselves in the situation where we will not receive a share of the money that is specifically collected for the purpose of the delivery of a devolved service. "They need to think again," Mr Jones added. </body>

      <title>Welsh firms lose out on policy bids</title>
      <description>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged.</description>

      <body>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged. While most tenders for work are put out to everyone, ministers in Cardiff have adopted a UK government process to evaluate certain schemes. Only one company from Wales is registered to bid. The Welsh government said the process provided value for money. Only one company from Wales is registered with the department responsible in London, which means the others have been unable to bid for more than £800,000 worth of contracts, including a review of the Welsh government's flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme. Another research project involved assessing a Welsh government initiative to increase the amount of goods and services public bodies bought from Welsh companies. The Welsh government says between 80% and 90% of its tenders are open to all. A spokesperson said: "We are committed to encouraging Welsh businesses and higher education institutions to benefit from public sector contracts. We purchase the majority of our research via open tender or via our own procurement framework which does include a number of Welsh businesses. "We occasionally make use of the procurement framework operated by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) which provides good value for money." It said several Welsh organisations had been brought in as sub-contractors. Organisations such as the consultancies, Iaith and Oldbell 3, and the Cardiff Business School have been involved in some projects. The information emerged following freedom of information requests by Plaid Cymru. The party accuses the Welsh government of failing to "practise what it preaches" by allowing some businesses to be "cut out" of some contracts. North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd dismissed the claim that much of the work was sub-contracted back to Wales. "They take their top slice, they pocket that and they sub-contract Welsh companies to actually deliver large parts of the work , but at a fraction of the cost," he said. "So the key issue here is that the Welsh economy is in effect a leaking bucket. "There's a hole in the Welsh economy with all this potential money for Welsh businesses flowing out of Wales. We need to plug that leak." Iestyn Davies, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Cymru, said: "The government spends significant money through small businesses and large companies and it's important that the value is felt in the communities where those businesses are based. "When you spend money outside of Wales, that money's lost to Wales. "It's a very simple equation. "So good public sector procurement can leave a long-lasting value and legacy within communities. It doesn't matter how big the contract is, it can still have a real impact on a small local business." </body>

      <description>Racing Metro centre Jamie Roberts targets a Six Nations return after an ankle injury rules him out of Wales' autumn Tests.</description>

      <body>Centre Jamie Roberts says his goal is to be selected for the Six Nations after injury saw him miss out on the Wales squad for the autumn Test series. Roberts, 26, damaged his ankle in Racing Metro's 19-16 defeat of Perpignan in the Top 14 clash in Paris in September. He was not named in Warren Gatland's Wales squad for the Autumn Test series on Tuesday. "That [the Six Nations] has to be my goal now," said Roberts. "Missing out on selection means it will be hard to watch but ultimately... it will drive me to be a better player. "If those guys do well in the autumn, that will drive me to train harder to get selected for the Six Nations squad." Gatland named six centres - Jon Davies (Scarlets), Ashley Beck (Ospreys), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Owen Williams (Cardiff Blues), James Hook (Perpignan) - in his squad. In-form Williams is tipped to replace Roberts in the Wales midfield alongside his Scarlets team-mate Davies. Roberts is philosophical about missing out on Wales squad selection for the first time since a wrist injury ruled him out of the autumn series in 2010. "I am injured and I will miss out and that is professional sport," said Roberts. "They have picked five centres and I am very confident those guys can do a sterling job "As of Friday, I will be six weeks post operation and I am probably another four or five weeks away from playing. "I am likely to be fit by the end of November, the doctors tell me. "I just have to keep working hard, keep rehabbing well and keep being really diligent with my rehab. "I hope to get back on the field as soon as possible. All I can do is try to get myself as fit as I can. "If I am needed for international selection, so be it, but I just have to get my head down and train hard and get back fit and see where I am in mid- November." Roberts, a member of the victories British and Irish Lions party who earned a series win in Australia earlier this year, had only played three games for Racing before being injured. He scored a try in the Lions' 41-16 third Test victory over Australia in Sydney to clinch a first Test series win for 16 years. But Roberts, who qualified as a doctor before moving to Paris from Cardiff Blues in July, acknowledges Wales has some real depth with a batch of new young centres establishing themselves with the regions. "Scott has been playing very well with the Scarlets, Jonathan has been playing well since coming back from the Lions tour," said Roberts. "Cory and Owen are two young centres at the Blues who have been knocking on the door for quite a while. "With their opening games of the season with the Blues, they attributes that will thrive on the international stage. "Then there is Ashley Beck, who has played well for the Ospreys and we all know what a talent he is." </body>

      <body>Wales' four rugby regions are backing Anglo-French plans for a new European competition in a further threat to the future of the Heineken Cup. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons claim the revamped tournament offers "significant advantages". The Welsh Rugby Union opposes the new European competition. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis has said it would be a "crazy concept" to get rid of the Heineken Cup. In a statement, Regional Rugby Wales, which represents the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup competitions. "Whilst there remain elements of detail to be confirmed, it is now clear that there are a number of significant advantages to the new competitions in equality of governance, format, qualification and distribution across the individual participating clubs," it read. "Consequently, RRW looks forward to working with the WRU to support their efforts and positive engagement in striving to ensure our teams are involved in strong, valuable European clubs competitions in time for next season." The Welsh, Scottish and Irish Rugby Unions are refusing to let their clubs participate in any European competition if it does not have the "full approval" of the International Rugby Board (IRB). The IRB has previously indicated to the BBC it could support a new-look competition if it was approved by the English and French unions. Europe's top teams currently compete in the Heineken Cup or second-tier Amlin Challenge Cup. England's Aviva Premiership clubs and their French Top 14 counterparts announced in June 2012 their intention to leave the competition organised by European Rugby Cup Ltd (ERC). ERC is staging a meeting for stakeholders in Dublin on Wednesday, but representatives of the English and French clubs are expected to boycott the gathering. English and French clubs believe ERC has not made the most of commercial opportunities and that qualification for Europe is skewed in favour of Celtic and Italian teams. They also believe that tournament funds have not been fairly distributed. Their contention that Pro12 teams have an unfair advantage when it comes to qualifying for European places has caused simmering resentment for several seasons. At least three Wales teams automatically enter Europe's top tier no matter where they finish in the Pro12, while at least three of Ireland's four teams are also guaranteed entry. Scotland and Italy both get two spots. </body>

      <body>New Glamorgan coach Toby Radford says Robert Croft and Steve Watkin have key roles to play under his leadership. Radford takes over as head coach next month - a job for which Watkin and Croft both applied. The former England players are currently employed as bowling coaches at the county, and Caerphilly-born Radford does not see that changing. "I see them playing a major role with the coaching staff as we go forward," he said. Radford, 41, believes their experience as former Test match bowlers knits well with his specialist knowledge of batting. Croft took 1,175 first class wickets during his playing carer with Glamorgan, with Watkin pitching in with 902. Former Middlesex and Sussex batsman Radford joins Glamorgan from the West Indies, where he was assistant coach and batting coach. "They are mainly bowling specialists but I see them working very tightly with me," he said of Croft and Watkin. "I'd like to see a very tight unit with a clear definition of roles all working to the same ends. "I think this winter is when we'll be doing a lot of our work and not just working with our own players but putting plan in place for all the teams we'll come up against in different competitions next year." Radford also believes Glamorgan should be playing in the first division of the county championship instead of languishing near the bottom of division two. "For a side that pretty much represents the whole of Wales has a fantastic ground and a big support base you'd like to think that club would be a first division club," he said. "In one-day cricket [the team were] not too bad, particularly in the 40-over form and got to a one day final at Lord's. "But in championship cricket bottom-but-one in the second division in the four day game. "I think there's a lot of good things there and in many ways now it's time to improve the play in the championship and I'd love to see the side make it into the first division." Improving the form of the county's Welsh-produced players to match that of their key overseas signings will be key to that improvement. Radford believes the team relied too heavily on Australian pace bowler Michael Hogan, Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin and Australian-born but England qualified all-rounder Jim Allenby. "They are a big core to the team," said Radford, while conceding one of his challenges was to bring the other players up their standards. "I'd love to see some of these Welsh lads getting their batting averages up from the mid-20s into the high 30s or early 40s," he added. "There may be little tweaks we can to technically with some of these guys that can make that difference." </body>

Under Universal Credit - the scheme to overhaul the benefits system - benefits will be paid to tenants rather than landlords. But figures from a pilot project in Torfaen show tenants are going into arrears because they are struggling to cope with the changes.

      <description>Row over future of castle grounds to be settled</description>

      <body>A row over the future of the grounds of an 11th Century castle is due to be settled at a public hearing. Campaigners want to keep Haverfordwest castle grounds open to the public by securing village green status. That would stop the site being used for private redevelopment, such as recent interest in setting up a hotel. Haverfordwest Town Council is behind the application but Pembrokeshire County Council said the plan was flawed and wants to sell off the land. "We feel it is in the best interests of our town to retain its heritage by having the castle left open for public use," said Haverfordwest town councillor Peter Lewis. "It's just one of these places where people feel they should be able to walk at any time. "Haverfordwest castle is what the town has been built around - it is fundamental, it is our iconic building, it pervades everything. "If you look at all of our sports clubs, they carry the castle motif. Everyone sees that as the central feature of our town." The site is owned by Pembrokeshire council and only a few of the original stone walls remain of the 11th Century castle. For decades the public has enjoyed open access. The town museum is housed there and the site is used by people to walk their dogs, eat lunch in fine weather and watch occasional events on the grass. In 2010, Pembrokeshire council announced that it was putting part of the castle site - an old Victorian prison building which for years had been home to the county records office - up for sale. Last year, an architect and developer showed an interest in turning it into an eight to 16-bedroom boutique hotel and restaurant, but it proved controversial. Some time later the developer walked away. The town council decided then that the only way to protect the site for good was to apply for village green status. It has also put in an offer to buy the Victorian prison building for £50,000. Pembrokeshire council said the castle grounds had been declared a public open space in 2009 and the town council had the chance to challenge it but failed to do so. It argues the standing as a public open space means public events in the castle grounds can be organised and managed effectively with the granting of the appropriate licences. Deputy leader Huw George said village green status would change forever what could be done with the site. "It will make it very difficult to regulate who uses it and when they use it and that causes us a great concern," he said. "Our greatest concern is the objection [against development] they've put in, which is by nature flawed. "The objection I believe should've come in 2009 when it was declared a public open space. We're now in 2013, which seems to me a little bit flawed." He added: "By turning it into a village green we curtail many options which may harm the development economically and with tourism in the future, and I think Haverfordwest deserves to have all opportunities left open." Both sides are being represented by a solicitor, and the public hearing will be presided over by the Planning Inspectorate. The hearing, which starts on Wednesday, has been described by the county council as an "unnecessary application" and said it was costing a "great deal of public money at a time when every penny counts". But Mr Lewis said the action was necessary. "It's going to cost us well over £10,000 and it's going to cost the county council more than that to defend it but we feel we've got no choice," he said. </body>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>Jones backs halting winter surgery</title>
      <description>Plan to cope with NHS winter pressure backed by first minister</description>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <title>‘Most distant galaxy’ discovered</title>
      <description>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet.</description>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago. Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645809_c0109978-emerald_ash_borer_on_a_leaf-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <title>First venomous crustacean found</title>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Bristol are in line for up to £33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The £40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed £16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend £200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said the government had wasted the past three years. The opposition said only one project - the £700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date while, in total, work had only begun on one in five of infrastructure projects. "There's lots more that could be done but they just don't seem to have their heart in it," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. "The energy isn't there and there's a question of competence now about whether they can deliver on some of these infrastructure promises that they're making." Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. Business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. "Despite the scale of the UK Guarantee Scheme, only around a third of firms are aware of it, so this announcement will help raise awareness to other projects struggling to find finance," said the CBI's Rhian Kelly. "The government now needs to push more of these pre-qualification projects through the approval stage so that they can get off the drawing board." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness.

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <description>New global threats from pests and diseases could spell disaster for British forests, experts warn.</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs."

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>Canine virus threatens Siberian tiger</title>
      <description>Dog virus is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24535799</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70502000/jpg/_70502776_z9340701-siberian_tiger_panthera_tigris_altaica_-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Union may back Ineos survival plan</title>
      <description>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos.</description>

      <body>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos. About half the workforce at the complex had rejected new terms and conditions proposed by Ineos, prompting the firm to announce the plant's closure. Subject to agreement by the workforce, Unite may now accept the changes in a "last-ditch effort" to keep it open. The union is to present its proposals to Ineos at a meeting on Thursday. It remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that the company would reverse its decision. However, the company had said while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Previously, Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond spoke again to management and unions to try and seek further resolution. He also convened an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss the on-going situation. Afterwards he said there was still room for negotiation between both parties, particularly since Unite had put forward fresh proposals to the company. Mr Salmond said: "We should give time for the proper consideration of this offer, especially given that we know an agreement between both sides was very close last week, and the prize is a viable future for Grangemouth. "However, given that the current position is the one we always feared possible given the stalemate between the sides, if an agreement between Ineos and Unite is not possible then we will continue to pursue our contingency options of finding a buyer for the site." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - met in London to discuss this issue. Mr Carmichael told BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme that Mr Davey had a 40-minute "positive" talk with Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. </body>

      <title>Merkel concern at 'US phone spying'</title>
      <description>German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls President Barack Obama after receiving information the US may have spied on her mobile phone.</description>

      <body>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called US President Barack Obama after receiving information that the US may have spied on her mobile phone. A spokesman for Mrs Merkel said the German leader "views such practices... as completely unacceptable". Mrs Merkel called on US officials to clarify the extent of their surveillance in Germany. The White House said President Obama had told Chancellor Merkel the US was not snooping on her communications. "The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday. The US has been on the receiving end of anger from allies over spying allegations based on material said to originate from fugitive American leaker Edward Snowden. Mr Carney told reporters that Washington was examining concerns from Germany as well as France and other American allies over US intelligence practices. But the spokesman did not address whether Mrs Merkel's phone had been monitored in the past. Berlin demanded "an immediate and comprehensive explanation" from Washington about what it said "would be a serious breach of trust". In a statement it said: "Among close friends and partners, as the Federal Republic of Germany and the US have been for decades, there should be no such monitoring of the communications of a head of government." The statement also said that Mrs Merkel had told Mr Obama: "Such practices must be prevented immediately." The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says because the statement was issued after the phone call, there were indications that Mrs Merkel had not been reassured. He says the issue of state monitoring of phone calls is a real one in Germany - Angela Merkel grew up in East Germany, where phone tapping was pervasive. President Obama had assured Chancellor Merkel when he visited in June that German citizens were not being spied upon and our correspondent says she was criticised then by political opponents for not being more sceptical. The German government would not elaborate on how it received the tip about the alleged US spying. But news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published stories based on material from Edward Snowden, said the information had come from its investigations. Mrs Merkel's call comes a day after US intelligence chief James Clapper denied reports that American spies had recorded data from 70 million phone calls in France in a single 30-day period. He said a report in Le Monde newspaper had contained "misleading information". A number of US allies have expressed anger over the Snowden-based spying allegations. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cancelled a visit to the US this month in protest at alleged electronic espionage by the NSA against her country, including of communications at her office. In a speech at the United Nations, she rejected arguments put forward by the US that the interception of information was aimed at protecting nations against terrorism, drugs trafficking and other organised crime. The Mexican government has called the alleged spying on the emails of two presidents, Enrique Pena Nieto - the incumbent - and Felipe Calderon, as "unacceptable". US officials have begun a review of American intelligence gathering amid the international outcry. </body>

      <title>Private christening for baby prince</title>
      <description>The christening of Prince George, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, has taken place in London.</description>

      <body>The christening of Prince George has taken place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London. The prince, third in line to the throne, was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The christening was private, with only senior royals, four members of the Middleton family, the seven godparents and their spouses among the 22 guests. Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was born in London on 22 July. The duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. Attending a reception at Buckingham Palace after the event, the Queen told guests how much she had enjoyed the ceremony. "It was very nice though, wasn't it?" she told the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, at the event for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. The godparents, announced earlier, are Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall. Mrs Tindall, wife of former England rugby player Mike Tindall, is Prince William's cousin, while the other six godparents are all friends of the royal couple. Prince George was baptised in a replica of the lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The duke and duchess chose two hymns, two lessons and two anthems for the christening. The hymns were Breathe on Me, Breath of God and Be Thou My Vision. Lessons from St Luke and St John were read by Pippa Middleton and Prince Harry, and the anthems were Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand and the Lord Bless You and Keep You. The anthems were sung by the Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, which performed at the royal couple's wedding. The ceremony took about 45 minutes. After the ceremony, celebrity photographer Jason Bell was expected to take a picture of the Queen and princes Charles, William and George together. This will echo a 1894 picture from the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother - George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. The picture is expected to be released on Thursday. </body>

      <title>US health chief becomes new NHS boss</title>
      <description>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service.</description>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there is growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - £211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of £189,900 in the first year. Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accuse David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Dublin Roma girl returned to family</title>
      <description>DNA tests prove that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have proved that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter. The family said they were "delighted" that their daughter had come home. They also said they would be taking legal advice, and that serious questions have arisen over the procedures used in the case. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl had been removed by police from her Tallaght home and taken into temporary care. The family have supported calls from human rights group Pavee Point for an independent inquiry into the investigation. In a statement issued through their solicitor the family said: "Her removal has been a cause of huge upset to her parents, her brothers and sisters, and the young girl herself. "They now intend to concentrate on looking after their family and, in particular, in trying to reassure their daughter that she will be left in their care. "Our clients also wish to say they do not believe that what has happened to their family over the few days should ever have happened. "They do not accept that this was any proper or sufficient basis to take their daughter away from them. "They believe that there are very serious questions arising about the procedures used in this case but are going to wait for things to settle down and consider their position and that of their daughter in light of recent events and will be taking legal advice in respect of this." A 21-year-old sister of the child, who can not be identified for legal reasons, said their mother had not eaten for three days because she was so distraught. "Everyone was very sad," she said. The sister added she hoped no other family would have to go through a similar ordeal. Meanwhile, a two-year-old boy from a Roma family who was briefly taken into care in County Westmeath has been reunited with his parents. The boy was taken from his family on Tuesday in Athlone and returned a day later. Alan Shatter, the Irish minister for justice, said he will be asking the Garda (Police) Commissioner for a report on the two cases. A Garda statement said: "Protecting vulnerable children is of paramount importance to An Garda Síochána and we continue to work in partnership with the HSE (Health Service Executive) and other agencies to ensure children's safety. "An Garda Síochána want to assure the community that we take extremely serious all reports received from members of the public concerning child welfare issues." The Irish police action took place against the background of international interest in the case of a blonde-haired child being taken from a Roma family in Greece last week. Greek police are investigating whether the girl had been abducted. </body>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". No action was taken against Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police, and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, following an internal review by the forces concerned into their conduct. But the head of West Mercia Police told the Commons Home Affairs Committee the handling of the affair had been "clumsy" and the report and its recommendations should be independently reviewed. However, the chief constables of Warwickshire and the West Midlands said they did not feel the same because they believed the original decisions had been properly reached. Sgt Jones, Insp MacKaill and Det Sgt Hinton's meeting with Mr Mitchell took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where the Tory MP was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he had used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis, a member of the committee, accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Mr Vaz said their answers had been "most unsatisfactory" and he would be calling their media adviser, John Gaunt, to answer questions about his role in the affair. Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. But Chief Constable David Shaw, head of West Mercia Police, said he now believed the report should be independently reviewed, suggesting the whole episode had been "unedifying" and had damaged public confidence in the police. He also said he had written to Mr Mitchell to offer him a "profound and unreserved" apology for what had happened. Also giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording of the meeting indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked". The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Mr Mitchell's friends have accused them of pursuing a political agenda and called for root-and-branch changes to guarantee police accountability. Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <title>British links to al-Shabab revealed</title>
      <description>A list of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Somali militants al-Shabab - and related organisations - is compiled by the BBC.</description>

      <body>The names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to al-Shabab - and related organisations - have been established by the BBC. Most of those on the list travelled to Somalia to fight or attempted to do so. Somali-based militants al-Shabab carried out the deadly attack on the Westgate mall in neighbouring Kenya. Lawyers for the family of one British recruit known to have died in Somalia are investigating whether he was killed in a raid involving western military. Al-Shabab is fighting to impose a brutal version of Islamic law on the country and the group is linked to al-Qaeda. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad, and further first-hand research and accounts. It is not a complete list of people from the UK who are suspected of having gone to fight because it is impossible to establish or estimate with any certainty how many Westerners have taken up arms in Somalia. The research found that security chiefs believe at least 32 of the identifiable individuals went to fight. A further seven were named in British court cases as having attempted to enter Somalia, but their plans were discovered and disrupted. Others have been accused or convicted of raising money for al-Shabab, or facilitating the travel of others. Seven people on the list returned to the UK - but the fate of most of the others is completely unknown. Four of the men on the list are known to be dead, including men who featured on a video released by the group a week ago. The video included a message from a young man named as "Talha", who asked Muslims in Tower Hamlets - a borough in east London - to join the jihad in Somalia. Talha, whose real name was Taufail Ahmed, died in Somalia in November 2012. The Foreign Office said it had confirmed the death to his family, who are of Bangladeshi origin. He grew up in Stepney Green in east London. The BBC has tracked down people who knew him at school. They say he fell into a life of gang crime before leaving that world behind in favour of an extreme interpretation of Islam, before disappearing from the UK. "For British Muslims he's doing a disservice," said one former schoolmate. "For Muslims around the world, he is doing a disservice." In the al-Shabab video, the narrator says that "Talha" died after an attack involving American and British forces. The government has not commented on that claim but his family has asked the legal charity Reprieve to investigate. "The family were notified by British police officers. The FCO [Foreign Office] have knowledge of the incident and have told us that Taufail Ahmed received a Muslim burial," said Kat Craig from Reprieve. "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Vatican suspends 'bishop of bling'</title>
      <description>The Vatican suspends a German bishop dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over alleged lavish spending, including a $42m renovation of his home.</description>

      <body>The Vatican has suspended a senior German Church leader dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over his alleged lavish spending. Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is accused of spending more than 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on renovating his official residence. The Vatican said it deemed "appropriate... a period of leave from the diocese" for the bishop. The suspension comes two days after he met the Pope to discuss the matter. "A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties", a Vatican statement said. It said a Church commission would rule on the matter, but did not say where Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would go or what he would do while the inquiry was held. The head of Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, Alois Glueck, welcomed the Vatican's decision. He said: "Pope Francis's decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation has become an increasing burden for the faithful there, and in all of Germany, over recent weeks." Bishop Tebartz-van Elst - and his spending habits - had become infamous in Germany, where many people pay Church tax to the state. The tax raised 5.2bn euros for Catholics and 4.6bn euros for Protestants in 2012. Calls were made for the bishop to resign after he was accused of lying under oath about his spending. He was criticised for a first-class flight to India to visit the poor. But his official residence is at the heart of the criticism, after renovations were originally costed at 5.5m euros. German media are reporting that the residence was fitted with a bath that cost 15,000 euros, a conference table for 25,000 euros and a private chapel that cost 2.9m euros. The story has attracted heavy coverage and has stoked controversy among Catholics. It was in Germany that Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. The BBC's Alan Johnston, in Rome, says all this was bound to play badly with the new Pope, who has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of senior clerics whose lifestyles seem a little too lavish. Pope Francis has also signalled his intention to clean up the Vatican's finances, appointing a commission to advise him on reforms. There is no surprise in Rome that the Vatican has ordered the bishop's suspension from his duties while the spending row is investigated, our correspondent adds. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the daughter of a Protestant pastor, said that she had expressed "hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church". In his absence, the bishop's diocese will be administered by Limburg's vicar general, Wolfgang Roesch. </body>

      <title>‘Most distant galaxy’ discovered</title>
      <description>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet.</description>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago. Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <body>Children's author Malorie Blackman has been named at the top of a list of the UK's most influential black figures. Blackman, who is the current Children's Laureate, topped publishing company Powerful Media's annual Powerlist. The author was followed in the top five by merchant banker Ken Olisa, barrister Matthew Ryder, athlete Mo Farah and media agency boss Karen Blackett. Blackman said: "Highlighting so many black people in such diverse different spheres is such an inspiring thing." She continued: "It challenges stereotypes and shows that many people are achieving great things. It's a fantastic showcase of the amazing success stories that often go unreported." Blackman began her career as a computer programmer and TV scriptwriter before being spurred to write her first book because of a dearth of children's stories featuring black characters. She has now written more than 60 books for children and teenagers, including Noughts and Crosses, Pig-Heart Boy, Hacker and Cloud-Busting. She was made Children's Laureate in June. At number two on the list, Ken Olisa runs merchant bank Restoration Partners and is a non-executive director at Thomson Reuters. A library at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, was recently named after Olisa after he made a £2m donation. The names were chosen by a five-person panel headed by management consultant Vivian Hunt and including Thomson Reuters executive Olakunle Babarinde. The Powerlist is sponsored by Thomson Reuters and Lloyds Bank. A spokesman for the Powerlist said the panel was independent and the rankings decided on merit. </body>

      <body>A cameraman had an unexpected regular visitor while filming seals in Orkney for the BBC's The Great British Year television programme. Raymond Besant was filming a grey seal colony from a hide, but discovered it damaged. To his surprise, he found one of the seal pups hiding inside - and it kept returning. Mr Besant said: "He did have the good grace to get out when he saw me approaching." He explained: "I was filming over a period of three weeks and had a hide positioned at the top of the shore to avoid disturbing the seals too much. "But after two weeks of filming I noticed one morning that the hide looked damaged. "I thought it was just the bad weather but when I opened the back of the hide I found a young seal sleeping inside it." He went on: "The dilemma was how to get him out of the hide, I needed to get on with filming and I didn't want to get bitten. "I gently shook the hide and eventually he shuffled out. He had wrecked the hide, he was still moulting so there was fur everywhere and it smelled pretty bad, like wet dog. "I put some driftwood and things that were lying on the shore across the entrance to stop him coming in again as he had bent the hide poles over so far I couldn't close the entrance properly." "When I came down the next morning I was surprised to see his head poking out again. The wood was no barrier, he just bounced over the top of it. "So I took the driftwood away and decided that if he was going to go in I couldn't stop him. So for a week I arrived each morning to find him there." The wildlife cameraman added: "He was just a clever seal that had found somewhere warm and dry to stay." The footage appears in the autumn programme of The Great British Year which airs on BBC1 at 21:00 on Wednesday and is also available on the iPlayer. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments over whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevin Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <title>PM to review fixed odds machines</title>
      <description>David Cameron promises to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from High Street betting shops.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to £100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at £100 and the maximum payout at £500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>
      <date>1382520781</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70652000/jpg/_70652651_fb.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645809_c0109978-emerald_ash_borer_on_a_leaf-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>
      <description>In the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24609525</url>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Many might want to do something about urban foxes in their area. There's an increasingly popular and humane way to outwit them.</description>

      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad</title>
      <description>Manchester United move a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad.</description>

      <body>Manchester United moved a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad. Inigo Martinez's second-minute own goal - which also owed much to superb work by Wayne Rooney - ensured United maintained their unbeaten record in the competition this season. United manager David Moyes will have made three points his sole objective after the disappointing 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton on Saturday and in a week when their European campaign has been reduced to a sideshow by revelations in former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's new autobiography. And on the night when United gave a trial to Old Trafford's new 'singing section',  they at least had something to celebrate - unlike the 6,000 colourful visiting fans who followed Sociedad. The La Liga side made United work hard for the win but it was one they fully deserved despite some anxious moments, particularly when Antoine Griezmann hit the post with a first-half free-kick. Rooney was once again United's main source of danger as he continued the outstanding form he has shown this season. If there are any complaints from Moyes, they will have centre on his side's inability to finish the game off earlier - as well as some questionable defending that offered Sociedad hope. And at least Moyes was finally able to move the agenda away from his predecessor Ferguson, who has claimed the headlines this week and overshadowed this important Champions League game as he raked over his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford. Once again, this was not a fluent United performance but the result will give them added confidence ahead the return meeting away to Sociedad in a fortnight. Moyes decided against risking striker Robin van Persie, who has been suffering with toe and groin injuries - but Rooney's irresistible form meant the Netherlands international was not missed early on as United were ahead inside two minutes. Rooney demonstrated perfect technique and speed of thought to evade three defenders in the area, only to curl a shot against the post with keeper Claudio Bravo beaten. As Sociedad appeared to have survived, Martinez sliced the rebound hopelessly into his own net. Sociedad had a valid claim for Javier Hernandez being offside as Martinez did his unwitting work but Dutch referee Bas Nijhuis and his officials were unmoved by the complaints. Rooney was at the heart of everything early on and almost added a second after 12 minutes - but Bravo was equal to his volley from Rafael's cross. From hesitant early beginnings, Sociedad grew in confidence into the game and were desperately unlucky not to equalise before half-time. David De Gea had already saved athletically from Haris Seferovic but he could do nothing to stop Griezmann's free-kick and was relieved as it bounced away off the woodwork. Sociedad continued to improve after the break but United were creating chances as Phil Jones saw his header blocked by Bravo and Antonio Valencia's low, angled shot struck the post. Fortunately for United, Sociedad had lost the impetus they gather in the early moments of the second half and did not make United pay for those missed chances. Manchester United boss David Moyes: "Yes [I was frustrated] because we had it on Saturday in a Premier League game when we lost a late goal. If we had scored five or six today it wouldn't would have looked out of place. "I'm concerned we gave away couple of free kicks on the edge of the box. But Wayne Rooney was absolutely terrific tonight, I was shouting at him in the last five minutes though. "We just want a top player like Wayne to play well. I said from day one that his training was great. I think England have seen that. But we need to see it all the time." </body>

      <description>Sergio Aguero scores twice as Manchester City come from behind to win 2-1 away to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.</description>

      <body>Sergio Aguero scored twice as Manchester City came from behind to beat CSKA Moscow and reignite their Champions League Group D campaign. Manuel Pellegrini had complained about the pitch at the Khimki Arena, and the City boss must have feared the worst when Zoran Tosic put the hosts ahead. The former Manchester United player lobbed Joe Hart before Aguero levelled after David Silva's cross. Aguero capped a gutsy City display by heading home Alvaro Negredo's cross. It was far from comfortable for Pellegrini and his players, who were forced to endure some anxious moments against the Russian champions to record their second away win of the group stage. Indeed City goalkeeper Hart had to produce a fine stop with an outstretched leg to deny Japan international Keisuke Honda an equaliser deep into stoppage time. But victory over CSKA in the return game at the Etihad Stadium on 5 November ought to allow City to start planning for the knockout stages for the first time. After their flat performance against Bayern Munich three weeks ago, City now have six points from three games, three more than the Russians. CSKA painted the pitch green in some areas after Pellegrini said it was "unbelievable" Uefa passed it fit for use following heavy rain. But the Chilean's pre-match criticism of the surface was quickly brushed aside as City peppered the hosts' goal. Aguero, Yaya Toure, who said after the game he had been subjected to racist chanting, and Negredo all had chances before poor defending in the 32nd minute allowed Tosic to produce a moment of quality that was all too rare during his stint at Old Trafford between January 2009 and June 2010.  The 26-year-old Serbia international found the net with a delicate lob after Honda won an aerial duel with Javi Garcia. Yet the character lacking from Pellegrini's side in the 3-1 home defeat by Bayern last month was in ample supply as Aguero spearheaded the turnaround. Within two minutes the visitors were level, the Argentina forward getting ahead of marker Sergei Ignashevich to turn Silva's low cross home from close range. And three minutes before the interval, Aguero put City in front with his ninth goal of the season, a brave header following a delightful cross from the outside of Negredo's boot. CSKA pushed forward in search of an equaliser after half-time, Tosic proving a serious threat as City lived dangerously. Substitute Ahmed Musa thought he had equalised in the 80th minute with a terrific 20-yard strike but his effort was ruled out as Pontus Wernbloom fouled Toure. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "I'm very happy. The result is very important for the team. The whole team concentrated with intensity on a difficult pitch. "Aguero and Silva are both top players and every match they show how they can play football. We are not in the next round but this is very important for us." </body>

      <title>Break vital for Robshaw - Lancaster</title>
      <description>Stuart Lancaster says Chris Robshaw was right to take a summer break even though he could have lost the England captaincy.</description>

      <body>Stuart Lancaster says Chris Robshaw was right to step away from rugby over the summer even though it threatened to cost him the England captaincy. Robshaw opted to rest rather than tour Argentina with Lancaster's squad. But he has been reinstated as skipper for the autumn internationals against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand after holding off Tom Wood's claims. Head coach Lancaster said: "It was the right thing to do. The pressures of captaining club and country are big." He added: "When I looked at him and spoke to him at the end of last season, while he was willing to go on tour, I felt a physical and mental break was important for him. And he's come back refreshed, to take on the role again. "We spoke about the end of the season, to give him some areas to develop. One was his foot speed over the floor, and his ability to change his pace. "He's worked on those. Harlequins have done a good job and he looks in great shape. To have a big back row in the modern game is handy, so he's got physicality as well, but I think he's a bit more dynamic as well." Robshaw had been omitted from the British and Ireland Lions squad that secured a historic series win down under, and then had to watch as Wood captained England to win in their own series in Argentina. But Lancaster feels that process has left him in a better position as Australia come to town. The coach said: "It obviously hurt him. But it happened at a time when he had the opportunity to get away from rugby. To be able to get abroad, get some sun on his back, reflect on what he'd done over the last 12 months… I think he came back having put it to bed and moved on. "He's had to fight to get in the England side, and he knows nothing will be taken for granted. And he's had disappointments in the past, and fought back from them." Lancaster will finalise his team for Australia's visit to Twickenham on 2 November after training next Tuesday, although it seems certain that Billy Vunipola will win a first start at eight. The coach was also fulsome in his praise for Northampton scrum-half Lee Dickson, which suggests Ben Youngs might not be guaranteed the starting role at nine. "Everyone has to be playing at the top of their game to get picked," he said. "We could have lads who have been away on Lions tours wondering now if they're going to get picked." Neither was Robshaw given any assurances about the captaincy when he opted to miss the summer tour. But Lancaster made it clear that, once he came through the weekend's games unscathed, the Harlequins flanker was his clear favourite to resume the role. "I gave him the assurance that if he was playing well enough he'd get picked, and then I'd make the captaincy decision after that," revealed Lancaster. "But experience matures players and captains. It'll help him deal with the on-field situations you face as captain. "You've talked about Tom captaining the side - the two times he did it in Argentina are the only times he's done it. It's a big ask to then ask someone to make all those on-field decisions and to get them right, to get a feel for the game as well as concentrate on your own game. It's a different skill. "When you're captaining England, there's a bigger role to play than just purely the on-field decision making. Chris's experience in doing it over the last 12 months will help him - it's a case he's had more time doing it and he'll be better this time around. "If you put together the likes of Geoff Parling, who obviously went on the Lions tour and took the leadership role, Tom Wood, who's captained England, Dylan Hartley, who captains his club, and Lee Dickson's captained his club, Toby Flood's captaining his club… we've got players in there with a range of experiences, and that's what you need in a team." Robshaw, however, is guaranteed little beyond this autumn. Lancaster insists his skipper has the role only for the next three games, not least because of the young open-sides who are expected to push the incumbent hard. The 27-year-old has sometimes been denigrated as a 'six and a half' rather than a specialist open-side, although his coach believes some of that criticism should be borne by those around him. "An open-side's game is dependent on the team," said Lancaster. "The priority is to make sure the team plays well, because if the team plays well, then open-sides tend to play well. "We have young players who are more in that (specialist) sort of mould - Matt Kvesic, obviously, Will Fraser, Luke Wallace - but we need a little bit more consistency from them in order to justify picking one of them ahead of someone like Chris." </body>

      <title>Holloway departs as Palace boss</title>
      <description>Ian Holloway leaves his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent after less than a year in charge.</description>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent  after less than a year in charge at Selhurst Park. Holloway, 50, guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, but had won only one league game this term. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. "Ian felt that a new approach might help keep us in the division," chairman Steve Parish said.  "It's a completely different challenge for Ian and a completely different challenge for us at the club. "Ian's been very noble and he's come forward and said: 'I can't do it.' I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it." Assistant manager Keith Millen will take temporary charge  for the game against Arsenal on Saturday. Although the club lost star player Wilfried Zaha to Manchester United, Holloway was allowed to bring in 16 players during the summer. "I have pride in the job we've both done," Holloway said. "We need to shut up shop in this division. At the minute we've got a whole new group there. "I have to hold my hand up and say we didn't keep the spirit that got us up. "We changed too much too quickly." He added: "This club needs an impetus of energy - but I just feel tired to be honest. I'm worn out." Palace won 3-1 against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August, but they have lost their seven other league games this season. Palace are 19th in the Premier League table and speculation had surrounded Holloway's position following a meeting with Parish after the Fulham defeat, despite the chairman telling BBC Radio 5 Live before the game his job was secure. Parish said he would consult Holloway when it came to appointing a new manager and that the club needed someone with more top-flight experience. "We've got a whole group of people who are only really used to the Championship and dropped them into the Premier League," added Parish. "I think we both realised we need someone with more experience at this level." Holloway ended a three-year spell at Blackpool - who he guided to promotion to the Premier League in 2010 before being relegated back to the Championship the following season - to join the Eagles, succeeding Dougie Freedman. Palace were fourth in the Championship table when Holloway arrived, but held onto a play-off place thanks to an 89th-minute winner from Mile Jedinak in the final game of the season against Peterborough. After beating Brighton in the play-off semi-finals, an extra-time Kevin Phillips penalty secured promotion against Watford at Wembley. </body>

      <title>England top order must deliver - Cook</title>
      <description>Captain Alastair Cook says England's top three batsmen must find their form if they are to retain the Ashes in Australia.</description>

      <body>England's batsmen must find their form if the team are to retain the Ashes in Australia, says captain Alastair Cook. Openers Cook and Joe Root plus number three Jonathan Trott struggled as the hosts relied heavily on their bowlers to secure a 3-0 victory in the summer. "Top-order runs are vitally important down under," said Cook. "400 is the bare minimum to get in the game, so that is the job of the top order." England arrive in Australia on Friday with the first Test on 21 November. They beat their hosts 3-1 in 2010-11 - their first triumph down under for 24 years - and followed up with victory on home soil in July and August this year. Cook's men are seeking to become the first England side since 1890 to win four Ashes series in a row and the Essex batsman accepts his team are rightly regarded as favourites to beat Australia, who have lost seven of their past nine Tests. "I think that's a fair comment when you win the last three series, but I don't think it makes much difference," the 28-year-old said. "I thought we coped with [being favourites] pretty well last summer. But if you look at Australia as a whole, not many sides win there so it is no mean feat. "That is the challenge. We know what we have got to do. Score big first-innings runs and apply pressure with the ball." Cook went past 50 on just two occasions this summer, but failed to compile a century and ended up scoring 277 runs at an average of 27.7. However, he has fond memories of his previous Ashes series down under, when he scored 766 runs at an average of 127.67. "I didn't execute as well as I could have done this summer," he said. "I had a good time there last time. It would be great to repeat some of those feats. "I enjoy batting in those conditions. The ball can be flying past your ears. It's a real test of the skills you need against fast bowling." England will play warm-up matches in Perth, Hobart and Sydney before the first of the five-match Test series in Brisbane. "The games are important for us to get used to conditions," said Cook. "Ideally all the batters will get some time in the middle and the bowlers will get some miles in their legs. That's the ideal scenario." Kevin Pietersen will fly out to Australia 48 hours later than the rest of the squad after being granted compassionate leave. It is understood the batsman has been given the dispensation following the death of a friend. The 33-year-old is expected to be available for England's first warm-up game against Western Australia in Perth, which begins on 31 October. </body>

      <body>A school which was forced to close due to an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider has said it will reopen as normal on Thursday. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean after an infestation of false widow spiders were found on Monday. There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the creatures. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of a rise in the sightings of the species. The academy's vice-principal Craig Burns said it was initially thought they were confined to the ICT block but more were then found in other parts of the school. He said: "Unfortunately during the afternoon more false widow spiders were identified in other areas of the academy. "The health and safety of our students, colleagues and visitors to the school is our first priority and closing the school for the day will allow the pest control to clear the spiders to ensure they do not pose a risk to anyone." He apologised for the inconvenience and said they would be texting parents to remind them the school would be open on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. </body>

      <title>Husband jailed for cellar girl rapes</title>
      <description>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a domestic servant for nearly a decade are jailed.</description>

      <body>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a servant for nearly a decade have been jailed. Ilyas and Tallat Ashar brought the girl, who is deaf, from Pakistan and kept her at their home in Eccles, Salford, where she slept in the cellar. Ilyas Ashar, 84, who was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, was jailed for 13 years at Manchester Crown Court. Tallat Ashar, 68, convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking, got five years. Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family. The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity. Ilyas Ashar was also found guilty of benefit fraud and trafficking. Judge Peter Lakin, sentencing, said the couple had not shown any remorse. He said: "You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. "You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. You exploited her physically, mentally and economically. "There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity - you two took that away from her, you consigned her to a life of misery and degradation." He added: "You are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people." The victim was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family and also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. The court heard a proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. The couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was given a 12-month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work after she was also found guilty of benefit fraud. The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned, the court heard. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language, enabling her to be interviewed by police. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said an appropriate name would be "Miss Courageous" after she spent 34 days in total being cross-examined. He said: "She is a remarkable young woman, a young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court." The passport used to allow the girl into the UK claimed she was 20, and it was a matter of "mystery and concern" how immigration officials at Heathrow did not spot the difference in age, he said. Those involved in her development since her discovery have described her progress like "a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis". </body>

      <body>A number of people have been arrested in Scotland under the Terrorism Act during an operation focused on dissident Irish Republicans. Police Scotland said they were arrested at several locations under section 41 of the Act "on suspicion of committing various offences". It is believed that those who were arrested are being held at Glasgow's high-security Govan Police Station. The Security Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland were involved. A statement about the operation from Police Scotland Asst Ch Con Ruaraidh Nicolson said: "It focused on the activities of individuals sympathetic to dissident Republicanism but who are not affiliated to any specific group. "Police Scotland has led the operation which has involved a number of officers, including specialist units, and public safety has been a priority throughout. "We are confident as a result of these arrests there is no risk to the public. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage." </body>

      <body>Six of Edinburgh's 13 licensed saunas are to close after the city council refused to grant licences. The Licensing Sub Committee assessed information on the saunas, including reports from the police and objectors. A submission by Police Scotland, calling for a ban on items of a sexual nature in saunas, was withdrawn without any discussion. Safe sex campaigners were angered by condition, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. After the meeting, committee convener Councillor Gavin Barrie said: "The committee has carefully reviewed all the information presented, including information from any objectors and reports from Police Scotland. "Each application was considered on its individual merits and of the 13 Public Entertainment licences that were considered today, seven have been renewed." Earlier this year, six saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. </body>

      <body>The man accused of attempting to murder County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend in Chicago three years ago will not testify at his trial. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, announced his decision at Cook County Criminal Court in the American city on Wednesday. Ms McShane, who was left brain-damaged by the attack, and Stacy Jurich were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. The jury will begin deliberating on Wednesday following closing arguments. They must decide on each of the 25 charges Mr Viramontes faces, the most serious being two of attempted murder, two of aggravated battery and two of armed robbery. Earlier, without the jury present, the judge had dismissed a defence application to dismiss the attempted murder charges for lack of evidence, claiming there was no intent to kill. The judge said he would leave it to the jury to decide. The court heard that police stopped two black men with blood on their shirts in the immediate aftermath of the assault and robbery. The initial description of the attacker, given by Ms Jurich at the scene, was that of a medium-built black man. A "flash" alert went out to all units in the Bucktown area where the attack took place and beyond. Officer Melissa Delpair said she stopped a vehicle with the two black males inside close to the scene half an hour after the attack. She noticed what appeared to be blood on both their shirts. After taking details and a brief conversation, she let them go. The officer was being questioned by a defence lawyer after the state rested its case against Mr Viramontes. The defence also called a detective who took a written statement from Marcy Cruz, Mr Viramontes' co-defendant, who has testified against him during the trial. Detective Rolando Rodriguez agreed there was a correction in the statement, where Cruz stated she had a baseball bat in her van that morning but that Mr Viramontes did not have it with him when he ran "to rob the white girls". Among the final witnesses was a detective involved in the investigation, who interviewed Ms Jurich in hospital two days after the attack. Detective Robert Carrillo admitted Ms Jurich told him she was attacked by a black man with a silver bat. But she also said it might have been carried out by a male Hispanic. Mr Viramontes is a light-skinned Hispanic. The officer said investigators did not follow up on initial statements made by Cruz, who mentioned individuals named Jamaica and Junior as being involved in the events that morning. Police were sure she was lying and "pretty much knew" who was involved, Detective Carrillo said. Another detective, Randy Troche, said Ms Jurich told him a black man walked towards the two young women and passed them as the pair made their way towards the viaduct where the attack happened. Detective Troche was given the job of tracking down the two black men stopped in a car near the scene, one of whom is known as Junior. He never managed to find them. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, who is now 27, is unable to speak and struggles to walk or do simple tasks as a result of the injuries she sustained in the beating. She had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. </body>

      <body>A grandmother has spoken for the first time about her horrific experience of being dragged under a van during a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Matthew Tvrdon's eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killed Karina Menzies and injured 17 as he used his van as a "weapon" targeting women and children. A year on from the incident, Jill White told BBC Radio Wales she had undergone 13 operations and was in a wheelchair. She had been at a petrol station when Tvrdon randomly attacked. Tvrdon admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act in June this year. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. On 19 October 2012, Ms White had been shopping with her mother, her grand-daughter and daughter, and was filling her car with fuel at the Asda supermarket petrol station in Leckwith when Tvrdon pulled up next to her. He left his van and randomly started hitting the side of her vehicle with a steering lock, which led to Ms White's mother suffering a heart attack in the car. "Apparently, I came round the front of the car to look at the damage," she said. "I must have said to him 'What do you think you're doing' and he put his foot down and drove straight at me. "I went backwards... he knocked me straight unconscious. He drove over my body. "My daughter was screaming and running after him. He stopped because people were beeping their horns and trying to stop him from getting out of the garage. He reversed back, my body dropped, and then he drove back over me again." She described how she was still under the van and being dragged out to the main junction as her daughter chased after the van screaming 'my mother's under the van'. "He stopped at the junction and my body dropped and my daughter thought I was dead. She was on top of me seeing if I was alive, screaming. "He came back at the two of us and drove over the both of us, then dragged the both of our bodies a further 50 yards, I think it was." Ms White and her daughter were the last people to be injured during the day's events before police were able to stop and arrest Tvrdon at nearby Llandough. She said her life would never be the same again. Last Saturday a service took place at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely to mark the first anniversary of Karina Menzies's death and the series of hit-and-runs. Ms Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. A memorial party was held last Friday evening by Ms Menzies's sister Samantha who is now bringing up the girls. </body>

      <title>Confusion over HS2 cash for Wales</title>
      <description>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project.</description>

      <body>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project. Finance Minister Jane Hutt has told AMs there was a £35m budget increase coming in 2015-16 as a result of £832m UK expenditure on HS2. But the UK Treasury has categorically denied this, saying that HS2 spending is not being passed on. Ms Hutt is now facing calls for an urgent clarification amid claims she may have misled AMs. The issue of whether Wales should receive additional funding from the HS2 rail project has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. It would have meant around £35m extra for Wales in 2015-16 and set a precedent for potentially billions more over the lifetime of the project. But the Treasury said the Welsh government's claim was mistaken - and HS2 was excluded from what is known as "Barnett consequentials". Under that process, if extra money is spent on projects in England in services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, Wales receives a slice of extra money too. That process would normally include transport spending - but not in the case of HS2, according to Treasury officials. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: "At the spending round, Wales received Barnett consequentials in the normal way; this excluded funding for HS2. "The government is clear HS2 will be a vital part of our national infrastructure, boosting regional growth across the country and providing vital capacity the UK needs to compete in the global race. "As with any government spending Barnett consequentials will be considered at the next spending review." A spokesperson for the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: "It is crucial that the finance minister clarifies this issue as soon as possible because if what the Treasury says is true, the finance minister has misled the finance committee. "Assembly members expect the information provided to them by the Welsh Government to be accurate and correct." Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>Tunisia declares mourning for police</title>
      <description>Tunisia's president declares three days of national mourning for eight officers killed by suspected militants in central Sidi Bouzidi province.</description>

      <body>Tunisia's president has announced three days of national mourning for eight officers killed by suspected militants in the central Sidi Bouzidi province. President Moncef Marzouki was speaking on the second anniversary of the country's first free elections. Earlier, PM Ali Larayedh confirmed the government would resign after talks with the opposition on appointing a caretaker administration were complete. The negotiations are aimed at ending months of political crisis in Tunisia. The prime minister said his moderate Islamist-led government was committed to the "principle of relinquishing power in line with the different phases envisaged in the roadmap". "We will not submit to anyone except the interests of the country," he said. His address came after thousands of anti-government protesters marched through the capital, Tunis, calling for the government to go. The political crisis was triggered by the assassination of two prominent opposition politicians earlier this year. The deadlock has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring. Earlier this month, the governing Ennahda party agreed to step aside in favour of a caretaker government, which would run the country until fresh elections are held. Ennahda and the opposition now have three weeks to appoint the interim cabinet. They also have one month to adopt a new constitution, electoral laws and set an election date. Since the 2011 revolt, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. The president paid his respects to the "souls of the martyrs who were martyred today" in a speech broadcast live on national TV. Members of the National Guard had surrounded a building in the village of Sidi Ali Bououn, following a tip-off that a suspicious group was hiding there, officials said. A fierce gun battle ensued during which both security forces and militants were killed. The president said the militants were responding "to the painful blow" on 17 October, when security forces killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who the authorities said had carried out a deadly attack on a police patrol. At least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of Tunis. The interior ministry blamed militants belonging to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group, who were linked to the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July. Their deaths triggered mass protests against the government. Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists - charges it strongly denies. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. </body>

      <body>At least two UN peacekeepers have been killed and six others wounded in a suicide attack in northern Mali, UN spokesman Olivier Salgado has said. A bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle to the checkpoint in Tessalit town before blowing himself up, he added. A local official told Reuters news agency that two civilians, including a baby, had also been killed. The UN has nearly 6,000 troops in Mali to tackle militant Islamists. Its special representative to Mali, Bert Koenders, earlier this month called for more troops to be deployed following an upsurge in bombings and rocket attacks. French troops captured northern Mali's key cities and towns from the militants after launching an operation to oust them in January. It handed security responsibility to the UN force in July. The force, known as Minusma, has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel. The two peacekeepers who were killed in the attack were from Chad, Mr Salgado said. "The provisional toll is two dead and six injured," he added. A government official in Tessalit, Cheick Fantamady Bouare, said four people had been killed in total, including a child, Reuters reports. </body>

      <body>A Chinese newspaper has published a rare front-page plea for the release of one of its journalists held by police. The New Express, based in Guangzhou, called for Chen Yongzhou, who was detained last week, to be freed. The paper said Mr Chen's detention was linked to reports he wrote about a part state-owned construction equipment company based in Hunan. Police in Hunan have confirmed the journalist has been detained for "damage to business reputation''. Earlier this year, Mr Chen wrote several reports about Zoomlion, which is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government. Zoomlion issued a statement after one New Express article, which alleged it had improperly accounted for sales, caused its share price to drop. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange in late May, the company called the claims "false, groundless and misleading". The New Express led its article with a large three-character headline that read "Please Release Him". It said it had remained quiet so far because it feared Mr Chen, who was detained on 19 October, might be mistreated. "We always thought that as long as we report responsibly then there would be no problem; and even in the event of a problem, we can publish corrections and apologise; if it is really serious, and we lose a court case, we will pay or shut down if we have to," the editorial said. "But the fact is, we are too naive. Chen Yongzhou had spent three days and three nights [in custody] before he saw a lawyer," it added. Like all Chinese newspapers, the New Express comes under strict state control, but it has nonetheless gained a reputation for investigative journalism, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai. "We are a small newspaper, but we have the backbone no matter how poor we are," the paper said in its piece. Recent years have seen sporadic clashes between Chinese media outlets and the authorities. In January, journalists at the Guangdong-based Southern Weekly newspaper called for a propaganda chief to quit, after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute. The row sparked small protests and displays of solidarity from other media outlets before the issue was resolved. There have been strong reactions to the news of Chen Yongzhou's detention from users of weibo, China's version of Twitter. Around 30 lawyers have put forward their names to rally support for Mr Chen and organised a virtual body - "Observation Group on the Detention of New Express Reporter Chen Yongzhou". But the group have not said what they plan to do. Media professionals, including journalists, are also using weibo to join the call for police to release Mr Chen. An editor from Dongfang Jinbao, a Henan-based newspaper, wrote: "Support New Express to safeguard the rights of its journalists. The bottom line of consensus in today's society is rule of law. Why did the police arrest Mr Chen? On what legal basis? Is it detention or arrest?" Weibo users have also commented on the censorship of the news of Mr Chen's detention. Another journalist from Henan province added: Within 10 minutes, all major internet portals like Sina, Sohu, Tencent and others have withdrawn the story from their home pages. This is a moment of shame for all (except a few) journalists in China. Other users, however, are urging restraint, saying that it is not good to jump to any conclusions now. The appeal by the New Express comes as the administration led by President Xi Jinping takes a tough approach to press and internet freedom. China's 250,000 journalists and reporters are currently undertaking compulsory on-the-job training. Critics say its apparent aim is to make sure that journalists toe the party line. Some internet bloggers with large numbers of followers on weibo have been arrested for allegedly "spreading rumours". Other high-profile bloggers have stopped posting comments on sensitive issues, apparently fearing reprisals by the government. Rights group Reporters Without Borders has added Xi Jinping to a list of 39 leaders and groups identified as Predators of Freedom of Information in 2013. </body>

      <title>Australia fire threat 'averted'</title>
      <description>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney has been "averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is not yet over.</description>

      <body>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney "has been averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is far from over. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said residents would be able to return to their homes. But he warned that fresh challenges lay ahead in the coming days amid unfavourable conditions. In total, 73 fires are burning across the state, 29 of which are uncontained. Meanwhile, a fire service investigation has concluded the largest of the fires in the Blue Mountains - State Mine near Lithgow - was caused by explosives training at an army range at Marrangaroo last Wednesday. Mr Fitzsimmons confirmed the cause of the fire was "on a live firing range as a result of the detonation of some ordnance", but he said: "Any suggestion that this practice would be on par with someone deliberately lighting fires, reckless or criminal, is outrageous". The defence department has not yet commented on the findings, but acknowledged at the weekend that it could have been the cause. The findings have angered Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill who said the army "should not have been firing" on such a hot, dry day. Hundreds of homes have already been destroyed as more than 3,000 firefighters battle to contain the bushfires in Australia's most populous state. Fire officials had warned that Wednesday's combination of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds could lead to more devastation. But fire chiefs confirmed by the end of the day that not one home had been lost. "If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today, to be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted," Mr Fitzsimmons said. Fire chiefs say a combination of back-burning - the controlled burning of areas with the aim of depriving a fire of fuel - building lines of containment and strategic planning had paid off. In particular, firefighters on Tuesday merged the State Mine fire with one at Mount Victoria to prevent them linking up with the third. "It is absolutely wonderful it did not run," Mr Fitzsimmons said. But he warned people to remain extremely vigilant. "There are still fires flaring up," he said. "There's every prospect we're going to see some more." Many schools in the Blue Mountains are expected to remain closed on Thursday. A major highway through the region is also closed. Emergency alerts remain in place near the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. An emergency alert in Springwood, to the west, has been downgraded to a watch-and-act alert. Earlier, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres linking bushfires to global warming and criticising his decision to repeal a tax on carbon emissions introduced by the previous government. "The official in question is talking through her hat," Mr Abbott told local media. "Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change - they're just a function of life in Australia." Mr Abbott, who took office in September, has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <title>Berlusconi to face bribery trial</title>
      <description>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator in 2006.</description>

      <body>Italian ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator. Berlusconi is accused of paying the left-wing senator 3m euros ($3.9m) to defect to his party in 2006 and help bring down the government. The senator, Sergio De Gregorio, was sentenced to 20 months on Wednesday at a plea bargain hearing in Naples. Berlusconi has been embroiled in a number of trials and says he is the victim of a campaign by the judiciary. He has denied any wrongdoing in this case. His lawyer, Michele Cerabona, said he was confident about the outcome when the trial starts in February. Also charged in the latest case is Berlusconi's former aide, Valter Lavitola, who is accused of being an intermediary in the alleged bribe. The defection of De Gregorio, a senator from Naples, to Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party weakened the government of Romano Prodi, which collapsed in 2008 and triggered elections that returned Berlusconi to power. De Gregorio said on Wednesday: "I urge Silvio Berlusconi to leave the political scene, which would free Italy from a lot of dirt." He added: "I now believe I behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way and was aiming to bring down the Prodi government as part of a sort of holy war being waged by Berlusconi." Mr Lavitola appeared at the Naples hearing, telling it that "there is no proof that I could have known that it was money for a bribe. I would have been simply a conduit". Mr Lavitola was placed under investigation in 2011. He left for South America shortly afterwards and was arrested on his return in April 2012. Berlusconi's supporters have rallied to his defence. PDL lawmaker Daniele Capezzone told Agence France-Presse: "I think Italians fully understand that what has been happening in the past few years is an attack against a political leader who was freely and democratically chosen by millions." Berlusconi, 77, has faced a series of court cases in recent years. On Saturday a court in Milan banned him from holding public office for two years, following his conviction in August for tax fraud. The ban has still to be voted on in parliament. A cross-party panel of the Italian Senate has also recommended his expulsion from the chamber, which means he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi is currently appealing against convictions for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of power and leaking confidential information. Early this month, Berlusconi suffered political humiliation when forced to perform a U-turn in parliament on a confidence vote. Berlusconi had promised to topple the government of PM Enrico Letta by withdrawing his party's support. But he backed down when it became clear that several of his PDL senators would support the government. </body>

      <description>Police in Belgium uncover what is said to be the biggest synthetic drugs production site in the EU - in an old pig shed - and make five arrests.</description>

      <body>Police in Belgium have uncovered what is said to be the biggest synthetic drugs production site in the EU, inside an old pig shed, making five arrests. They swooped on the site near the north-eastern town of Opglabbeek, close to the Dutch border, Europe's police intelligence agency Europol said. Four Dutchmen and one Belgian man were arrested on suspicion of belonging to an organised crime group. Shortly after the raid, a suspicious fire broke out in the shed. The site was reportedly equipped to produce several hundred kilos of ecstasy a week. Spread over 1,000 sq m (10,764 sq ft), it contained high volume custom-made equipment, Europol said. Police seized and removed 35 tonnes of chemicals, finding materials and products valued at around 3m euros (£2.5m; $4.1m). Europol described it in a press release as the "largest synthetic drugs production site ever found in the EU". However, in August, synthetic drugs were found at a laboratory in southern Belgium with a street value of 1.3bn euros, according to Belgian prosecutors. Europol could not be reached for comment on Wednesday afternoon. "With a street value of between 2,250 to 6,000 euros per kilo, MDMA [ecstasy] produced from this laboratory is likely to have resulted in several million euros of turnover each month during active production," Europol said after the new find. The raid took place on Friday but was only reported by Europol on Wednesday. In the early hours of Monday, a suspicious fire broke out in the pig shed, destroying equipment which had not been removed by police. "The fire was so huge that the exact cause cannot yet be confirmed. However, due to the suspicious circumstances, police cannot rule out that it may have been a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence," Europol said. The laboratory found in August was discovered in a rural area near Chimay. Nine men and two women, aged 30 to 50, were arrested and charged with possessing, manufacturing and trafficking drugs. The suspects, from Belgium, Turkey and Poland, were part of an international criminal group, police said. Europol supported Belgian authorities with intelligence analysis during the latest operation and Europol experts helped dismantle the laboratory. "Large-scale MDMA production is back in the EU and we will make it a priority to identify the organised criminal structures responsible," Michael Rauschenbach, Europol's head of serious and organised crime, said on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>
      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>The widows of three Chilean soldiers have launched legal action against the country's Communist Party leader. The Communists' president, Guillermo Teillier admitted his party approved an armed operation targeting the late General Augusto Pinochet in 1986. Five troops escorting the leader died and 11 were injured in the ambush. Around 3,000 people disappeared or died in Chile between 1973 and 1990 and 30,000 are believed to have been tortured by the authorities. In an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in April, Mr Teillier said his party had approved the failed attempt against Gen Pinochet's life and other armed operations in the 1980s. It was "nothing more than a reaction" to what the government had been doing against the Communist leadership, Mr Teillier said. The women taking legal action say they want him jailed for the deaths. "We want justice and equality before the law, that's all we want," one of the widows told Chilean Radio Bio Bio. The recent 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup headed by Gen Pinochet re-ignited nationwide debate about responsibilities and punishment for crimes committed during the period of military rule. The daughters of an ally of the deposed leader Salvador Allende, former President Michelle Bachelet, and of a Pinochet assistant, Evelyn Matthei, are pitted against each other in next months presidential elections, which has heightened the country's political sensitivity further. </body>

      <description>At least 19 policemen and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <body>A 15-year-old Yemeni girl was burned to death by her father for getting in touch with her fiance before their wedding, police say. The 35-year-old man was arrested after the teenager's death in the remote village of Shabaa, in Taiz province. "The father committed this heinous crime on the pretext that his daughter had been keeping in contact with her fiance," a police statement claimed. Local news websites said he had caught the pair chatting on the telephone. Traditional tribal customs in some parts of Yemen prohibit contact between men and women before marriage. Last year, the UN Human Rights council raised concerns about so-called "honour killings" in the country. Perpetrators were not charged with murder, and faced only a six-month to one-year prison sentence, it found. Accorded a low status in the family and community, many Yemeni women are subjected to various forms of violence, deprivation of education, early and forced marriages, sexual abuse, restrictions over freedom of movement, forced pregnancy, and female genital mutilation. Last month, there was an outcry after an eight-year-old girl reportedly died of internal bleeding on the night she wed a 40-year-old man. </body>

      <body>A 14-year-old boy has been charged in the death of a teacher whose body was found in woodland behind her school. Philip Chism was ordered to be held without bail as he was arraigned in a Massachusetts state court for the murder of Colleen Ritzer. The 24-year-old, who taught maths at a high school in the town of Danvers, was found by searchers early on Wednesday. Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said she had been a "very respected, loved teacher". The accused has been charged as an adult and is scheduled to appear back in court on 22 November. All Danvers schools were closed on Wednesday. Officials said there was no reason to believe there were any other suspects. Mr Blodgett said investigators had found blood in a second-floor toilet at Danvers High School and soon located Ritzer, who lived in the nearby town of Andover. The suspect had also been reported missing after not returning from school. He was spotted by police walking along a road in neighbouring Topsfield at about 00:30 local time on Wednesday (04:30 GMT). Ritzer had a Twitter account where she gave homework assignments, encouraged students and described herself as a "math teacher often too excited about the topics I'm teaching". On Wednesday morning, students were shaken by the death. "We are all terrified," Caitlin McBride, a student at Danvers High School, told the Boston Globe. "It's very scary. No-one will ever look at this school the same way anymore." </body>

      <title>Democrats lament 'Obamacare' flaws</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies voice their frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24647561</url>

      <body>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies have begun voicing frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law. House Democrats have complained that technical issues with an insurance enrolment website had overshadowed the law's current and future benefits. Some demanded Mr Obama find and sack those responsible for the glitches. Mr Obama has said technical problems with the site are "unacceptable" and pledges they will soon be fixed. He assured Americans on Monday that technical experts from both inside and outside the government were working around the clock to fix the website and its underpinnings. The health law, known formally as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and is Mr Obama's foremost domestic policy initiative. Among its central provisions are an expansion of the Medicaid public health programme for poor people, a requirement that Americans who do not have insurance from their employers or the government buy it on their own - with subsidies to aid the purchase, and a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. Mr Obama and the law's supporters say it will eventually reshape America's costly and inefficient healthcare industry and provide insurance to most of the estimated 46 million Americans who lack it. At issue currently are websites run by the federal government and some states that serve as online marketplaces where individuals can compare private insurance plans, learn about available public subsidies, and sign up for a plan. The sites, known as exchanges, opened on 1 October. The White House aims to enrol as many as seven million people through the exchanges by the 31 March end of the enrolment period. The central site run by the federal government, healthcare.gov, has been plagued with problems, notably extremely long wait times. Websites run by individual states have not performed as poorly. The Republicans, who have opposed the law from the beginning and have sought to undermine it at every turn, are now calling for the rollout to be delayed and for deadlines for enrolment to be pushed back. The Republicans have also loudly demanded an investigation into the exchanges' shortcomings. "It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable," House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday. Complaints from Mr Obama's fellow Democrats are a relatively new part of the debate. Democratic members of the House of Representatives left a briefing provided by the administration on Wednesday saying they had resolved not to let the problems with one part of the rollout overwhelm the law's benefits. "The president needs to man up, find out who was responsible, and fire them," Minnesota Congressman Richard Nolan said. "You don't get many second chances to get a good first impression." The White House has sought to reassure political allies and Americans at large that the government is working to resolve the issues. The Obama administration has launched what senior officials called a "tech surge," with senior economic aide Jeffrey Zients tasked with analysing and repairing the problems. On Wednesday, executives from top health insurance companies agreed to form new technical teams to help the Obama administration fix the website and the systems underlying it. "We are collaborating closely with the insurers to address problems we have witnessed," the White House said in a statement, after executives from 14 insurance companies met Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration officials. </body>

      <description>How do people avoid picking a terrible flatmate?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24622858</url>

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <title>Death of a British al-Shabab fighter</title>
      <description>Death of a British al-Shabab fighter in Somalia</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24643303</url>

      <body>Last week the Somali Islamist militant group al-Shabab released an hour-long propaganda video - featuring a number of British men the group said had died fighting for it. They included "Talha," a British-Asian man from Tower Hamlets in east London, whom the video said had been killed last November. Speaking in a noticeably British accent, he smiles at the camera while holding a rifle - and explains his motivation for being in the country. "All the Muslims in Britain, especially the people of Tower Hamlets, the citadel I was born in. I call upon you to come to jihad," he says. But who is "Talha" and how did he end up fighting - and dying - for al-Shabab, the group that has claimed responsibility for the Westgate attack in Nairobi? BBC News has learnt that his real name is Taufail Ahmed. He was a British citizen of Bangladeshi heritage who grew up in Stepney Green in east London. A number of British Muslims who knew him before he left for Somalia spoke to BBC News - but none wanted to be identified in case of repercussions. One man, who described himself as a "former schoolmate", said he was "shocked and appalled" Ahmed had joined al-Shabab. He said he was giving a bad impression of British Muslims to the world. Another said he had thought Ahmed had left the UK to study religion in Egypt. The al-Shabab recruit attended Stepney Green School - but during his teenage years he became involved with street gangs. "He was a bit off the rails," said one former acquaintance. "He was involved in fights and turf wars between different areas. There would be fist fights and improvised weapons, like belts and baseball bats. "He was a bit cocky. If there was a group of guys he would be at the front," added another. "Growing up in Tower Hamlets, there wasn't much to do. No-one had any money. There were hardly any youth centres. Young men just hung around on the streets getting into mischief. It was like no-one cared about us." But in his early 20s, they say, Ahmed became more religious, asking questions about his place in the world - and the politics of Muslim identity and the West. The man who had once worn designer clothes switched to traditional Islamic dress and grew a beard. Initially they saw this as a positive thing - someone who had turned their back on a life of petty crime. But they had grown up in an atmosphere in which many British Muslims were angry at what they perceived as unjust Western foreign policy in the Islamic world. Lectures by hard-line preachers were also popular, according to those who knew Ahmed. "When we were in school it was all about Abdullah el-Faisal," said one - referring to a British-Jamaican preacher jailed in 2003 for soliciting the murder of Jews and Hindus. "Cassettes of his lectures got swapped like trading cards," said another, adding the now-dead preacher Anwar al Awlaki had been another influence. And so Ahmed became part of a small, discreet group of British-Asian Muslim men from around Stepney Green who had radical beliefs. "It was chicken and chips jihad," said one acquaintance. "They would meet and discuss global politics in the Muslim world and what they could do to get involved." They told the BBC he and some others from the group had begun to spend a lot of time working on their physical fitness. Only later did they realise that it could have been preparation to fight abroad. One of the others in that group was another British man of Bangladeshi origin - Mohammed Shamim Ali. In August 2008 Ahmed and Ali left for Somalia via Kenya along with another man - Muhammad Jahangir. None seemingly had any connection to Somalia - but they had gone to join al-Shabab. They were responding to a call from the group for foreign volunteers and they never returned to the UK. There is no official statistic for the number of people from the UK who have gone to fight in Somalia. Security officials simply do not know for sure because it is difficult to know who gets into the country over the border from Kenya. Research by BBC News has established the names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Al-Shabab and related organisations. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad and further first-hand research and accounts. The names are not a complete list of people from the UK suspected of having gone to the region to fight. The research found security chiefs believed at least 32 of the identifiable individuals joined jihadists in Somalia - including Ahmed and other members of his cell. BBC News has matched four of the names in its research to confirmed deaths in Somalia - but the true figure is likely to be higher. Typically, al-Shabab uses a nom-de-guerre to describe foreign fighters who have died, making it difficult to confirm real identities. Raffaello Pantucci, from the Royal United Services Institute, sais al-Shabab's appeal was not restricted to those of Somali origin. "There was a certain point in the mid-2000s where the struggle seemed to transform into something with a much more globalist appeal to it," he said. "The result was we saw people from across Britain's Muslim communities being drawn back to participate into the fighting." When Ahmed, Ali and Jahangir reached Somalia, they received financial support from Shabaaz Hussain, another man from east London. Last year he was jailed for raising thousands of pounds to send to the three men. Hussain was helped by the Ali's twin brothers - Mohammed Shabir Ali and Mohammed Shafiq Ali. The group posed as genuine charity fundraisers in London to con unsuspecting Muslims in the East End into handing over cash. The twins have also been jailed. Al-Shabab said Ahmed had met his death in November 2012. The legal charity Reprieve, acting on behalf of his family, says its investigations suggest he was killed on 12 November during an amphibious assault on a fishing village in southern Somalia. A 12-year-old boy was also reportedly killed. About 10 days after his death, police in London told his parents he had died in a gun battle but there had been no British involvement in his death and he had received a Muslim burial. However, Reprieve says it wants to know more about reports that British personnel were involved. Kat Craig, of Reprieve, said: "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." One of the former schoolmates described the death as a "waste." "He was used like a pawn" he said. "He thinks he's helping the Muslim umma [global community]. But he's doing a disservice to British Muslims, and Muslims worldwide." </body>

      <title>How dangerous are false widow spiders?</title>
      <description>How dangerous is Britain's most venomous spider?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24636116</url>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>What does the future hold for the roller coaster industry?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Afghan Sandhurst opens its doors</title>
      <description>Term begins at new Afghan officer academy</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24629331</url>

      <body>The first cadets for the new Afghan National Army officer academy could not all arrive on the same day, because travel from the country's outlying provinces can be hazardous. But as term begins, more than 200 of the expected 270 new recruits in the first intake are in place. Dubbed Sandhurst in the Sand - and modelled on its namesake institution in the UK - the academy will be Britain's only military presence in the country once combat troops have left next year. It aims to take raw but enthusiastic candidates and turn them into the military leaders of the future, able to lead the growing ranks of ordinary Afghan soldiers. The recruits have come from all over the country, and from a wide range of backgrounds. One group queuing up to receive their uniforms, basic sports kit and toiletries included a teacher, a tailor and several recent university graduates. They said they had joined up to defend their country - and they know the scale of the challenge ahead when international troops pull out. More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers were killed last year, with 3,000 seriously injured. The former tailor, Mohammed Navid, from the north of the country, said: "After 2014 all of the American forces will have gone from my province. We have to achieve our security." The ex-teacher, Sadek, said he wanted to serve his country, but was frank about needing a job. A makeshift army camp in tents is housing the first students, as the academy buildings will not be completed for another year. But "it doesn't matter if we are in tents or in a palace", according to Lt Col Graham Hyland, who is leading a team of mentors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "The key thing is getting started, and getting young warrior leaders that the Afghan National Army wants out on to the field." A visit to the camp barber was the first necessity for the recruits, where a close "number one" cut was the only style on offer. Then they were put into small units - "tolay" in Afghan army jargon. Part of the Sandhurst method is that each tolay should be led by a regular army sergeant, and much of the instruction is by sergeants and other non-commissioned officers, or NCOs. Culturally, it might have been problematic to expect officers to be ordered around by a sergeant, but those running the course hope that once the system is accepted, this will improve relationships in the Afghan army beyond the officers, boosting leadership skills throughout. Col Hyland said it had been a challenge at first when the instructors were being trained, but the substance of the course was what mattered. "They're instructing them in all of the tasks we would have the senior NCOs at Sandhurst doing - in drill, skill at arms, map reading, and fieldcraft." The academy is set in a long, low ridge of hills close to Kabul, with plenty of open ground to learn tactics. And the course has been altered significantly to make it Afghan-specific. The military history syllabus includes the analysis of Afghan tactics in past wars against the British, as well as during the mujahideen wars against the Soviet army. There were 10,000 applicants and they were examined anonymously, so theoretically it should not be possible for influential families to secure a place. Without any artificial quotas, those accepted broadly reflect the tribal divisions of the country. This will be far harder to do when the women's course begins next year, as almost all of the female candidates have been from the Hazara ethnic group - the third largest in the country. The overall British commander, Brig Gen Maurice Sheen, said it was important to forge an Afghan national identity in the academy, and not focus on tribal and ethnic backgrounds. He said the country had a warrior tradition, but recruits needed to be taught to be tactically aware. There is a view among international advisers to the Afghan National Army that casualties within its ranks are higher than they need to be, and better leadership in the field would reduce them. Gen Sheen said the students were willing to learn: "They'll sit for a long long time - quite deferential - which can be a problem at times because we have to encourage them to ask more questions. "They have a longer concentration span than we have and seem like sponges. They are open to whatever we are telling them." This first intake will emerge fully qualified as officers next September, and there will be two more groups joining during the year. For those who have been working over the past year to deliver the course, like Col Hyland, watching the new recruits arrive was a good moment. "I couldn't help but grin the whole day," he said. "It was really delightful to see them, cutting around and doing stuff, getting their kit issued, all those sorts of things. "All those vague memories I have got of Sandhurst, and now here we are at the officer's academy at Qargha - it was really good. I was really proud." </body>

      <title>10 ways christening has changed</title>
      <description>... and 9 other ways christenings have changed since 1982</description>

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Smashing way to start a global business</title>
      <description>The Chinese boss who had a novel approach to quality control</description>

      <body>I will never forget my first encounter with the Chinese business leader Zhang Ruimin almost 10 years ago. There, in a glass case in the boardroom of his company Haier was a sledgehammer, not something you normally encounter in corporate surroundings. But Mr Zhang is no ordinary chief executive, as I was reminded in another meeting a month or two ago in his now rather more elaborate headquarters in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The sledgehammer has been removed to the new corporate museum, something that Chinese businesses are very keen on. But though the story has been frequently told, it is still a good way to explain the remarkable company Zhang Ruimin has created over the past 28 years. The Qingdao Refrigerator Plant was close to failure when Mr Zhang was sent in at the end of 1984. Production at the time was at a low ebb, and there was no money to pay the staff. Mr Zhang borrowed some cash from a countryside workers' co-operative, and set about seeing what could be done about the disastrous state of the company his municipal employers had sent him into. Early notices (now on display in the company museum) banned urination and defecation in the factory. Pretty soon Mr Zhang was confronted with complaints from fridge buyers. In response, he gathered the workers in a yard outside the plant, and in front of them 76 substandard fridges were smashed to pieces. A quality quest to revive the plant started from that symbolic sledgehammer attack. And it worked. Qingdao has historic links with Germany; the city's Tsingtao beer - originally brewed by German expats - is now sold all over the world. So echoing its German partner Leibherr, the fridge business adopted a new name - Haier. Then began a remarkable expansion which has turned it into one of the few current Chinese global brands. With 80,000 employees across the globe, it is now one of the biggest manufacturers of white goods in the world. And when you listen to Zhang Ruimin talking about what he has done, you begin to realise that this is not just a dramatic story about a sledgehammer approach to corporate quality. Using a canny blend of Western management thinking and ancient Eastern ideas, Mr Zhang has created a management philosophy which is deep-seated and far-seeing. At first sight, it might seem to be management jargon plus Confucius, Taoism and Sun Tzu's Art of War all jumbled up. But Mr Zhang has developed some potent insights of his own into how a company might evolve in the face of huge new global challenges. And he is still developing them. "I believe in getting the best of both worlds, both from Chinese culture and from the West," says Mr Zhang. "The good thing about Chinese culture is that it treats something as a whole system, the forest not just the trees. You can see this in the difference of approach of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. "Western medicine treats symptoms; traditional Chinese medicine treats the whole body, holistically. Western culture wants everything quantified... so we have also adopted some Western management concepts." "Last week, I was talking to a marketing guru in the US and he told me, 'Good companies meet demands, great companies create demands.' We want to be a great company." Zhang Ruimin set out for me the evolution of his management ideas. "In the 1980s we mostly learned from Japanese companies," he says. "In the 1990s, we learned from American companies: General Electric's Six Sigma insistence on quality, for example. "But now we have incorporated many of those best practices into building our own innovative business model. It's called the win-win model, aligning employee goals with user needs." So (for example) Haier is trying to use the internet to put customers in touch with the people who make the goods, and workers in touch with the product-people who design them. But doing this is hard work. "We're still in a trial and error period and we're still exploring new models," says Mr Zhang. "In the past we had examples to follow but now we are in uncharted territory." Zhang Ruimin calls this "management without leaders". Workers are supposed to be led by the consumers of the things they make. He adds: "The most difficult thing is that in the past the employees would listen to their bosses, but now they don't have any bosses they have to listen to the users." To make this practical, Haier has broken down its 80,000 workforce into hundreds of internal micro companies, each with a profit and loss account even when they are only supplying internal corporate customers. Employees with a good idea are encouraged to find a team to develop it and get it made. Another striking Haier innovation is "catfish management". In fact it's an acknowledgement that there are still leaders even in a so-called leaderless organisation. They may be a bit paranoid, though. It's explained like this: in the sea, a lone catfish creates a commotion when it swims near a school of other fish. Live salmon are transported to market with a catfish in the tank, to keep them active and lively. Haier gives each of its many division bosses a "catfish" shadow manager, who is poised to take over if the man or woman in charge falters. Three months of missed targets, and the catfish deposes the leaders he or she has been shadowing. Sounds ruthless, but the manager (of air conditioners) who I heard from thought it reasonable and even stimulating. Not sure whether Mr Zhang has a catfish, though. When Zhang Ruimin was busy creating waves at Haier in the 1980s and '90s, the great Chinese industrial revolution was changing the whole global landscape. The country was becoming the industrial production house for the world. But most new Chinese companies were making things ordered, devised and designed by Western companies. They made what other people wanted from them. Haier wanted to export its own goods itself... quite a different philosophy, though fridges and washing machines were not exactly state of the art technology. Something else stands out about Haier's export strategy: the company started off in the developed, tough Western markets - Germany, the USA. Mr Zhang says: "Most Chinese companies would choose the other way, the easy markets first and then the more difficult ones later. Many of them started with Africa and South East Asia because those markets had lower expectations of quality. "But we decided to enter the German market first, and people thought we were crazy. "But we tried an experiment. We said, 'Let's put German products and Haier products together and take out the brand and let people see which one is the worst... we hoped it wasn't us.' "We wanted to set the standards high and thus force us to solve all the problems and to meet those high standards. "The Chinese people say, 'If you want to play chess, you need to play it with the master,' because that's the only way you learn." </body>

      <description>Technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones on a rivalry revived</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Hospices: The forgotten pillar of elderly care?</title>
      <description>Do hospices offer the answer to elderly care?</description>

      <body>Elderly care is one of the most pressing issues in the NHS. Whether it is the quality of hospital care or the affordability of care homes, ministers are busy trying to improve services. But we have heard very little about hospices. Yet, about a fifth of people - 120,000 a year - get help from them before they die. And compared to hospitals and care homes, they are doing much better at making their final days, weeks and months comfortable. According to the official bereaved families survey produced by the Office for National Statistics, over 80% of people feel hospices treat patients with dignity and respect compared to just over half in hospitals. A similar picture emerges with the administering of pain relief. But is there more that hospices could do? The sector certainly thinks so. It has set up the Commission into the Future of Hospice Care to put forward its case. In a report published this week it says hospices could be playing more of a role - and in turn relieving the pressure on hospitals and AandE units in particular. But to realise the potential the commission wants both hospices themselves and the NHS to raise their game. Hospices, it says, need to innovate. For example, many of the most forward-thinking have started providing much more care in people's homes. Some will have ten times as many people on their books in the community as they will have in their actual hospice building. But to transform themselves they need help. The network of 200-plus hospices in the UK, which receive about a third of their funding from the NHS and two thirds from charitable donations, has largely developed around caring for cancer patients. It means many are not properly equipped to care for the complexities of dementia and multiple illnesses that many of the elderly have these days. To combat this, the commission says it needs the NHS to help with training staff. But it also wants GPs and ambulance crews to engage more with hospices by sending more patients to them instead of hospital when appropriate. Prof Dame Barbara Monroe, vice chair of the Commission into the Future of Hospice Care, believes such measures could have a significant impact. "Modern hospices grew out of a response to appalling deficits in care for people facing the end of life," she says. "Now nearly 50 years on, there are still too many shameful lapses which have dented public confidence in the care system. "Hospices have a unique opportunity to once again lead a new revolution to help transform care." </body>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there is growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - £211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of £189,900 in the first year. Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>TB challenge over 'missing' millions</title>
      <description>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization says.</description>

      <body>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization has said. Finding these missed cases is one of the biggest challenges in TB care and control, the WHO's report says. Twelve countries including India, South Africa and Bangladesh account for the majority of undiagnosed individuals. But the WHO says the target to halve the number of TB deaths by 2015 is still within reach. Global TB programme director Dr Mario Raviglione said 56 million people had been cured and 22 million lives had been saved in the past 15 years and half of the highest-burden countries were on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals targets, but there remained a number of major challenges. "The two major challenges we identified are that of detecting in the system what we call the missed cases," he told the BBC. " There are about three million people that we estimate had TB and that are not officially in the system, that are not reported. "Some of them may actually be never detected, some of them are in fact hidden in the private sector, in the non-state sector, that does not notify the cases. "So that is I think one of the biggest challenges we have to face and there are opportunities there because we know where these cases may be." The WHO says TB testing services need to be urgently improved in many countries, with help from non-governmental organisations NGOs and volunteers. And in others, particularly Asian countries, more needs to be done to ensure figures on TB are compiled and reported centrally. The other major challenge highlighted is drug-resistant TB. The WHO estimates that 450,000 people became ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 2012. China, India and Russia have the highest rates. But the report adds that by 2012, deaths from TB had been reduced by 45% since 1990, meaning the target of a 50% reduction by 2015 is within reach. Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres' (MSF) infectious disease specialist Dr Philipp du Cros said: "Three in four people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are still not diagnosed, and 17,000 of those diagnosed in 2012 did not even start treatment." He said: "These shocking figures are an indictment of the global failure to tackle drug-resistant tuberculosis head on. People are paying for this failure with their lives." Dr Du Cros added: "Unless we take urgent action, we will continue to see an increase in harder-to-treat drug resistant strains of TB." He said more research was needed to make treatments for TB shorter, more effective and less damaging for patients. "An extra $2bn was needed to plug a funding gap in the treatment of TB, he added. </body>

      <title>Saturated fat heart disease 'myth'</title>
      <description>The risk from saturated fat in foods such as butter, cakes and biscuits is being overstated and demonised, according to a cardiologist.</description>

      <body>The risk from saturated fat in foods such as butter, cakes and fatty meat is being overstated and demonised, according to a cardiologist. Dr Aseem Malhotra said there was too much focus on the fat with other factors such as sugar often overlooked. It is time to "bust the myth of the role of saturated fat in heart disease", he writes in an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal. But the British Heart Foundation said there was conflicting evidence. It added reducing cholesterol through drugs or other means does lower heart risk. Studies on the link between diet and disease have led to dietary advice and guidelines on how much saturated fat, particularly cholesterol, it is healthy to eat. Millions of people in the UK have been prescribed statins to reduce cholesterol levels. Dr Malhotra, a cardiology registrar at Croydon University Hospital, London, says the "mantra that saturated fat must be removed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has dominated dietary advice and guidelines for almost four decades". He says saturated fat has been "demonised" and any link with heart disease is not fully supported by scientific evidence. The food industry has compensated for lowering saturated fat levels in food by replacing it with sugar, he says, which also contributes to heart disease. Adopting a Mediterranean diet - olive oil, nuts, oily fish, plenty of fruit and vegetables and a moderate amount of red wine - after a heart attack is almost three times as powerful in reducing mortality as taking a statin, writes Dr Malhotra. However, Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, says studies on the link between diet and disease frequently produce conflicting results. Unlike drug trials, it is difficult to carry out a controlled, randomised study, he says. "However, people with highest cholesterol levels are at highest risk of a heart attack and it's also clear that lowering cholesterol, by whatever means, lowers risk." Cholesterol levels can be influenced by many factors including diet, exercise and drugs, in particular statins, he adds. "There is clear evidence that patients who have had a heart attack, or who are at high risk of having one, can benefit from taking a statin. "But this needs to be combined with other essential measures, such as eating a balanced diet, not smoking and taking regular exercise." Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower rates of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol can also be reduced by eating a healthy, balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight and doing regular physical activity. </body>

      <title>Black women get 'worse' breast cancer</title>
      <description>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop 'worse' breast cancer, research reveals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24624517</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70631000/jpg/_70631948_coloured_sem_of_breast_cancer_cells_dividing-spl-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop "worse" breast cancer with a poorer prognosis, research suggests. This group has larger, more aggressive tumours with a higher risk of recurrence. This is despite having the same access to treatment, the study in the British Journal of Cancer shows. As yet unidentified biological factors may be to blame, say the Cancer Research UK investigators. Such women might respond less well to breast cancer drugs like tamoxifen because of the genetic make-up of their tumour, they say. The research team, based at the University of Southampton, looked at data from nearly 3,000 UK women - of whom 118 were black - who were younger than 40 when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. Even when individual differences such as body weight and treatment variations such as availability of chemotherapy were taken into account, black ethnicity remained an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Dr Ellen Copson and colleagues say there have been similar findings in the US, suggesting this could be an international trend, but further research is needed to try to pin down the exact cause or causes. Early diagnosis may also play a role if black women are less aware of the symptoms or less "breast aware", and so less likely to identify worrying changes, they say. This could mean their cancer is diagnosed at a later stage which would reduce the chance of successful treatment and recovery. Although NHS treatment is designed to be equal for all, some cultural factors such as recent immigration to the UK or language barriers may in practice affect use of health services, they say. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: "It's worrying that ethnic background may be a factor influencing a woman's chance of surviving breast cancer. We know that some ethnic populations carry higher genetic risks of getting certain types of breast cancer, but if this difference is down to symptom awareness or access to healthcare, that is particularly concerning. "More research is needed to look into the reason why young black women have higher rates of recurrence, but in the meantime women of any ethnic background should be aware of what is normal for their breasts and get any new lumps or anything unusual checked out by their GP. More often than not breast changes won't mean cancer, but it's best to get any unusual changes checked out." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save £500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24616801</url>

      <body>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Child bone-marrow transplant 'first'</title>
      <description>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique for sick children.</description>

      <body>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique. They say the method should help with donor shortages since it does not require a perfect cell match. Mohammed Ahmed, who is nearly five years old, was among the first three children in the world to try out the new treatment. He has severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and had been waiting for a suitable donor for years. Mohammed, who lives in Milton Keynes, was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital when he was a year old. His condition - a weak immune system - makes him more susceptible to infections than most, and a bone marrow transplant is the only known treatment. While Mohammed was on the transplant waiting list, he became extremely sick with swine flu. At that time, his doctors decided Mohammed's only real hope was to have a mismatched bone-marrow transplant, with his father acting as the donor. Mohammed's dad, Jamil, agreed to give the experimental therapy a go. Before giving his donation, Jamil was first vaccinated against swine flu so that his own bone-marrow cells would know how to fight the infection. Mohammed's doctors then modified these donated immune cells, called "T-cells", in the lab to engineer a safety switch - a self-destruct message that could be activated if Mohammed's body should start to reject them once transplanted. Rejection or graft-v-host disease is a serious complication of bone-marrow transplants, particularly where tissue matching between donor and recipient is not perfect, and is one of the most difficult challenges faced by patients and their doctors. Mismatched transplants in children - where the donor is not a close match for the child - are usually depleted of T-cells to prevent graft-v-host disease, but this causes problems in terms of virus infections and leukaemia relapse. The safety switch gets round this - plenty of T-cells to be transfused and later killed off if problems do arise. Thankfully, the transplant carried out in 2011 was a success - Mohammed's doctors did not need to use the safety switch. Although Mohammed still has to take a number of medicines to ward off future infections, his immune system is now in better shape. Jamil said: "We waited for a full match but it did not come. By the grace of God, we took the decision to have the treatment. "Now he is all right. Sometimes we forget what he has been through. We are just so grateful." He said Mohammed would still need close monitoring and regular health checks over the coming years, but his outlook was good. Dr Waseem Qasim, ‎consultant in paediatric immunology at Great Ormond Street Hospital and lead author for the study, said the new approach should hopefully mean children who received a mismatched transplant could enjoy the same chance of success as those given a fully matched transplant. "We think Mohammed is cured of his disorder. He should be able to lead a fairly normal life now." A full report about Mohammed's therapy and the research by Great Ormond Street Hospital, King's College London and the Institute of Child Health has just been published in PLoS One journal. There are currently about 1,600 people in the UK waiting for a bone-marrow transplant and 37,000 worldwide. Just 30% of people will find a matching donor from within their families. Donations involve collecting blood from a vein or aspirating bone marrow from the pelvis using a needle and syringe. </body>

      <body>Health bosses have vowed to launch legal proceedings to move French travellers who are blocking a car park used by hospital workers. Officials had asked the travellers to move 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The travellers arrived at the 300-space car park late Saturday on afternoon. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday morning, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." After the Tuesday afternoon deadline passed, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was now resorting to the law. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm today," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental illness. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 900 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>
      <description>"The hopes and fears I have for my daughter"</description>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24550586</url>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Union may back Ineos survival plan</title>
      <description>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos.</description>

      <body>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos. About half the workforce at the complex had rejected new terms and conditions proposed by Ineos, prompting the firm to announce the plant's closure. Subject to agreement by the workforce, Unite may now accept the changes in a "last-ditch effort" to keep it open. The union is to present its proposals to Ineos at a meeting on Thursday. It remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that the company would reverse its decision. However, the company had said while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Previously, Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond spoke again to management and unions to try and seek further resolution. He also convened an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss the on-going situation. Afterwards he said there was still room for negotiation between both parties, particularly since Unite had put forward fresh proposals to the company. Mr Salmond said: "We should give time for the proper consideration of this offer, especially given that we know an agreement between both sides was very close last week, and the prize is a viable future for Grangemouth. "However, given that the current position is the one we always feared possible given the stalemate between the sides, if an agreement between Ineos and Unite is not possible then we will continue to pursue our contingency options of finding a buyer for the site." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - met in London to discuss this issue. Mr Carmichael told BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme that Mr Davey had a 40-minute "positive" talk with Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. </body>

      <title>Private christening for baby prince</title>
      <description>The christening of Prince George, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, has taken place in London.</description>

      <body>The christening of Prince George has taken place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London. The prince, third in line to the throne, was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The christening was private, with only senior royals, four members of the Middleton family, the seven godparents and their spouses among the 22 guests. Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was born in London on 22 July. The duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. Attending a reception at Buckingham Palace after the event, the Queen told guests how much she had enjoyed the ceremony. "It was very nice though, wasn't it?" she told the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, at the event for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. The godparents, announced earlier, are Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall. Mrs Tindall, wife of former England rugby player Mike Tindall, is Prince William's cousin, while the other six godparents are all friends of the royal couple. Prince George was baptised in a replica of the lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The duke and duchess chose two hymns, two lessons and two anthems for the christening. The hymns were Breathe on Me, Breath of God and Be Thou My Vision. Lessons from St Luke and St John were read by Pippa Middleton and Prince Harry, and the anthems were Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand and the Lord Bless You and Keep You. The anthems were sung by the Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, which performed at the royal couple's wedding. The ceremony took about 45 minutes. After the ceremony, celebrity photographer Jason Bell was expected to take a picture of the Queen and princes Charles, William and George together. This will echo a 1894 picture from the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother - George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. The picture is expected to be released on Thursday. </body>

      <title>US health chief becomes new NHS boss</title>
      <description>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service.</description>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there is growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - £211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of £189,900 in the first year. Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accuse David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <body>The names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to al-Shabab - and related organisations - have been established by the BBC. Most of those on the list travelled to Somalia to fight or attempted to do so. Somali-based militants al-Shabab carried out the deadly attack on the Westgate mall in neighbouring Kenya. Lawyers for the family of one British recruit known to have died in Somalia are investigating whether he was killed in a raid involving western military. Al-Shabab is fighting to impose a brutal version of Islamic law on the country and the group is linked to al-Qaeda. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad, and further first-hand research and accounts. It is not a complete list of people from the UK who are suspected of having gone to fight because it is impossible to establish or estimate with any certainty how many Westerners have taken up arms in Somalia. The research found that security chiefs believe at least 32 of the identifiable individuals went to fight. A further seven were named in British court cases as having attempted to enter Somalia, but their plans were discovered and disrupted. Others have been accused or convicted of raising money for al-Shabab, or facilitating the travel of others. Seven people on the list returned to the UK - but the fate of most of the others is completely unknown. Four of the men on the list are known to be dead, including men who featured on a video released by the group a week ago. The video included a message from a young man named as "Talha", who asked Muslims in Tower Hamlets - a borough in east London - to join the jihad in Somalia. Talha, whose real name was Taufail Ahmed, died in Somalia in November 2012. The Foreign Office said it had confirmed the death to his family, who are of Bangladeshi origin. He grew up in Stepney Green in east London. The BBC has tracked down people who knew him at school. They say he fell into a life of gang crime before leaving that world behind in favour of an extreme interpretation of Islam, before disappearing from the UK. "For British Muslims he's doing a disservice," said one former schoolmate. "For Muslims around the world, he is doing a disservice." In the al-Shabab video, the narrator says that "Talha" died after an attack involving American and British forces. The government has not commented on that claim but his family has asked the legal charity Reprieve to investigate. "The family were notified by British police officers. The FCO [Foreign Office] have knowledge of the incident and have told us that Taufail Ahmed received a Muslim burial," said Kat Craig from Reprieve. "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." </body>

      <title>Husband jailed for cellar girl rapes</title>

      <body>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a servant for nearly a decade have been jailed. Ilyas and Tallat Ashar brought the girl, who is deaf, from Pakistan and kept her at their home in Eccles, Salford, where she slept in the cellar. Ilyas Ashar, 84, who was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, was jailed for 13 years at Manchester Crown Court. Tallat Ashar, 68, convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking, got five years. Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family. The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity. Ilyas Ashar was also found guilty of benefit fraud and trafficking. Judge Peter Lakin, sentencing, said the couple had not shown any remorse. He said: "You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. "You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. You exploited her physically, mentally and economically. "There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity - you two took that away from her, you consigned her to a life of misery and degradation." He added: "You are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people." The victim was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family and also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. The court heard a proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. The couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was given a 12-month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work after she was also found guilty of benefit fraud. The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned, the court heard. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language, enabling her to be interviewed by police. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said an appropriate name would be "Miss Courageous" after she spent 34 days in total being cross-examined. He said: "She is a remarkable young woman, a young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court." The passport used to allow the girl into the UK claimed she was 20, and it was a matter of "mystery and concern" how immigration officials at Heathrow did not spot the difference in age, he said. Those involved in her development since her discovery have described her progress like "a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis". </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The badger cull in Gloucestershire is to be extended for eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". No action was taken against Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police, and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, following an internal review by the forces concerned into their conduct. But the head of West Mercia Police told the Commons Home Affairs Committee the handling of the affair had been "clumsy" and the report and its recommendations should be independently reviewed. However, the chief constables of Warwickshire and the West Midlands said they did not feel the same because they believed the original decisions had been properly reached. Sgt Jones, Insp MacKaill and Det Sgt Hinton's meeting with Mr Mitchell took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where the Tory MP was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he had used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis, a member of the committee, accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Mr Vaz said their answers had been "most unsatisfactory" and he would be calling their media adviser, John Gaunt, to answer questions about his role in the affair. Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. But Chief Constable David Shaw, head of West Mercia Police, said he now believed the report should be independently reviewed, suggesting the whole episode had been "unedifying" and had damaged public confidence in the police. He also said he had written to Mr Mitchell to offer him a "profound and unreserved" apology for what had happened. Also giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording of the meeting indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked". The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Mr Mitchell's friends have accused them of pursuing a political agenda and called for root-and-branch changes to guarantee police accountability. Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <body>A grandmother has spoken for the first time about her horrific experience of being dragged under a van during a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Matthew Tvrdon's eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killed Karina Menzies and injured 17 as he used his van as a "weapon" targeting women and children. A year on from the incident, Jill White told BBC Radio Wales she had undergone 13 operations and was in a wheelchair. She had been at a petrol station when Tvrdon randomly attacked. Tvrdon admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act in June this year. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. On 19 October 2012, Ms White had been shopping with her mother, her grand-daughter and daughter, and was filling her car with fuel at the Asda supermarket petrol station in Leckwith when Tvrdon pulled up next to her. He left his van and randomly started hitting the side of her vehicle with a steering lock, which led to Ms White's mother suffering a heart attack in the car. "Apparently, I came round the front of the car to look at the damage," she said. "I must have said to him 'What do you think you're doing' and he put his foot down and drove straight at me. "I went backwards... he knocked me straight unconscious. He drove over my body. "My daughter was screaming and running after him. He stopped because people were beeping their horns and trying to stop him from getting out of the garage. He reversed back, my body dropped, and then he drove back over me again." She described how she was still under the van and being dragged out to the main junction as her daughter chased after the van screaming 'my mother's under the van'. "He stopped at the junction and my body dropped and my daughter thought I was dead. She was on top of me seeing if I was alive, screaming. "He came back at the two of us and drove over the both of us, then dragged the both of our bodies a further 50 yards, I think it was." Ms White and her daughter were the last people to be injured during the day's events before police were able to stop and arrest Tvrdon at nearby Llandough. She said her life would never be the same again. Last Saturday a service took place at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely to mark the first anniversary of Karina Menzies's death and the series of hit-and-runs. Ms Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. A memorial party was held last Friday evening by Ms Menzies's sister Samantha who is now bringing up the girls. </body>

      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <title>Marine 'executed Afghan prisoner'</title>
      <description>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial of three Royal Marines charged with murder has heard.</description>

      <body>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial has heard. Three Royal Marines, who cannot be named, are charged with murdering the unknown man while on duty in 2011. One of the men, known as Marine A, is accused of shooting the prisoner in the chest at close range. A helmet-mounted camera inadvertently filmed the incident and the footage was shown to the court. The three deny the charges against them. Charges against two further marines - D and E - were dropped in February but the anonymity order granted last year remains in place. Last November, Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett said the defendants would be at "real and immediate risk" from "organised terrorist activity and lone wolves", if their names were made public. Speaking to the board at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, prosecutor David Perry said the murder took place on 15 September 2011 when the three defendants were on active service. "The prosecution case is that Marine A used a pistol and deliberately shot and killed the unknown man. "It was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. The prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution, a field execution," he said. Even though Marine A used the pistol, Marines B and C "encouraged and assisted Marine A in carrying out the killing," he added. Mr Perry said the incident had occurred after a patrol base in Helmand Province had come under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire fired from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, which he described as a legitimate operation. The marines had come across the injured man in a field, the court heard. Marine A wanted to move him from an area where an air balloon, known as a PGSS, was in use for observation. "He knew full well what he was going to do," Mr Perry said. The court heard that after Marine A shot the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol he swore at him and said: "There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." The prosecutor said Marine A then said to the other marines: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention." Mr Perry accused the three defendants of using the Afghan man's injuries as a "cloak" to conceal their own actions, reporting he had died from wounds inflicted by the helicopter. Five recordings caught on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B were shown to the panel. In one conversation between Marine A and C about shooting the man one serviceman is overheard asking "Anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?" before another replies loudly "Nope." In another Marine C was heard asking A if he should shoot the man in the head, which was refused with more offensive language as "obvious". A journal which had been written by Marine C also gave an insight into what happened during the alleged murder, the court heard. The men - who were hidden from view of the public gallery of the courtroom by the use of a screen - were arrested by Royal Military Police last October after civilian police found suspicious footage on a serviceman's laptop in the UK. They are accused of murdering the Afghan national contrary to Section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. The court martial is expected to see further video evidence either later on Wednesday or on Thursday. One clip is said to show a body being moved from an open field to a mound, while another allegedly shows the shooting of the injured man by Marine A. The trial could last up to three weeks. The marines have been released on bail. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <title>Officer failed to mention Duggan gun</title>
      <description>A police firearms officer saw the "silhouette" of a pistol in Mark Duggan's hand but did not mention it in his written account, an inquest hears.</description>

      <body>A police firearms officer did not mention that he saw Mark Duggan with a gun in his initial account of the shooting, an inquest has heard. The officer, known only as W70, said he had been advised by his lawyer to leave it out of his written statement. He told the inquest that he saw Mr Duggan reach towards his waist before revealing "the shape" of a handgun moments before he was shot. Mr Duggan, 29, was shot dead by police in Tottenham, north London, in 2011. The written account was made by W70 within a few hours of the shooting. Barrister Leslie Thomas, for the Duggan family, showed the jury police guidelines which said the initial account of such an incident should have included why the officer thought the discharge of firearms was necessary. Mr Thomas asked W70 why he had mentioned his police colleague had been hurt and that shots had been fired, but not the claim that Mr Duggan was holding a gun. W70 said he had told his legal adviser on the night of the shooting that Mr Duggan was holding a gun, but the lawyer told him to leave it out of his initial account. He later said he was told by a solicitor that if he himself had not used force then he should not put that detail in his initial account. The jury was then shown a detailed statement written by W70 three days later in which he said he had seen Mr Duggan with a gun. The officer was within touching distance of V53, who shot Mr Duggan. The officer was asked by Ashley Underwood QC what had happened to the gun after Mr Duggan was shot, and he replied: "I honestly don't know, sir." He said as soon as Mr Duggan hit the ground, he started shouting at him "where's the gun?". He then looked on and under him but could not find one. The jury has been told that a gun was later found 10-20ft (3-6m) from where Mr Duggan fell to the ground. The inquest has also heard from officer W42 who was accidentally shot by his colleague when one of the bullets went through Mr Duggan's body. He told the jury that he was behind Mr Duggan and saw his right elbow move out, at which point he said he was concerned enough to shout "he's reaching, he's reaching". Mr Duggan was shot dead in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, on 4 August 2011. He had been travelling in a minicab when he was stopped by an armed unit in a planned operation. His death sparked riots in a number of English cities. The inquest continues. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have attended a service to remember nine people murdered in the Shankill bomb. A service to mark the 20th anniversary of the bombing took place in West Kirk Presbyterian Church. The DUP MP Willie McCrea has raised the anniversary of the bombing at Westminster. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, the South Antrim MP said that "no-one should equate victims with murderers". In response the prime minister said "no-one should glorify terrorism". He urged people in Northern Ireland to "come together for a shared future". During the service shops on the Shankill Road pulled down their shutters as a mark of respect and part of the road has been closed. Hundreds of people stood outside the church to hear the special memorial service. Pupils from the Harmony Primary School and the Girls Model laid flowers at a nearby memorial and at the actual bomb site further up the road. This coincided with the time the bomb went off exactly 20 years ago. Nine Protestant civilians were killed in the 1993 attack in Belfast, as well as one of the IRA bombers - Thomas Begley. Among the dead were two children aged seven and 13. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in October in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. </body>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>David Beckham inspires philosophy</title>
      <description>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week.</description>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Pumpkin boat sets new 'world record'</title>
      <description>An artist claims he has set a new world record by paddling a giant pumpkin across a Portsmouth dock.</description>

      <body>An artist who works with outsized vegetables claims he has set a new world record of exactly two minutes for the fastest 100m paddle in a pumpkin. Dmitri Galitzine sourced two 600lb (270kg) and 800lb (360kg) squashes at the Mere Brow Giant Pumpkin Show. Speaking after his 100m paddle in Portsmouth, he said it had been "difficult" but paddling the pumpkin through the dock had "felt good". Guinness World Records said it had received notification of the attempt. Mr Galitzine, who also plans to cross the Solent from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight in a giant gourd powered by an outboard motor, spent days working with boating experts to create two pumpkin vessels. The larger pumpkin was fitted with an outboard motor for the Solent crossing, while the smaller one was hollowed out for the world record paddle attempt. His record attempt was recorded by independent adjudicators, and will be examined later, Guinness World Records said. It had said Mr Galitzine would have to complete the 100m paddle within three minutes to set a new record. Mr Galitzine, who creates giant vegetable sculptures influenced by English folk culture, has no sailing experience but was supported by Portsmouth marine entrepreneur Jonny Boys. His next challenge will be the three-mile crossing of the Solent on Thursday from Stokes Bay in Gosport, using a hollowed out pumpkin powered by an outboard engine. A handful of pumpkin regattas, in which boaters race each other in giant pumpkin ships, have been held in the US and Nova Scotia in Canada since the 1990s. A pumpkin boat race also took place in Hampshire in 2006. Mr Galitzine said that while sailing pumpkins was "not common... the crossing over the Solent is different to the regattas in the US, [as] it's over three miles and there are strong tides". </body>

      <title>Dublin Roma girl returned to family</title>
      <description>DNA tests prove that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have proved that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter. The family said they were "delighted" that their daughter had come home. They also said they would be taking legal advice, and that serious questions have arisen over the procedures used in the case. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl had been removed by police from her Tallaght home and taken into temporary care. The family have supported calls from human rights group Pavee Point for an independent inquiry into the investigation. In a statement issued through their solicitor the family said: "Her removal has been a cause of huge upset to her parents, her brothers and sisters, and the young girl herself. "They now intend to concentrate on looking after their family and, in particular, in trying to reassure their daughter that she will be left in their care. "Our clients also wish to say they do not believe that what has happened to their family over the few days should ever have happened. "They do not accept that this was any proper or sufficient basis to take their daughter away from them. "They believe that there are very serious questions arising about the procedures used in this case but are going to wait for things to settle down and consider their position and that of their daughter in light of recent events and will be taking legal advice in respect of this." A 21-year-old sister of the child, who can not be identified for legal reasons, said their mother had not eaten for three days because she was so distraught. "Everyone was very sad," she said. The sister added she hoped no other family would have to go through a similar ordeal. Meanwhile, a two-year-old boy from a Roma family who was briefly taken into care in County Westmeath has been reunited with his parents. The boy was taken from his family on Tuesday in Athlone and returned a day later. Alan Shatter, the Irish minister for justice, said he will be asking the Garda (Police) Commissioner for a report on the two cases. A Garda statement said: "Protecting vulnerable children is of paramount importance to An Garda Síochána and we continue to work in partnership with the HSE (Health Service Executive) and other agencies to ensure children's safety. "An Garda Síochána want to assure the community that we take extremely serious all reports received from members of the public concerning child welfare issues." The Irish police action took place against the background of international interest in the case of a blonde-haired child being taken from a Roma family in Greece last week. Greek police are investigating whether the girl had been abducted. </body>

      <body>The man accused of attempting to murder County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend in Chicago three years ago will not testify at his trial. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, announced his decision at Cook County Criminal Court in the American city on Wednesday. Ms McShane, who was left brain-damaged by the attack, and Stacy Jurich were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. The jury will begin deliberating on Wednesday following closing arguments. They must decide on each of the 25 charges Mr Viramontes faces, the most serious being two of attempted murder, two of aggravated battery and two of armed robbery. Earlier, without the jury present, the judge had dismissed a defence application to dismiss the attempted murder charges for lack of evidence, claiming there was no intent to kill. The judge said he would leave it to the jury to decide. The court heard that police stopped two black men with blood on their shirts in the immediate aftermath of the assault and robbery. The initial description of the attacker, given by Ms Jurich at the scene, was that of a medium-built black man. A "flash" alert went out to all units in the Bucktown area where the attack took place and beyond. Officer Melissa Delpair said she stopped a vehicle with the two black males inside close to the scene half an hour after the attack. She noticed what appeared to be blood on both their shirts. After taking details and a brief conversation, she let them go. The officer was being questioned by a defence lawyer after the state rested its case against Mr Viramontes. The defence also called a detective who took a written statement from Marcy Cruz, Mr Viramontes' co-defendant, who has testified against him during the trial. Detective Rolando Rodriguez agreed there was a correction in the statement, where Cruz stated she had a baseball bat in her van that morning but that Mr Viramontes did not have it with him when he ran "to rob the white girls". Among the final witnesses was a detective involved in the investigation, who interviewed Ms Jurich in hospital two days after the attack. Detective Robert Carrillo admitted Ms Jurich told him she was attacked by a black man with a silver bat. But she also said it might have been carried out by a male Hispanic. Mr Viramontes is a light-skinned Hispanic. The officer said investigators did not follow up on initial statements made by Cruz, who mentioned individuals named Jamaica and Junior as being involved in the events that morning. Police were sure she was lying and "pretty much knew" who was involved, Detective Carrillo said. Another detective, Randy Troche, said Ms Jurich told him a black man walked towards the two young women and passed them as the pair made their way towards the viaduct where the attack happened. Detective Troche was given the job of tracking down the two black men stopped in a car near the scene, one of whom is known as Junior. He never managed to find them. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, who is now 27, is unable to speak and struggles to walk or do simple tasks as a result of the injuries she sustained in the beating. She had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. </body>

      <title>Confusion over HS2 cash for Wales</title>
      <description>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project.</description>

      <body>There is confusion about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project. Finance Minister Jane Hutt has told AMs there was a £35m budget increase coming in 2015-16 as a result of £832m UK expenditure on HS2. But the UK Treasury has categorically denied this, saying that HS2 spending is not being passed on. Ms Hutt is now facing calls for an urgent clarification amid claims she may have misled AMs. The issue of whether Wales should receive additional funding from the HS2 rail project has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. It would have meant around £35m extra for Wales in 2015-16 and set a precedent for potentially billions more over the lifetime of the project. But the Treasury said the Welsh government's claim was mistaken - and HS2 was excluded from what is known as "Barnett consequentials". Under that process, if extra money is spent on projects in England in services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, Wales receives a slice of extra money too. That process would normally include transport spending - but not in the case of HS2, according to Treasury officials. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: "At the spending round, Wales received Barnett consequentials in the normal way; this excluded funding for HS2. "The government is clear HS2 will be a vital part of our national infrastructure, boosting regional growth across the country and providing vital capacity the UK needs to compete in the global race. "As with any government spending Barnett consequentials will be considered at the next spending review." A spokesperson for the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: "It is crucial that the finance minister clarifies this issue as soon as possible because if what the Treasury says is true, the finance minister has misled the finance committee. "Assembly members expect the information provided to them by the Welsh Government to be accurate and correct." Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <body>Six of Edinburgh's 13 licensed saunas are to close after the city council refused to grant licences. The Licensing Sub Committee assessed information on the saunas, including reports from the police and objectors. A submission by Police Scotland, calling for a ban on items of a sexual nature in saunas, was withdrawn without any discussion. Safe sex campaigners were angered by condition, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. After the meeting, committee convener Councillor Gavin Barrie said: "The committee has carefully reviewed all the information presented, including information from any objectors and reports from Police Scotland. "Each application was considered on its individual merits and of the 13 Public Entertainment licences that were considered today, seven have been renewed." Earlier this year, six saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. </body>

      <body>A school which was forced to close due to an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider has said it will reopen as normal on Thursday. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean after an infestation of false widow spiders were found on Monday. There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the creatures. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of a rise in the sightings of the species. The academy's vice-principal Craig Burns said it was initially thought they were confined to the ICT block but more were then found in other parts of the school. He said: "Unfortunately during the afternoon more false widow spiders were identified in other areas of the academy. "The health and safety of our students, colleagues and visitors to the school is our first priority and closing the school for the day will allow the pest control to clear the spiders to ensure they do not pose a risk to anyone." He apologised for the inconvenience and said they would be texting parents to remind them the school would be open on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. </body>

      <body>A woman has been killed in a fall of about 80ft (24m) from the third floor of a clothes store in Liverpool. Police said Susan Wood, 57, from Kirkby was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor of the Church Street Primark at 18:00 BST on Tuesday. She had been seen moments before at a balcony next to the third-floor escalators. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. The coroner has been informed. She was treated by a doctor at the scene but was pronounced dead later at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. An North West Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the drop from the third-floor escalators was about 80ft. Liverpool City Council, which has health and safety responsibilities for the city's shops, said it was waiting for the results of police inquiries before deciding whether to investigate. Primark has not been available for comment. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later. Five years ago, at the same store, a three-year-old girl fell through a gap between the escalators to the lower ground floor while travelling up to the third floor with her family. She broke her left leg and arm and suffered internal injuries but survived. </body>

      <title>Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad</title>

      <body>Manchester United moved a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad. Inigo Martinez's second-minute own goal - which also owed much to superb work by Wayne Rooney - ensured United maintained their unbeaten record in the competition this season. United manager David Moyes will have made three points his sole objective after the disappointing 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton on Saturday and in a week when their European campaign has been reduced to a sideshow by revelations in former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's new autobiography. And on the night when United gave a trial to Old Trafford's new 'singing section',  they at least had something to celebrate - unlike the 6,000 colourful visiting fans who followed Sociedad. The La Liga side made United work hard for the win but it was one they fully deserved despite some anxious moments, particularly when Antoine Griezmann hit the post with a first-half free-kick. Rooney was once again United's main source of danger as he continued the outstanding form he has shown this season. If there are any complaints from Moyes, they will have centre on his side's inability to finish the game off earlier - as well as some questionable defending that offered Sociedad hope. And at least Moyes was finally able to move the agenda away from his predecessor Ferguson, who has claimed the headlines this week and overshadowed this important Champions League game as he raked over his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford. Once again, this was not a fluent United performance but the result will give them added confidence ahead the return meeting away to Sociedad in a fortnight. Moyes decided against risking striker Robin van Persie, who has been suffering with toe and groin injuries - but Rooney's irresistible form meant the Netherlands international was not missed early on as United were ahead inside two minutes. Rooney demonstrated perfect technique and speed of thought to evade three defenders in the area, only to curl a shot against the post with keeper Claudio Bravo beaten. As Sociedad appeared to have survived, Martinez sliced the rebound hopelessly into his own net. Sociedad had a valid claim for Javier Hernandez being offside as Martinez did his unwitting work but Dutch referee Bas Nijhuis and his officials were unmoved by the complaints. Rooney was at the heart of everything early on and almost added a second after 12 minutes - but Bravo was equal to his volley from Rafael's cross. From hesitant early beginnings, Sociedad grew in confidence into the game and were desperately unlucky not to equalise before half-time. David De Gea had already saved athletically from Haris Seferovic but he could do nothing to stop Griezmann's free-kick and was relieved as it bounced away off the woodwork. Sociedad continued to improve after the break but United were creating chances as Phil Jones saw his header blocked by Bravo and Antonio Valencia's low, angled shot struck the post. Fortunately for United, Sociedad had lost the impetus they gather in the early moments of the second half and did not make United pay for those missed chances. Manchester United boss David Moyes: "Yes [I was frustrated] because we had it on Saturday in a Premier League game when we lost a late goal. If we had scored five or six today it wouldn't would have looked out of place. "I'm concerned we gave away couple of free kicks on the edge of the box. But Wayne Rooney was absolutely terrific tonight, I was shouting at him in the last five minutes though. "We just want a top player like Wayne to play well. I said from day one that his training was great. I think England have seen that. But we need to see it all the time." </body>

      <body>Sergio Aguero scored twice as Manchester City came from behind to beat CSKA Moscow and reignite their Champions League Group D campaign. Manuel Pellegrini had complained about the pitch at the Khimki Arena, and the City boss must have feared the worst when Zoran Tosic put the hosts ahead. The former Manchester United player lobbed Joe Hart before Aguero levelled after David Silva's cross. Aguero capped a gutsy City display by heading home Alvaro Negredo's cross. It was far from comfortable for Pellegrini and his players, who were forced to endure some anxious moments against the Russian champions to record their second away win of the group stage. Indeed City goalkeeper Hart had to produce a fine stop with an outstretched leg to deny Japan international Keisuke Honda an equaliser deep into stoppage time. But victory over CSKA in the return game at the Etihad Stadium on 5 November ought to allow City to start planning for the knockout stages for the first time. After their flat performance against Bayern Munich three weeks ago, City now have six points from three games, three more than the Russians. CSKA painted the pitch green in some areas after Pellegrini said it was "unbelievable" Uefa passed it fit for use following heavy rain. But the Chilean's pre-match criticism of the surface was quickly brushed aside as City peppered the hosts' goal. Aguero, Yaya Toure, who said after the game he had been subjected to racist chanting, and Negredo all had chances before poor defending in the 32nd minute allowed Tosic to produce a moment of quality that was all too rare during his stint at Old Trafford between January 2009 and June 2010.  The 26-year-old Serbia international found the net with a delicate lob after Honda won an aerial duel with Javi Garcia. Yet the character lacking from Pellegrini's side in the 3-1 home defeat by Bayern last month was in ample supply as Aguero spearheaded the turnaround. Within two minutes the visitors were level, the Argentina forward getting ahead of marker Sergei Ignashevich to turn Silva's low cross home from close range. And three minutes before the interval, Aguero put City in front with his ninth goal of the season, a brave header following a delightful cross from the outside of Negredo's boot. CSKA pushed forward in search of an equaliser after half-time, Tosic proving a serious threat as City lived dangerously. Substitute Ahmed Musa thought he had equalised in the 80th minute with a terrific 20-yard strike but his effort was ruled out as Pontus Wernbloom fouled Toure. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "I'm very happy. The result is very important for the team. The whole team concentrated with intensity on a difficult pitch. "Aguero and Silva are both top players and every match they show how they can play football. We are not in the next round but this is very important for us." </body>

      <title>Holloway departs as Palace boss</title>
      <description>Ian Holloway leaves his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent after less than a year in charge.</description>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent  after less than a year in charge at Selhurst Park. Holloway, 50, guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, but had won only one league game this term. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. "Ian felt that a new approach might help keep us in the division," chairman Steve Parish said.  "It's a completely different challenge for Ian and a completely different challenge for us at the club. "Ian's been very noble and he's come forward and said: 'I can't do it.' I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it." Assistant manager Keith Millen will take temporary charge  for the game against Arsenal on Saturday. Although the club lost star player Wilfried Zaha to Manchester United, Holloway was allowed to bring in 16 players during the summer. "I have pride in the job we've both done," Holloway said. "We need to shut up shop in this division. At the minute we've got a whole new group there. "I have to hold my hand up and say we didn't keep the spirit that got us up. "We changed too much too quickly." He added: "This club needs an impetus of energy - but I just feel tired to be honest. I'm worn out." Palace won 3-1 against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August, but they have lost their seven other league games this season. Palace are 19th in the Premier League table and speculation had surrounded Holloway's position following a meeting with Parish after the Fulham defeat, despite the chairman telling BBC Radio 5 Live before the game his job was secure. Parish said he would consult Holloway when it came to appointing a new manager and that the club needed someone with more top-flight experience. "We've got a whole group of people who are only really used to the Championship and dropped them into the Premier League," added Parish. "I think we both realised we need someone with more experience at this level." Holloway ended a three-year spell at Blackpool - who he guided to promotion to the Premier League in 2010 before being relegated back to the Championship the following season - to join the Eagles, succeeding Dougie Freedman. Palace were fourth in the Championship table when Holloway arrived, but held onto a play-off place thanks to an 89th-minute winner from Mile Jedinak in the final game of the season against Peterborough. After beating Brighton in the play-off semi-finals, an extra-time Kevin Phillips penalty secured promotion against Watford at Wembley. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Many might want to do something about urban foxes in their area. There's an increasingly popular and humane way to outwit them.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>

      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>Smashed Hits: The Windmills Of Your Mind</title>
      <description>The Windmills Of Your Mind was made famous by Noel Harrison, who's died aged 79. Why has it stood the test of time?</description>

      <body>"Round... like a circle in a spiral, a wheel within a wheel..." so begins The Windmills Of Your Mind, made famous by Noel Harrison. Why has the song lasted so long, asks Ben Milne. Only two minutes and 20 seconds long in the version by Harrison, who's died aged 79, Windmills of Your Mind is a rush of lyrical free association about turning circles, spirals and the passage of time ("The autumn leaves were turning to the colour of her hair"). With its imagery of "a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own" and apples "whirling silently in space" Windmills occupies a singular place in the pop canon where psychedelia and easy listening meet. "It's a very peculiar and intriguing song," says Bob Stanley, musician and author of pop history Yeah Yeah Yeah. "It gets called easy listening but really isn't at all." Stanley says the song was the product of a short-lived era, post-Sgt Pepper, "where what had been the straight set... jumped on the psychedelia bandwagon". It was written by French composer Michel Legrand, with English lyrics by husband-and-wife team Alan and Marilyn Bergman (a French version, Les Moulins de mon coeur, was also penned by Eddy Marnay) and was used to memorable effect in the Steve McQueen thriller The Thomas Crown Affair (it won the Oscar for best song in 1968). But what do the lyrics mean? The poet Ian McMillan says Windmills Of Your Mind is similar to some modernist poetry where meanings are kept deliberately mysterious and confusing. He thinks the lyrics are deceptively shallow and warns poetry students not to use them as a template: "People will write something like 'the walls of my despair' or 'the settee of my soul'. 'Windmills of your mind' is a great phrase, and it's a fantastic song, but the words appear to mean something when they don't." Nevertheless the song has become a standard, covered by more than 80 recording artists, as diverse as Dusty Springfield, ex-Specials singer Terry Hall, the Muppets and Kiri Te Kanawa. But for many, it's Noel Harrison's version which still endures, as he delivers in his clipped English accent, "Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that she said?"

      <title>PM to review fixed odds machines</title>
      <description>David Cameron promises to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from High Street betting shops.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to £100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at £100 and the maximum payout at £500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <title>Parking ticket 'grace' period urged</title>
      <description>Councils in England should give drivers five minutes grace after their parking tickets run out before fining them, a committee of MPs says.</description>

      <body>Drivers should be given "five minutes grace" after their parking tickets expire before facing fines, MPs on the Commons transport committee say. It also said councils in England should publish annual parking-charge accounts if they want to prove they are not being used as a "cash cow" The Transport Committee warned it was "neither acceptable nor legal" to use fines to increase revenue. Councils made a surplus of hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it added. The MPs urged ministers to freeze charges, currently capped at £130 in London and £70 outside. Councils said money raised went back into services. Committee chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said: "There is a deep-rooted public perception that parking enforcement is used as a cash cow, so it's essential that local authorities apply stringent transparency." The report said the Local Government Association had calculated a surplus from on- and off-street parking of £411m in 2011/12, while the RAC Foundation put the figure at £565m. The maximum fixed penalty for speeding is £60, unless the case is referred to court. Mrs Ellman argued the charging system was perverse, saying: "Annual parking accounts would allow the public to see how much local revenue is derived from the enforcement of fines, and what proportion of this come from on- or off-street parking charges. "It's right that parking charges be determined locally, but hard to justify fines that substantially exceed penalties for more serious offences like speeding. "Central government should freeze the maximum penalty charge and develop differential fines for less serious parking violations. " Mrs Ellman also said the Department for Transport's rules for councils should include a five-minute "grace-and-favour" period after tickets expire before imposing a fine. A government spokesman said: "We welcome this report, which strengthens the case for changes to be made to parking rules. "The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This government is reining in over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair parking practices, with the levels of parking penalty charges being kept under review." But Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said: "As this report recognises, parking controls are not being used by councils to raise revenue. They are essential for keeping motorists and pedestrians safe, traffic flowing and ensure people can park near their homes and local shops." He added: "Councils always look to be open and transparent with residents on their parking policies. "Any income they make from charges and fines is spent on running parking services, fixing potholes and providing subsidised travel to children and the elderly." Last month, the government said it was considering banning fixed cameras and so-called "spy cars" used by councils to catch people parking illegally. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the idea of getting councils to publish figures, saying it would "illuminate what many drivers regard as the murky world of parking policy". "Parking charges are not inherently wrong but they need to be fair, and where penalties are levied they should be proportionate to the 'crime' committed. "Local authorities are struggling with huge financial pressures but so are drivers. It is unacceptable that car users should be singled out as an easy way of shoring up shrinking budgets." </body>

      <title>Benefit cap 'not achieving aims'</title>
      <description>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its objectives of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than £500 a week, while a £350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given £1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add £2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <description>Death of a British al-Shabab fighter in Somalia</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24643303</url>

      <body>Last week the Somali Islamist militant group al-Shabab released an hour-long propaganda video - featuring a number of British men the group said had died fighting for it. They included "Talha," a British-Asian man from Tower Hamlets in east London, whom the video said had been killed last November. Speaking in a noticeably British accent, he smiles at the camera while holding a rifle - and explains his motivation for being in the country. "All the Muslims in Britain, especially the people of Tower Hamlets, the citadel I was born in. I call upon you to come to jihad," he says. But who is "Talha" and how did he end up fighting - and dying - for al-Shabab, the group that has claimed responsibility for the Westgate attack in Nairobi? BBC News has learnt that his real name is Taufail Ahmed. He was a British citizen of Bangladeshi heritage who grew up in Stepney Green in east London. A number of British Muslims who knew him before he left for Somalia spoke to BBC News - but none wanted to be identified in case of repercussions. One man, who described himself as a "former schoolmate", said he was "shocked and appalled" Ahmed had joined al-Shabab. He said he was giving a bad impression of British Muslims to the world. Another said he had thought Ahmed had left the UK to study religion in Egypt. The al-Shabab recruit attended Stepney Green School - but during his teenage years he became involved with street gangs. "He was a bit off the rails," said one former acquaintance. "He was involved in fights and turf wars between different areas. There would be fist fights and improvised weapons, like belts and baseball bats. "He was a bit cocky. If there was a group of guys he would be at the front," added another. "Growing up in Tower Hamlets, there wasn't much to do. No-one had any money. There were hardly any youth centres. Young men just hung around on the streets getting into mischief. It was like no-one cared about us." But in his early 20s, they say, Ahmed became more religious, asking questions about his place in the world - and the politics of Muslim identity and the West. The man who had once worn designer clothes switched to traditional Islamic dress and grew a beard. Initially they saw this as a positive thing - someone who had turned their back on a life of petty crime. But they had grown up in an atmosphere in which many British Muslims were angry at what they perceived as unjust Western foreign policy in the Islamic world. Lectures by hard-line preachers were also popular, according to those who knew Ahmed. "When we were in school it was all about Abdullah el-Faisal," said one - referring to a British-Jamaican preacher jailed in 2003 for soliciting the murder of Jews and Hindus. "Cassettes of his lectures got swapped like trading cards," said another, adding the now-dead preacher Anwar al Awlaki had been another influence. And so Ahmed became part of a small, discreet group of British-Asian Muslim men from around Stepney Green who had radical beliefs. "It was chicken and chips jihad," said one acquaintance. "They would meet and discuss global politics in the Muslim world and what they could do to get involved." They told the BBC he and some others from the group had begun to spend a lot of time working on their physical fitness. Only later did they realise that it could have been preparation to fight abroad. One of the others in that group was another British man of Bangladeshi origin - Mohammed Shamim Ali. In August 2008 Ahmed and Ali left for Somalia via Kenya along with another man - Muhammad Jahangir. None seemingly had any connection to Somalia - but they had gone to join al-Shabab. They were responding to a call from the group for foreign volunteers and they never returned to the UK. There is no official statistic for the number of people from the UK who have gone to fight in Somalia. Security officials simply do not know for sure because it is difficult to know who gets into the country over the border from Kenya. Research by BBC News has established the names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Al-Shabab and related organisations. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad and further first-hand research and accounts. The names are not a complete list of people from the UK suspected of having gone to the region to fight. The research found security chiefs believed at least 32 of the identifiable individuals joined jihadists in Somalia - including Ahmed and other members of his cell. BBC News has matched four of the names in its research to confirmed deaths in Somalia - but the true figure is likely to be higher. Typically, al-Shabab uses a nom-de-guerre to describe foreign fighters who have died, making it difficult to confirm real identities. Raffaello Pantucci, from the Royal United Services Institute, sais al-Shabab's appeal was not restricted to those of Somali origin. "There was a certain point in the mid-2000s where the struggle seemed to transform into something with a much more globalist appeal to it," he said. "The result was we saw people from across Britain's Muslim communities being drawn back to participate into the fighting." When Ahmed, Ali and Jahangir reached Somalia, they received financial support from Shabaaz Hussain, another man from east London. Last year he was jailed for raising thousands of pounds to send to the three men. Hussain was helped by the Ali's twin brothers - Mohammed Shabir Ali and Mohammed Shafiq Ali. The group posed as genuine charity fundraisers in London to con unsuspecting Muslims in the East End into handing over cash. The twins have also been jailed. Al-Shabab said Ahmed had met his death in November 2012. The legal charity Reprieve, acting on behalf of his family, says its investigations suggest he was killed on 12 November during an amphibious assault on a fishing village in southern Somalia. A 12-year-old boy was also reportedly killed. About 10 days after his death, police in London told his parents he had died in a gun battle but there had been no British involvement in his death and he had received a Muslim burial. However, Reprieve says it wants to know more about reports that British personnel were involved. Kat Craig, of Reprieve, said: "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." One of the former schoolmates described the death as a "waste." "He was used like a pawn" he said. "He thinks he's helping the Muslim umma [global community]. But he's doing a disservice to British Muslims, and Muslims worldwide." </body>

      <title>How do people avoid picking a terrible housemate?</title>
      <description>How do people avoid picking a terrible flatmate?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24622858</url>
      <date>1382524267</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70656000/jpg/_70656535_shallowgrave.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <body>The first cadets for the new Afghan National Army officer academy could not all arrive on the same day, because travel from the country's outlying provinces can be hazardous. But as term begins, more than 200 of the expected 270 new recruits in the first intake are in place. Dubbed Sandhurst in the Sand - and modelled on its namesake institution in the UK - the academy will be Britain's only military presence in the country once combat troops have left next year. It aims to take raw but enthusiastic candidates and turn them into the military leaders of the future, able to lead the growing ranks of ordinary Afghan soldiers. The recruits have come from all over the country, and from a wide range of backgrounds. One group queuing up to receive their uniforms, basic sports kit and toiletries included a teacher, a tailor and several recent university graduates. They said they had joined up to defend their country - and they know the scale of the challenge ahead when international troops pull out. More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers were killed last year, with 3,000 seriously injured. The former tailor, Mohammed Navid, from the north of the country, said: "After 2014 all of the American forces will have gone from my province. We have to achieve our security." The ex-teacher, Sadek, said he wanted to serve his country, but was frank about needing a job. A makeshift army camp in tents is housing the first students, as the academy buildings will not be completed for another year. But "it doesn't matter if we are in tents or in a palace", according to Lt Col Graham Hyland, who is leading a team of mentors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "The key thing is getting started, and getting young warrior leaders that the Afghan National Army wants out on to the field." A visit to the camp barber was the first necessity for the recruits, where a close "number one" cut was the only style on offer. Then they were put into small units - "tolay" in Afghan army jargon. Part of the Sandhurst method is that each tolay should be led by a regular army sergeant, and much of the instruction is by sergeants and other non-commissioned officers, or NCOs. Culturally, it might have been problematic to expect officers to be ordered around by a sergeant, but those running the course hope that once the system is accepted, this will improve relationships in the Afghan army beyond the officers, boosting leadership skills throughout. Col Hyland said it had been a challenge at first when the instructors were being trained, but the substance of the course was what mattered. "They're instructing them in all of the tasks we would have the senior NCOs at Sandhurst doing - in drill, skill at arms, map reading, and fieldcraft." The academy is set in a long, low ridge of hills close to Kabul, with plenty of open ground to learn tactics. And the course has been altered significantly to make it Afghan-specific. The military history syllabus includes the analysis of Afghan tactics in past wars against the British, as well as during the mujahideen wars against the Soviet army. There were 10,000 applicants and they were examined anonymously, so theoretically it should not be possible for influential families to secure a place. Without any artificial quotas, those accepted broadly reflect the tribal divisions of the country. This will be far harder to do when the women's course begins next year, as almost all of the female candidates have been from the Hazara ethnic group - the third largest in the country. The overall British commander, Brig Gen Maurice Sheen, said it was important to forge an Afghan national identity in the academy, and not focus on tribal and ethnic backgrounds. He said the country had a warrior tradition, but recruits needed to be taught to be tactically aware. There is a view among international advisers to the Afghan National Army that casualties within its ranks are higher than they need to be, and better leadership in the field would reduce them. Gen Sheen said the students were willing to learn: "They'll sit for a long long time - quite deferential - which can be a problem at times because we have to encourage them to ask more questions. "They have a longer concentration span than we have and seem like sponges. They are open to whatever we are telling them." This first intake will emerge fully qualified as officers next September, and there will be two more groups joining during the year. For those who have been working over the past year to deliver the course, like Col Hyland, watching the new recruits arrive was a good moment. "I couldn't help but grin the whole day," he said. "It was really delightful to see them, cutting around and doing stuff, getting their kit issued, all those sorts of things. "All those vague memories I have got of Sandhurst, and now here we are at the officer's academy at Qargha - it was really good. I was really proud." </body>

      <title>How dangerous are false widow spiders?</title>
      <description>How dangerous is Britain's most venomous spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>10 ways christening has changed</title>
      <description>10 ways christenings have changed since 1982</description>

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <title>Sex Pistols 'took over my house'</title>
      <description>How a Sex Pistols collection became an obsession</description>

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid £100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had £2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <title>Why Grangemouth matters</title>
      <description>The economic significance of the Grangemouth plant</description>

      <body>Ineos says the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth is to close while the oil refinery will remain open. Around 800 jobs will be affected by the closure. In total Grangemouth employs 1,370 staff and a dispute between union members and staff remains unresolved. The loss of the petrochemicals plant is a major blow and now the focus will be on the refinery which is a key part of the Scottish and UK economy. The Grangemouth refinery supplies 70% of the fuel used at Scotland's filling stations and it also supplies fuel to Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. Grangemouth is an important employer and the 800 jobs lost by the closure of the petrochemicals plant are a big loss. Along with the refinery, Grangemouth employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the site. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the business is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth's refinery is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is due to close. </body>

      <body>Fuel bills may be rising, but pictures in the Sun and the Daily Star show the deserted night-time offices of energy companies "ablaze with light". "They must have money to burn," says the Sun. The Star thinks it goes to show that the big companies are "power mad" - "truly, the lights are on," it says, "but there's nobody at home". The papers know what they think about rising fuel bills - but Sir John Major's call for a windfall tax has led some to revise their view of him. The Daily Mirror calls him "the grey man of British politics" - but says his "explosive intervention" into the political argument has turned him into "an unexpected assassin for Mr Cameron". The Guardian, too, reads his remarks as sending "a political thunderbolt into Downing Street". But the Daily Telegraph points out that "Sir John is in close contact with David Cameron" and it wonders whether he was "flying a kite" for Number 10, testing public opinion. The Times considers that idea too - but rejects it. The paper also rejects Sir John's proposal, saying extraordinary tax measures "may be tempting in the short run" but are "rarely wise" because they undermine the confidence of investors in Britain. Another jolt to received opinion can be found in the Daily Express. The paper's front page boldly declares that "eating fat is good for you". Basing its article on the views of a London heart specialist, the Express questions the conventional advice that people should reduce the amount of saturated fats they eat to minimise the risk of disease. A cartoon on the front of the Times shows a man at breakfast, reading a story that urges him to "eat more butter" and telling his wife that "middle-age spread is good for you". Frances Quinn, "the shock winner" of the Great British Bake Off, is declared by the Daily Express to be Britain's new "Queen of the Kitchen". Almost all the papers find the show irresistible. "Don't let its daintiness fool you," says the Independent, "the programme is a fearsome behemoth of popular television." "Sponge cakes, sex appeal and icing sugar," exclaims the Daily Mail, "what a combination." The Guardian gives space on its front page to one of the defeated finalists, Ruby Tandoh, to voice her concern that the "hyperbolic silliness" of "a programme about cake" could inspire so much "bitterness and bile", even "personal vitriol and misogyny", among commentators on social media and in the press. Perhaps it is the mix of emotions which appeals - the Daily Telegraph comments that "if Premier League baking gets any more popular, next year could well be a bid by BT for the TV rights". David Beckham is felt to be on the receiving end of some, perhaps unfair, remarks in Sir Alex Ferguson's memoirs. "Now that the power's faded," comments the Daily Mirror, "all that's left is settling a few old scores." The Daily Star pays tribute to Sir Alex as "arguably Britain's most successful club manager, ever". But it disputes his estimate of Beckham as someone who failed to fulfil his potential. The Times itemises the former England captain's sporting record, his wealth and his place in world culture. The paper observes: "What a terrible disappointment it must be to be David Beckham." </body>

      <body>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called US President Barack Obama after receiving information that the US may have spied on her mobile phone. A spokesman for Mrs Merkel said the German leader "views such practices... as completely unacceptable". Mrs Merkel called on US officials to clarify the extent of their surveillance in Germany. The White House said President Obama had told Chancellor Merkel the US was not snooping on her communications. "The United States is not monitoring and will not monitor the communications of the chancellor," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday. The US has been on the receiving end of anger from allies over spying allegations based on material said to originate from fugitive American leaker Edward Snowden. Mr Carney told reporters that Washington was examining concerns from Germany as well as France and other American allies over US intelligence practices. But the spokesman did not address whether Mrs Merkel's phone had been monitored in the past. Berlin demanded "an immediate and comprehensive explanation" from Washington about what it said "would be a serious breach of trust". In a statement it said: "Among close friends and partners, as the Federal Republic of Germany and the US have been for decades, there should be no such monitoring of the communications of a head of government." The statement also said that Mrs Merkel had told Mr Obama: "Such practices must be prevented immediately." The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says because the statement was issued after the phone call, there were indications that Mrs Merkel had not been reassured. He says the issue of state monitoring of phone calls is a real one in Germany - Angela Merkel grew up in East Germany, where phone tapping was pervasive. President Obama had assured Chancellor Merkel when he visited in June that German citizens were not being spied upon and our correspondent says she was criticised then by political opponents for not being more sceptical. The German government would not elaborate on how it received the tip about the alleged US spying. But news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published stories based on material from Edward Snowden, said the information had come from its investigations. Mrs Merkel's call comes a day after US intelligence chief James Clapper denied reports that American spies had recorded data from 70 million phone calls in France in a single 30-day period. He said a report in Le Monde newspaper had contained "misleading information". A number of US allies have expressed anger over the Snowden-based spying allegations. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cancelled a visit to the US this month in protest at alleged electronic espionage by the NSA against her country, including of communications at her office. In a speech at the United Nations, she rejected arguments put forward by the US that the interception of information was aimed at protecting nations against terrorism, drugs trafficking and other organised crime. The Mexican government has called the alleged spying on the emails of two presidents, Enrique Pena Nieto - the incumbent - and Felipe Calderon, as "unacceptable". US officials have begun a review of American intelligence gathering amid the international outcry. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>An explosion near the airport in Syria's capital, Damascus, has been followed by a blackout in parts of the country, state media say. Power was reportedly cut after rebel artillery hit a gas pipeline. Residents say the entire capital has been plunged into darkness, while officials have described the power cuts as countrywide. Many parts of Syria have been struck by major power cuts since the start of the country's civil war. "A terrorist attack on a gas pipeline that feeds a power station in the south has led to a power outage in the provinces, and work to repair it is in progress," Syria's state news agency SANA quoted Electricity Minister Imad Khamis as saying. President Bashar al-Assad calls his opponents foreign-backed "terrorists". The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said opposition shelling was aimed at the town of Ghasula, around 2km (1.2 miles) from the airport. "It is likely this was a large-scale operation planned well in advance," Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Activists say a huge fire was seen blazing near the airport. It is unclear whether anyone was hurt. Meanwhile the SOHR says a car bomb has hit a military checkpoint in a western suburb of Damascus, causing multiple casualties among security forces. The head of the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical arsenal has said that Damascus is due to hand over its disarmament plan on Thursday. In a press conference on Wednesday, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it expected Syria's initial declaration within the next 24 hours. The OPCW and the UN have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in Syria since 1 October. They have said that the Syrian government has been co-operating with the watchdog's work. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. </body>

      <title>Vatican suspends 'bishop of bling'</title>
      <description>The Vatican suspends a German bishop dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over alleged lavish spending, including a $42m renovation of his home.</description>

      <body>The Vatican has suspended a senior German Church leader dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over his alleged lavish spending. Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is accused of spending more than 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on renovating his official residence. The Vatican said it deemed "appropriate... a period of leave from the diocese" for the bishop. The suspension comes two days after he met the Pope to discuss the matter. "A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties", a Vatican statement said. It said a Church commission would rule on the matter, but did not say where Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would go or what he would do while the inquiry was held. The head of Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, Alois Glueck, welcomed the Vatican's decision. He said: "Pope Francis's decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation has become an increasing burden for the faithful there, and in all of Germany, over recent weeks." Bishop Tebartz-van Elst - and his spending habits - had become infamous in Germany, where many people pay Church tax to the state. The tax raised 5.2bn euros for Catholics and 4.6bn euros for Protestants in 2012. Calls were made for the bishop to resign after he was accused of lying under oath about his spending. He was criticised for a first-class flight to India to visit the poor. But his official residence is at the heart of the criticism, after renovations were originally costed at 5.5m euros. German media are reporting that the residence was fitted with a bath that cost 15,000 euros, a conference table for 25,000 euros and a private chapel that cost 2.9m euros. The story has attracted heavy coverage and has stoked controversy among Catholics. It was in Germany that Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. The BBC's Alan Johnston, in Rome, says all this was bound to play badly with the new Pope, who has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of senior clerics whose lifestyles seem a little too lavish. Pope Francis has also signalled his intention to clean up the Vatican's finances, appointing a commission to advise him on reforms. There is no surprise in Rome that the Vatican has ordered the bishop's suspension from his duties while the spending row is investigated, our correspondent adds. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the daughter of a Protestant pastor, said that she had expressed "hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church". In his absence, the bishop's diocese will be administered by Limburg's vicar general, Wolfgang Roesch. </body>

      <title>Berlusconi to face bribery trial</title>
      <description>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator in 2006.</description>

      <body>Italian ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator. Berlusconi is accused of paying the left-wing senator 3m euros ($3.9m) to defect to his party in 2006 and help bring down the government. The senator, Sergio De Gregorio, was sentenced to 20 months on Wednesday at a plea bargain hearing in Naples. Berlusconi has been embroiled in a number of trials and says he is the victim of a campaign by the judiciary. He has denied any wrongdoing in this case. His lawyer, Michele Cerabona, said he was confident about the outcome when the trial starts in February. Also charged in the latest case is Berlusconi's former aide, Valter Lavitola, who is accused of being an intermediary in the alleged bribe. The defection of De Gregorio, a senator from Naples, to Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party weakened the government of Romano Prodi, which collapsed in 2008 and triggered elections that returned Berlusconi to power. De Gregorio said on Wednesday: "I urge Silvio Berlusconi to leave the political scene, which would free Italy from a lot of dirt." He added: "I now believe I behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way and was aiming to bring down the Prodi government as part of a sort of holy war being waged by Berlusconi." Mr Lavitola appeared at the Naples hearing, telling it that "there is no proof that I could have known that it was money for a bribe. I would have been simply a conduit". Mr Lavitola was placed under investigation in 2011. He left for South America shortly afterwards and was arrested on his return in April 2012. Berlusconi's supporters have rallied to his defence. PDL lawmaker Daniele Capezzone told Agence France-Presse: "I think Italians fully understand that what has been happening in the past few years is an attack against a political leader who was freely and democratically chosen by millions." Berlusconi, 77, has faced a series of court cases in recent years. On Saturday a court in Milan banned him from holding public office for two years, following his conviction in August for tax fraud. The ban has still to be voted on in parliament. A cross-party panel of the Italian Senate has also recommended his expulsion from the chamber, which means he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi is currently appealing against convictions for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of power and leaking confidential information. Early this month, Berlusconi suffered political humiliation when forced to perform a U-turn in parliament on a confidence vote. Berlusconi had promised to topple the government of PM Enrico Letta by withdrawing his party's support. But he backed down when it became clear that several of his PDL senators would support the government. </body>

      <title>Pakistan PM and Obama discuss drones</title>
      <description>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif meets President Barack Obama to press for an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new relationship.</description>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has met President Barack Obama in the White House to seek an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new post-Afghanistan war relationship. But correspondents say that few breakthroughs were expected on contentious issues on their agenda. The US was unlikely to offer any assurances on its secretive and controversial drone programme. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived two years ago. In May 2011 al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by US special forces at his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without the Pakistani government receiving prior warning from Washington. Relations were further strained by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. "We want to find ways for our countries to co-operate, even as we have differences on some issues, and we want to make sure that the trajectory of this relationship is a positive one,'' White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Mr Sharif said on Tuesday that drone strikes had "deeply disturbed and agitated" the Pakistani people and that his government was committed to bringing them to an end. "The use of drones is not only a violation of our territorial integrity but they are also detrimental to our efforts to eliminate terrorism from our country," he said. The prime minister said that the issue had become "a major irritant" in relations with the US. BBC Pakistan correspondent Shahzeb Jillani says that Mr Sharif is seen as adopting a populist stance largely meant for domestic consumption. Washington is unlikely to agree to any curtailment on its secretive and controversial drones programme, our correspondent says. Instead, President Obama will be more interested to hear from Mr Sharif the role Pakistan could play to ease his troubles in Afghanistan as the US prepares to pull out troops next year. Mr Sharif was expected to assure President Obama that his government is keen to ease regional tensions and live in peace with its neighbours, Afghanistan and India. He was also expected to look for Washington's help in reviving Pakistan's struggling economy and its growing energy crisis. In the end the two sides met with their own wish-lists, our correspondent says, but having experienced a low point two years ago, the meeting was likely about having realistic expectations from a complicated relationship. </body>

      <title>Tunisia declares mourning for police</title>
      <description>Tunisia's president declares three days of national mourning for eight officers killed by suspected militants in central Sidi Bouzidi province.</description>

      <body>Tunisia's president has announced three days of national mourning for eight officers killed by suspected militants in the central Sidi Bouzidi province. President Moncef Marzouki was speaking on the second anniversary of the country's first free elections. Earlier, PM Ali Larayedh confirmed the government would resign after talks with the opposition on appointing a caretaker administration were complete. The negotiations are aimed at ending months of political crisis in Tunisia. The prime minister said his moderate Islamist-led government was committed to the "principle of relinquishing power in line with the different phases envisaged in the roadmap". "We will not submit to anyone except the interests of the country," he said. His address came after thousands of anti-government protesters marched through the capital, Tunis, calling for the government to go. The political crisis was triggered by the assassination of two prominent opposition politicians earlier this year. The deadlock has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring. Earlier this month, the governing Ennahda party agreed to step aside in favour of a caretaker government, which would run the country until fresh elections are held. Ennahda and the opposition now have three weeks to appoint the interim cabinet. They also have one month to adopt a new constitution, electoral laws and set an election date. Since the 2011 revolt, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. The president paid his respects to the "souls of the martyrs who were martyred today" in a speech broadcast live on national TV. Members of the National Guard had surrounded a building in the village of Sidi Ali Bououn, following a tip-off that a suspicious group was hiding there, officials said. A fierce gun battle ensued during which both security forces and militants were killed. The president said the militants were responding "to the painful blow" on 17 October, when security forces killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who the authorities said had carried out a deadly attack on a police patrol. At least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of Tunis. The interior ministry blamed militants belonging to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group, who were linked to the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July. Their deaths triggered mass protests against the government. Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists - charges it strongly denies. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments over whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevin Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <title>Australia fire threat 'averted'</title>
      <description>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney has been "averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is not yet over.</description>

      <body>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney "has been averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is far from over. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said residents would be able to return to their homes. But he warned that fresh challenges lay ahead in the coming days amid unfavourable conditions. In total, 73 fires are burning across the state, 29 of which are uncontained. Meanwhile, a fire service investigation has concluded the largest of the fires in the Blue Mountains - State Mine near Lithgow - was caused by explosives training at an army range at Marrangaroo last Wednesday. Mr Fitzsimmons confirmed the cause of the fire was "on a live firing range as a result of the detonation of some ordnance", but he said: "Any suggestion that this practice would be on par with someone deliberately lighting fires, reckless or criminal, is outrageous". The defence department has not yet commented on the findings, but acknowledged at the weekend that it could have been the cause. The findings have angered Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill who said the army "should not have been firing" on such a hot, dry day. Hundreds of homes have already been destroyed as more than 3,000 firefighters battle to contain the bushfires in Australia's most populous state. Fire officials had warned that Wednesday's combination of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds could lead to more devastation. But fire chiefs confirmed by the end of the day that not one home had been lost. "If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today, to be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted," Mr Fitzsimmons said. Fire chiefs say a combination of back-burning - the controlled burning of areas with the aim of depriving a fire of fuel - building lines of containment and strategic planning had paid off. In particular, firefighters on Tuesday merged the State Mine fire with one at Mount Victoria to prevent them linking up with the third. "It is absolutely wonderful it did not run," Mr Fitzsimmons said. But he warned people to remain extremely vigilant. "There are still fires flaring up," he said. "There's every prospect we're going to see some more." Many schools in the Blue Mountains are expected to remain closed on Thursday. A major highway through the region is also closed. Emergency alerts remain in place near the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. An emergency alert in Springwood, to the west, has been downgraded to a watch-and-act alert. Earlier, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres linking bushfires to global warming and criticising his decision to repeal a tax on carbon emissions introduced by the previous government. "The official in question is talking through her hat," Mr Abbott told local media. "Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change - they're just a function of life in Australia." Mr Abbott, who took office in September, has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <body>A 14-year-old boy has been charged in the death of a teacher whose body was found in woodland behind her school. Philip Chism was ordered to be held without bail as he was arraigned in a Massachusetts state court for the murder of Colleen Ritzer. The 24-year-old, who taught maths at a high school in the town of Danvers, was found by searchers early on Wednesday. Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said she had been a "very respected, loved teacher". The accused has been charged as an adult and is scheduled to appear back in court on 22 November. All Danvers schools were closed on Wednesday. Officials said there was no reason to believe there were any other suspects. Mr Blodgett said investigators had found blood in a second-floor toilet at Danvers High School and soon located Ritzer, who lived in the nearby town of Andover. The suspect had also been reported missing after not returning from school. He was spotted by police walking along a road in neighbouring Topsfield at about 00:30 local time on Wednesday (04:30 GMT). Ritzer had a Twitter account where she gave homework assignments, encouraged students and described herself as a "math teacher often too excited about the topics I'm teaching". On Wednesday morning, students were shaken by the death. "We are all terrified," Caitlin McBride, a student at Danvers High School, told the Boston Globe. "It's very scary. No-one will ever look at this school the same way anymore." </body>

      <body>A Chinese newspaper has published a rare front-page plea for the release of one of its journalists held by police. The New Express, based in Guangzhou, called for Chen Yongzhou, who was detained last week, to be freed. The paper said Mr Chen's detention was linked to reports he wrote about a part state-owned construction equipment company based in Hunan. Police in Hunan have confirmed the journalist has been detained for "damage to business reputation''. Earlier this year, Mr Chen wrote several reports about Zoomlion, which is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government. Zoomlion issued a statement after one New Express article, which alleged it had improperly accounted for sales, caused its share price to drop. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange in late May, the company called the claims "false, groundless and misleading". The New Express led its article with a large three-character headline that read "Please Release Him". It said it had remained quiet so far because it feared Mr Chen, who was detained on 19 October, might be mistreated. "We always thought that as long as we report responsibly then there would be no problem; and even in the event of a problem, we can publish corrections and apologise; if it is really serious, and we lose a court case, we will pay or shut down if we have to," the editorial said. "But the fact is, we are too naive. Chen Yongzhou had spent three days and three nights [in custody] before he saw a lawyer," it added. Like all Chinese newspapers, the New Express comes under strict state control, but it has nonetheless gained a reputation for investigative journalism, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai. "We are a small newspaper, but we have the backbone no matter how poor we are," the paper said in its piece. Recent years have seen sporadic clashes between Chinese media outlets and the authorities. In January, journalists at the Guangdong-based Southern Weekly newspaper called for a propaganda chief to quit, after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute. The row sparked small protests and displays of solidarity from other media outlets before the issue was resolved. There have been strong reactions to the news of Chen Yongzhou's detention from users of weibo, China's version of Twitter. Around 30 lawyers have put forward their names to rally support for Mr Chen and organised a virtual body - "Observation Group on the Detention of New Express Reporter Chen Yongzhou". But the group have not said what they plan to do. Media professionals, including journalists, are also using weibo to join the call for police to release Mr Chen. An editor from Dongfang Jinbao, a Henan-based newspaper, wrote: "Support New Express to safeguard the rights of its journalists. The bottom line of consensus in today's society is rule of law. Why did the police arrest Mr Chen? On what legal basis? Is it detention or arrest?" Weibo users have also commented on the censorship of the news of Mr Chen's detention. Another journalist from Henan province added: Within 10 minutes, all major internet portals like Sina, Sohu, Tencent and others have withdrawn the story from their home pages. This is a moment of shame for all (except a few) journalists in China. Other users, however, are urging restraint, saying that it is not good to jump to any conclusions now. The appeal by the New Express comes as the administration led by President Xi Jinping takes a tough approach to press and internet freedom. China's 250,000 journalists and reporters are currently undertaking compulsory on-the-job training. Critics say its apparent aim is to make sure that journalists toe the party line. Some internet bloggers with large numbers of followers on weibo have been arrested for allegedly "spreading rumours". Other high-profile bloggers have stopped posting comments on sensitive issues, apparently fearing reprisals by the government. Rights group Reporters Without Borders has added Xi Jinping to a list of 39 leaders and groups identified as Predators of Freedom of Information in 2013. </body>

      <title>Dublin Roma girl returned to family</title>
      <description>DNA tests prove that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have proved that a seven-year-old girl taken from a Roma family in Dublin on Monday is their daughter. The family said they were "delighted" that their daughter had come home. They also said they would be taking legal advice, and that serious questions have arisen over the procedures used in the case. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl had been removed by police from her Tallaght home and taken into temporary care. The family have supported calls from human rights group Pavee Point for an independent inquiry into the investigation. In a statement issued through their solicitor the family said: "Her removal has been a cause of huge upset to her parents, her brothers and sisters, and the young girl herself. "They now intend to concentrate on looking after their family and, in particular, in trying to reassure their daughter that she will be left in their care. "Our clients also wish to say they do not believe that what has happened to their family over the few days should ever have happened. "They do not accept that this was any proper or sufficient basis to take their daughter away from them. "They believe that there are very serious questions arising about the procedures used in this case but are going to wait for things to settle down and consider their position and that of their daughter in light of recent events and will be taking legal advice in respect of this." A 21-year-old sister of the child, who can not be identified for legal reasons, said their mother had not eaten for three days because she was so distraught. "Everyone was very sad," she said. The sister added she hoped no other family would have to go through a similar ordeal. Meanwhile, a two-year-old boy from a Roma family who was briefly taken into care in County Westmeath has been reunited with his parents. The boy was taken from his family on Tuesday in Athlone and returned a day later. Alan Shatter, the Irish minister for justice, said he will be asking the Garda (Police) Commissioner for a report on the two cases. A Garda statement said: "Protecting vulnerable children is of paramount importance to An Garda Síochána and we continue to work in partnership with the HSE (Health Service Executive) and other agencies to ensure children's safety. "An Garda Síochána want to assure the community that we take extremely serious all reports received from members of the public concerning child welfare issues." The Irish police action took place against the background of international interest in the case of a blonde-haired child being taken from a Roma family in Greece last week. Greek police are investigating whether the girl had been abducted. </body>

      <body>South Korea's largest tobacco company has promised to change an advertising campaign after accusations of racism. Posters promoting a new line of cigarettes featured pictures of monkeys dressed as news reporters, declaring "Africa is coming!" The cigarettes are part of a new This Africa line. The company, KTandG, says they contain African tobacco roasted and dried in a traditional fashion. The cigarette packets contain images of monkeys roasting tobacco. "We are deeply offended by KTandG's shameless and insulting use of this mocking imagery," said the African Tobacco Control Alliance in a statement calling for the withdrawal of the ad campaign, saying it was "at a minimum culturally insensitive". It added: "Mocking Africa to sell a product that causes death and disease is unacceptable, and we will not stand for the exploitation of Africa by tobacco companies." The advertisements were displayed at convenience shops across the country. A KTandG company spokeswoman told news agency AFP it would pull the ads this month. She called the controversy "regrettable" and said the company wished to "dispel concerns of racism". "We absolutely had no intention to offend anyone and only chose monkeys because they are delightful animals that remind people of Africa," she said. "Since this product contains leaves produced by the traditional African style, we only tried to adopt images that symbolise the nature of Africa." However, she said the cigarette packet images would remain, as the company does not consider them to be offensive. </body>

      <body>French police say they have broken up a scam in which fake bottles of a top French wine were sold. They say the fraudsters netted up to 2m euros ($2.75m; £1.7m) from the scheme. Bottles of poor-quality wine were allegedly relabelled as Romanee-Conti, a Burgundy that is one of the world's finest and most expensive wines. Two Italian wine merchants have been arrested. They are suspected of selling 400 fake bottles - though it is feared many more may be on the market. French prosecutors say counterfeit labels were treated with wax to make them look older, and the result was so good that the bottles were near-perfect copies of the real thing. French police started an investigation after the vineyard said it had become aware of inferior copies being sold. Their investigation reached six European countries, including Britain and Italy. France has requested the extradition of the two Italians - a father and son - arrested in their home country. Several others have been arrested or questioned. Dijon prosecutor Marie-Christine Tarrare said: "Other suspects are being sought so that we can present this entire counterfeiting network in evidence." Romanee-Conti, like other Burgundy reds made from the pinot noir grape, is produced on a small estate of just 1.8 ha (four acres), making it highly exclusive. In 2011 a 12-bottle case of the 1990 vintage went for $297,000 (£183,000) at auction. </body>

      <description>Two officials in China are sacked after unauthorised restorers paint over ancient Buddhist temple frescos with cartoon-like figures from Taoist myths.</description>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey."

      <title>Democrats lament 'Obamacare' flaws</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies voice their frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law.</description>

      <body>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies have begun voicing frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law. House Democrats have complained that technical issues with an insurance enrolment website had overshadowed the law's current and future benefits. Some demanded Mr Obama find and sack those responsible for the glitches. Mr Obama has said technical problems with the site are "unacceptable" and pledges they will soon be fixed. He assured Americans on Monday that technical experts from both inside and outside the government were working around the clock to fix the website and its underpinnings. The health law, known formally as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and is Mr Obama's foremost domestic policy initiative. Among its central provisions are an expansion of the Medicaid public health programme for poor people, a requirement that Americans who do not have insurance from their employers or the government buy it on their own - with subsidies to aid the purchase, and a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. Mr Obama and the law's supporters say it will eventually reshape America's costly and inefficient healthcare industry and provide insurance to most of the estimated 46 million Americans who lack it. At issue currently are websites run by the federal government and some states that serve as online marketplaces where individuals can compare private insurance plans, learn about available public subsidies, and sign up for a plan. The sites, known as exchanges, opened on 1 October. The White House aims to enrol as many as seven million people through the exchanges by the 31 March end of the enrolment period. The central site run by the federal government, healthcare.gov, has been plagued with problems, notably extremely long wait times. Websites run by individual states have not performed as poorly. The Republicans, who have opposed the law from the beginning and have sought to undermine it at every turn, are now calling for the rollout to be delayed and for deadlines for enrolment to be pushed back. The Republicans have also loudly demanded an investigation into the exchanges' shortcomings. "It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable," House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday. Complaints from Mr Obama's fellow Democrats are a relatively new part of the debate. Democratic members of the House of Representatives left a briefing provided by the administration on Wednesday saying they had resolved not to let the problems with one part of the rollout overwhelm the law's benefits. "The president needs to man up, find out who was responsible, and fire them," Minnesota Congressman Richard Nolan said. "You don't get many second chances to get a good first impression." The White House has sought to reassure political allies and Americans at large that the government is working to resolve the issues. The Obama administration has launched what senior officials called a "tech surge," with senior economic aide Jeffrey Zients tasked with analysing and repairing the problems. On Wednesday, executives from top health insurance companies agreed to form new technical teams to help the Obama administration fix the website and the systems underlying it. "We are collaborating closely with the insurers to address problems we have witnessed," the White House said in a statement, after executives from 14 insurance companies met Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration officials. </body>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif and US President Barack Obama have discussed the US drone strikes in Pakistan, with Mr Sharif saying they must end. The two leaders held wide-ranging talks at the White House on Wednesday, pledging to strengthen the often-strained ties between the nations. Mr Sharif said Pakistan would continue to operate with "maximum restraint" as a nuclear state. Mr Obama said the two nations remained important strategic partners. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago, when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without the Pakistani government receiving prior warning. Relations were further tested by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. On Wednesday following the Oval Office meeting, Mr Obama acknowledged that tensions and misunderstandings would persist between the two nations. "It's a challenge. It's not easy," he said. "We committed to working together and making sure that rather than this being a source of tension between our two countries, it can be a source of strength." And he pledged co-operation in "ways that respect Pakistan's sovereignty, that respect the concerns of both countries". Mr Sharif said the two had agreed to strengthen co-operation on counterterrorism. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," he said. He stated his top priorities were the global economy, energy, education and combating extremist activity. He said Pakistan hoped to join multilateral export regimes in order to promote long-term economic growth. Mr Obama said both leaders had agreed on the importance of leaving Pakistan's neighbour Afghanistan "stable and secure" as US and coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year. The White House said a stable and peaceful Pakistan-Afghanistan border was critical to a successful counterterrorism and counterinsurgency effort. Both leaders "expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum achieved in defence relations", the White House said in a statement. They also pledged to abide by the commitments of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Korea, emphasising that nuclear terrorism was "one of the most challenging threats to international security," the White House said. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>
      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>The widows of three Chilean soldiers have launched legal action against the country's Communist Party leader. The Communists' president, Guillermo Teillier admitted his party approved an armed operation targeting the late General Augusto Pinochet in 1986. Five troops escorting the leader died and 11 were injured in the ambush. Around 3,000 people disappeared or died in Chile between 1973 and 1990 and 30,000 are believed to have been tortured by the authorities. In an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in April, Mr Teillier said his party had approved the failed attempt against Gen Pinochet's life and other armed operations in the 1980s. It was "nothing more than a reaction" to what the government had been doing against the Communist leadership, Mr Teillier said. The women taking legal action say they want him jailed for the deaths. "We want justice and equality before the law, that's all we want," one of the widows told Chilean Radio Bio Bio. The recent 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup headed by Gen Pinochet re-ignited nationwide debate about responsibilities and punishment for crimes committed during the period of military rule. The daughters of an ally of the deposed leader Salvador Allende, former President Michelle Bachelet, and of a Pinochet assistant, Evelyn Matthei, are pitted against each other in next months presidential elections, which has heightened the country's political sensitivity further. </body>

      <body>At least two UN peacekeepers have been killed and six others wounded in a suicide attack in northern Mali, UN spokesman Olivier Salgado has said. A bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle to the checkpoint in Tessalit town before blowing himself up, he added. A local official told Reuters news agency that two civilians, including a baby, had also been killed. The UN has nearly 6,000 troops in Mali to tackle militant Islamists. Its special representative to Mali, Bert Koenders, earlier this month called for more troops to be deployed following an upsurge in bombings and rocket attacks. French troops captured northern Mali's key cities and towns from the militants after launching an operation to oust them in January. It handed security responsibility to the UN force in July. The force, known as Minusma, has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel. The two peacekeepers who were killed in the attack were from Chad, Mr Salgado said. "The provisional toll is two dead and six injured," he added. A government official in Tessalit, Cheick Fantamady Bouare, said four people had been killed in total, including a child, Reuters reports. </body>

      <title>British links to al-Shabab revealed</title>
      <description>A list of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Somali militants al-Shabab - and related organisations - is compiled by the BBC.</description>

      <body>The names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to al-Shabab - and related organisations - have been established by the BBC. Most of those on the list travelled to Somalia to fight or attempted to do so. Somali-based militants al-Shabab carried out the deadly attack on the Westgate mall in neighbouring Kenya. Lawyers for the family of one British recruit known to have died in Somalia are investigating whether he was killed in a raid involving western military. Al-Shabab is fighting to impose a brutal version of Islamic law on the country and the group is linked to al-Qaeda. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad, and further first-hand research and accounts. It is not a complete list of people from the UK who are suspected of having gone to fight because it is impossible to establish or estimate with any certainty how many Westerners have taken up arms in Somalia. The research found that security chiefs believe at least 32 of the identifiable individuals went to fight. A further seven were named in British court cases as having attempted to enter Somalia, but their plans were discovered and disrupted. Others have been accused or convicted of raising money for al-Shabab, or facilitating the travel of others. Seven people on the list returned to the UK - but the fate of most of the others is completely unknown. Four of the men on the list are known to be dead, including men who featured on a video released by the group a week ago. The video included a message from a young man named as "Talha", who asked Muslims in Tower Hamlets - a borough in east London - to join the jihad in Somalia. Talha, whose real name was Taufail Ahmed, died in Somalia in November 2012. The Foreign Office said it had confirmed the death to his family, who are of Bangladeshi origin. He grew up in Stepney Green in east London. The BBC has tracked down people who knew him at school. They say he fell into a life of gang crime before leaving that world behind in favour of an extreme interpretation of Islam, before disappearing from the UK. "For British Muslims he's doing a disservice," said one former schoolmate. "For Muslims around the world, he is doing a disservice." In the al-Shabab video, the narrator says that "Talha" died after an attack involving American and British forces. The government has not commented on that claim but his family has asked the legal charity Reprieve to investigate. "The family were notified by British police officers. The FCO [Foreign Office] have knowledge of the incident and have told us that Taufail Ahmed received a Muslim burial," said Kat Craig from Reprieve. "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." </body>

      <body>Large crowds in the Indonesian province of Yogyakarta have seen the daughter of Sultan Hamengkubuwono X conclude three days of marriage celebrations. Over 750 guests, including Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, attended the wedding. Gusti Ratu Kanjeng Hayu, 29, married Kanjeng Pangeran Haryo Notonegoro, 39, whom she has dated for 10 years. Large crowds of people turned out to greet royal horse-drawn carriages which carried the couple to the royal palace. The wedding celebration was streamed live on the internet. The bride and groom went to the same high school as one another, but 10 years apart. Later they met at a school reunion and got romantically involved when they were in the US. The couple will follow a royal tradition of monogamy embraced by the bride's father. Previously Sultans practised polygamy, but Hamengkubuwono X has just one wife. Born in 1948, Hamengkubuwono X is not only the monarch but also is the governor of Yogyakarta, one of the few remaining kingdoms in Indonesia. He was elected by local MPs in 1998. But the central government in Jakarta wants to introduce changes whereby the governor will be directly elected by voters. As a monarch he only has ceremonial powers. The proposed move has been strongly opposed by the Sultan and local people in Yogyakarta. </body>

Four fishermen searching for crabs discovered the wreckage last week. It took two days to salvage the plane from the river. A US scholar says the plane was a B-25 bomber from the "Flying Tiger" squadrons, a special unit of US military pilots tasked with training Chinese pilots in air combat. The undercarriage, engine and fuselage were all brought to the surface, still bearing the "North American Aviation" engraving and with a plate inscribed with the serial number and date of manufacture - 15 February 1943. The US scholar, identified in Chinese media as Patrick Lucas - a descendant of a US air force pilot - identified the plane from photographs as a B-25 bomber. Mr Lucas was said to have travelled to the region six years ago to try to find evidence of the crash site but was unsuccessful. The Flying Tigers came out of a clandestine operation authorised by then-US President Franklin Roosevelt to train Chinese pilots. The American Flying Volunteers, as they were officially called, began their training over Burma in 1941 with 43 fighter planes and 84 pilots; by the end of the war they had been incorporated into a regular US air force unit of more than 700 planes, fighting against Japanese forces over Burma and China. One of the fishermen to discover the wreckage, Ma Jinbin, told the Anhui Business News newspaper that their nets frequently snagged underwater at the crash site, leading them to investigate the cause. </body>

      <title>Synthetic drugs site 'biggest in EU'</title>
      <description>Police in Belgium uncover what is said to be the biggest synthetic drugs production site in the EU - in an old pig shed - and make five arrests.</description>

      <body>Police in Belgium have uncovered what is said to be the biggest synthetic drugs production site in the EU, inside an old pig shed, making five arrests. They swooped on the site near the north-eastern town of Opglabbeek, close to the Dutch border, Europe's police intelligence agency Europol said. Four Dutchmen and one Belgian man were arrested on suspicion of belonging to an organised crime group. Shortly after the raid, a suspicious fire broke out in the shed. The site was reportedly equipped to produce several hundred kilos of ecstasy a week. Spread over 1,000 sq m (10,764 sq ft), it contained high volume custom-made equipment, Europol said. Police seized and removed 35 tonnes of chemicals, finding materials and products valued at around 3m euros (£2.5m; $4.1m). Europol described it in a press release as the "largest synthetic drugs production site ever found in the EU". However, in August, synthetic drugs were found at a laboratory in southern Belgium with a street value of 1.3bn euros, according to Belgian prosecutors. Europol could not be reached for comment on Wednesday afternoon. "With a street value of between 2,250 to 6,000 euros per kilo, MDMA [ecstasy] produced from this laboratory is likely to have resulted in several million euros of turnover each month during active production," Europol said after the new find. The raid took place on Friday but was only reported by Europol on Wednesday. In the early hours of Monday, a suspicious fire broke out in the pig shed, destroying equipment which had not been removed by police. "The fire was so huge that the exact cause cannot yet be confirmed. However, due to the suspicious circumstances, police cannot rule out that it may have been a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence," Europol said. The laboratory found in August was discovered in a rural area near Chimay. Nine men and two women, aged 30 to 50, were arrested and charged with possessing, manufacturing and trafficking drugs. The suspects, from Belgium, Turkey and Poland, were part of an international criminal group, police said. Europol supported Belgian authorities with intelligence analysis during the latest operation and Europol experts helped dismantle the laboratory. "Large-scale MDMA production is back in the EU and we will make it a priority to identify the organised criminal structures responsible," Michael Rauschenbach, Europol's head of serious and organised crime, said on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>The international police body Interpol has called on member states to make their national databases of missing people available. The appeal is a further attempt to identify a young blonde girl named Maria, who was found in a Roma camp in Greece last week. A search on Interpol's worldwide database proved unsuccessful. Interpol has also requested that the DNA profile be taken of anyone claiming to be a relative and sent to Interpol. "We took the DNA profile received from the Greek authorities and we compared it to our database. And there was no match," the secretary general of Interpol, Ronald Noble, told AFP news agency. He said he was hopeful that the huge publicity the case had received worldwide might help find some of her relatives. "A DNA profile can be taken by the police anywhere in the world, sent to Interpol and compared to the profile sent to us by the Greek authorities," Mr Noble said. Those countries which do not have national DNA databases are also being encouraged to add all their DNA records of missing children to Interpol's database. On Tuesday the Roma couple, identified by Greek police as Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, were formally charged with abduction and remanded in custody pending their trial. They insist that the girl was given to them legitimately. The case has sparked concern among the parents of missing children around the world. Greek authorities are investigating whether the girl may have been a victim of child trafficking. Criminal organisations bring hundreds of children from the Balkans to Greece, where they are subjected to forced labour, sex-trafficking or sold to couples - in Greece or abroad - in illegal adoption schemes. </body>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <body>A 15-year-old Yemeni girl was burned to death by her father for getting in touch with her fiance before their wedding, police say. The 35-year-old man was arrested after the teenager's death in the remote village of Shabaa, in Taiz province. "The father committed this heinous crime on the pretext that his daughter had been keeping in contact with her fiance," a police statement claimed. Local news websites said he had caught the pair chatting on the telephone. Traditional tribal customs in some parts of Yemen prohibit contact between men and women before marriage. Last year, the UN Human Rights council raised concerns about so-called "honour killings" in the country. Perpetrators were not charged with murder, and faced only a six-month to one-year prison sentence, it found. Accorded a low status in the family and community, many Yemeni women are subjected to various forms of violence, deprivation of education, early and forced marriages, sexual abuse, restrictions over freedom of movement, forced pregnancy, and female genital mutilation. Last month, there was an outcry after an eight-year-old girl reportedly died of internal bleeding on the night she wed a 40-year-old man. </body>

      <title>Union may back Ineos survival plan</title>
      <description>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos.</description>

      <body>The union representing workers at Grangemouth's petrochemical plant could be set to agree to the "survival plan" set out by majority owner Ineos. About half the workforce at the complex had rejected new terms and conditions proposed by Ineos, prompting the firm to announce the plant's closure. Subject to agreement by the workforce, Unite may now accept the changes in a "last-ditch effort" to keep it open. The union is to present its proposals to Ineos at a meeting on Thursday. It remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that the company would reverse its decision. However, the company had said while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Previously, Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond spoke again to management and unions to try and seek further resolution. He also convened an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers to discuss the on-going situation. Afterwards he said there was still room for negotiation between both parties, particularly since Unite had put forward fresh proposals to the company. Mr Salmond said: "We should give time for the proper consideration of this offer, especially given that we know an agreement between both sides was very close last week, and the prize is a viable future for Grangemouth. "However, given that the current position is the one we always feared possible given the stalemate between the sides, if an agreement between Ineos and Unite is not possible then we will continue to pursue our contingency options of finding a buyer for the site." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - met in London to discuss this issue. Mr Carmichael told BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme that Mr Davey had a 40-minute "positive" talk with Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. </body>

      <title>ECB outlines bank healthchecks</title>

      <body>Bank shares across Europe have fallen after details of planned healthchecks on the top lenders were unveiled. The European Central Bank, which takes over supervision of leading eurozone banks next year, said the stress tests would unearth potential risks. Banks with capital shortfalls may be required to bolster their balance sheets, the ECB said. The Euro Stoxx index of big eurozone banks was down more than 2.5% in late morning trading. ECB president Mario Draghi said: "A single comprehensive assessment, uniformly applied to all significant banks, accounting for about 85% of the euro area banking system, is an important step forward for Europe and for the future of the euro area economy. "We expect that this assessment will strengthen private sector confidence in the soundness of euro area banks and in the quality of their balance sheets," he said. The exercise will start next month, and will take about 12 months. The ECB said the aim was to "foster transparency, to repair and to build confidence". Berenberg Bank senior economist Christian Schulz said: "The exercise will increase transparency, trigger further balance sheet repair and restore confidence in the eurozone banking sector. "A successful exercise could complete the process of healing after the Lehman and eurozone crises." A provisional list of banks to be reviewed includes 24 German banks, 16 in Spain, 15 in Italy, 13 in France, seven in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and four each in Greece, Cyprus and Portugal. About 128 banks will eventually be scrutinised to ensure their stability and highlight potential risks to the financial system. An asset quality review will look at "sovereign and institutional holdings and corporate and retail exposures, and both the banking and trading books will be reviewed", the ECB said. Another part of the review will look at liquidity, leverage and funding. Thirdly, the banks will be stress-tested against various scenarios to ensure their resilience to sudden shocks in the banking system. Banks will be required to hold a capital buffer of 8%. When assessing banks' capital, the ECB said it would use the European Banking Authority's definition, which classifies bank loans that are more than 90 days overdue as non-performing. Italian bank shares were hit, and Spain's Bankia fell more than 5%. Germany's Commerzbank was down 3%. The ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will cover 24 banks that make up about 65% of the German banking sector. Bundesbank deputy president Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the process "will be a tour de force for German banks and their supervisors", but added that "the effort will be worthwhile, as the SSM will give us the opportunity of getting the best out of all supervisory cultures in the euro area". </body>

      <body>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has said its drug sales in China during the July-to-September quarter sank 61% after it was hit by a bribery scandal. Andrew Witty, chief executive at GSK, said it was too early to predict when the business might recover. But he added there was "absolutely no question" of the company pulling out of China. The pharmaceutical giant allegedly used travel companies to channel 3bn yuan (£300m) to bribe doctors and officials. GSK admitted some of its executives in China broke the law when Chinese authorities took four GSK employees into custody in connection with the allegations earlier this year. "We continue to co-operate with the authorities and we remain fully committed to supplying our products to patients in the country," the company said in a statement. "At this stage, it is still too early for us to quantify the longer-term impact of the investigation on our performance in China." The investigation into GSK, which is one of Beijing's largest into a foreign company, started in July and also includes other pharmaceutical companies. The drop in sales was bigger than many analysts predicted and hit the company's pre-tax profit - which fell 6% to £1.4bn. Mr Witty said the business had suffered most where there had been options from other drug companies. However, GSK predicted its sales growth for the year would be about 1%. The multinational company, which makes Panadol, Sensodyne and Aquafresh among other things, sees China as an important market for future growth. It has a research centre, 7,000 staff and five factories based in the country, although at the moment less than 4% of its sales are generated there. </body>

      <body>Boeing has announced plans to raise production of its 787 Dreamliner to 12 per month by 2016. That would be an increase from its target for the end of this year of 10 planes a month. The Dreamliner has experienced major problems since its introduction two years ago. It was grounded in January of this year for more than three months while investigators examined why batteries were catching fire. Boeing also reported an 11% rise in net earnings to $1.16 billion dollars for the three months to the end of September. That was better than analysts were expecting and Boeing shares rose more than 4%. The strong performance was partly due to its commercial aircraft division where sales rose 15%. Sales at its defence, space and security business rose just 3% and sales of military aircraft fell during the quarter. "Despite the uncertainty of the US defence market, overall our customer focused business strategies and disciplined execution on our programmes are producing the results we expect," said Boeing's chief executive, Jim McNerney. </body>

      <description>Manchester United move a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad.</description>

      <body>Manchester United moved a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad. Inigo Martinez's second-minute own goal - which also owed much to superb work by Wayne Rooney - ensured United maintained their unbeaten record in the competition this season. United manager David Moyes will have made three points his sole objective after the disappointing 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton on Saturday and in a week when their European campaign has been reduced to a sideshow by revelations in former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's new autobiography. And on the night when United gave a trial to Old Trafford's new 'singing section',  they at least had something to celebrate - unlike the 6,000 colourful visiting fans who followed Sociedad. The La Liga side made United work hard for the win but it was one they fully deserved despite some anxious moments, particularly when Antoine Griezmann hit the post with a first-half free-kick. Rooney was once again United's main source of danger as he continued the outstanding form he has shown this season. If there are any complaints from Moyes, they will have centre on his side's inability to finish the game off earlier - as well as some questionable defending that offered Sociedad hope. And at least Moyes was finally able to move the agenda away from his predecessor Ferguson, who has claimed the headlines this week and overshadowed this important Champions League game as he raked over his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford. Once again, this was not a fluent United performance but the result will give them added confidence ahead the return meeting away to Sociedad in a fortnight. Moyes decided against risking striker Robin van Persie, who has been suffering with toe and groin injuries - but Rooney's irresistible form meant the Netherlands international was not missed early on as United were ahead inside two minutes. Rooney demonstrated perfect technique and speed of thought to evade three defenders in the area, only to curl a shot against the post with keeper Claudio Bravo beaten. As Sociedad appeared to have survived, Martinez sliced the rebound hopelessly into his own net. Sociedad had a valid claim for Javier Hernandez being offside as Martinez did his unwitting work but Dutch referee Bas Nijhuis and his officials were unmoved by the complaints. Rooney was at the heart of everything early on and almost added a second after 12 minutes - but Bravo was equal to his volley from Rafael's cross. From hesitant early beginnings, Sociedad grew in confidence into the game and were desperately unlucky not to equalise before half-time. David De Gea had already saved athletically from Haris Seferovic but he could do nothing to stop Griezmann's free-kick and was relieved as it bounced away off the woodwork. Sociedad continued to improve after the break but United were creating chances as Phil Jones saw his header blocked by Bravo and Antonio Valencia's low, angled shot struck the post. Fortunately for United, Sociedad had lost the impetus they gather in the early moments of the second half and did not make United pay for those missed chances. Manchester United boss David Moyes: "Yes [I was frustrated] because we had it on Saturday in a Premier League game when we lost a late goal. If we had scored five or six today it wouldn't would have looked out of place. "I'm concerned we gave away couple of free kicks on the edge of the box. But Wayne Rooney was absolutely terrific tonight, I was shouting at him in the last five minutes though. "We just want a top player like Wayne to play well. I said from day one that his training was great. I think England have seen that. But we need to see it all the time." </body>

      <title>Holloway departs as Palace boss</title>
      <description>Ian Holloway leaves his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent after less than a year in charge.</description>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace by mutual consent  after less than a year in charge at Selhurst Park. Holloway, 50, guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, but had won only one league game this term. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. "Ian felt that a new approach might help keep us in the division," chairman Steve Parish said.  "It's a completely different challenge for Ian and a completely different challenge for us at the club. "Ian's been very noble and he's come forward and said: 'I can't do it.' I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it." Assistant manager Keith Millen will take temporary charge  for the game against Arsenal on Saturday. Although the club lost star player Wilfried Zaha to Manchester United, Holloway was allowed to bring in 16 players during the summer. "I have pride in the job we've both done," Holloway said. "We need to shut up shop in this division. At the minute we've got a whole new group there. "I have to hold my hand up and say we didn't keep the spirit that got us up. "We changed too much too quickly." He added: "This club needs an impetus of energy - but I just feel tired to be honest. I'm worn out." Palace won 3-1 against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August, but they have lost their seven other league games this season. Palace are 19th in the Premier League table and speculation had surrounded Holloway's position following a meeting with Parish after the Fulham defeat, despite the chairman telling BBC Radio 5 Live before the game his job was secure. Parish said he would consult Holloway when it came to appointing a new manager and that the club needed someone with more top-flight experience. "We've got a whole group of people who are only really used to the Championship and dropped them into the Premier League," added Parish. "I think we both realised we need someone with more experience at this level." Holloway ended a three-year spell at Blackpool - who he guided to promotion to the Premier League in 2010 before being relegated back to the Championship the following season - to join the Eagles, succeeding Dougie Freedman. Palace were fourth in the Championship table when Holloway arrived, but held onto a play-off place thanks to an 89th-minute winner from Mile Jedinak in the final game of the season against Peterborough. After beating Brighton in the play-off semi-finals, an extra-time Kevin Phillips penalty secured promotion against Watford at Wembley. </body>

Robshaw opted to rest rather than tour Argentina with Lancaster's squad. But he has been reinstated as skipper for the autumn internationals against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand after holding off Tom Wood's claims. Head coach Lancaster said: "It was the right thing to do. The pressures of captaining club and country are big." He added: "When I looked at him and spoke to him at the end of last season, while he was willing to go on tour, I felt a physical and mental break was important for him. And he's come back refreshed, to take on the role again. "We spoke about the end of the season, to give him some areas to develop. One was his foot speed over the floor, and his ability to change his pace. "He's worked on those. Harlequins have done a good job and he looks in great shape. To have a big back row in the modern game is handy, so he's got physicality as well, but I think he's a bit more dynamic as well." Robshaw had been omitted from the British and Ireland Lions squad that secured a historic series win down under, and then had to watch as Wood captained England to win in their own series in Argentina. But Lancaster feels that process has left him in a better position as Australia come to town. The coach said: "It obviously hurt him. But it happened at a time when he had the opportunity to get away from rugby. To be able to get abroad, get some sun on his back, reflect on what he'd done over the last 12 months… I think he came back having put it to bed and moved on. "He's had to fight to get in the England side, and he knows nothing will be taken for granted. And he's had disappointments in the past, and fought back from them." Lancaster will finalise his team for Australia's visit to Twickenham on 2 November after training next Tuesday, although it seems certain that Billy Vunipola will win a first start at eight. The coach was also fulsome in his praise for Northampton scrum-half Lee Dickson, which suggests Ben Youngs might not be guaranteed the starting role at nine. "Everyone has to be playing at the top of their game to get picked," he said. "We could have lads who have been away on Lions tours wondering now if they're going to get picked." Neither was Robshaw given any assurances about the captaincy when he opted to miss the summer tour. But Lancaster made it clear that, once he came through the weekend's games unscathed, the Harlequins flanker was his clear favourite to resume the role. "I gave him the assurance that if he was playing well enough he'd get picked, and then I'd make the captaincy decision after that," revealed Lancaster. "But experience matures players and captains. It'll help him deal with the on-field situations you face as captain. "You've talked about Tom captaining the side - the two times he did it in Argentina are the only times he's done it. It's a big ask to then ask someone to make all those on-field decisions and to get them right, to get a feel for the game as well as concentrate on your own game. It's a different skill. "When you're captaining England, there's a bigger role to play than just purely the on-field decision making. Chris's experience in doing it over the last 12 months will help him - it's a case he's had more time doing it and he'll be better this time around. "If you put together the likes of Geoff Parling, who obviously went on the Lions tour and took the leadership role, Tom Wood, who's captained England, Dylan Hartley, who captains his club, and Lee Dickson's captained his club, Toby Flood's captaining his club… we've got players in there with a range of experiences, and that's what you need in a team." Robshaw, however, is guaranteed little beyond this autumn. Lancaster insists his skipper has the role only for the next three games, not least because of the young open-sides who are expected to push the incumbent hard. The 27-year-old has sometimes been denigrated as a 'six and a half' rather than a specialist open-side, although his coach believes some of that criticism should be borne by those around him. "An open-side's game is dependent on the team," said Lancaster. "The priority is to make sure the team plays well, because if the team plays well, then open-sides tend to play well. "We have young players who are more in that (specialist) sort of mould - Matt Kvesic, obviously, Will Fraser, Luke Wallace - but we need a little bit more consistency from them in order to justify picking one of them ahead of someone like Chris." </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24621448</url>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>Counter-terrorism saga Homeland has been renewed for another season by US cable channel Showtime, as has 1960s-set drama Masters of Sex. The fourth season of Homeland and the second of Masters of Sex will both comprise 12 episodes and air in 2014. The shows are aired on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday and Tuesday respectively. The most recent instalment of Homeland was watched by 1.97 million, while Tuesday's episode of Masters of Sex attracted 848,000 viewers. The overnight figures are down on the ratings achieved by the shows' debut episodes on 6 and 8 October respectively. Homeland, starring Claire Danes as troubled CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was watched by 3.31 million viewers when it returned to UK screens earlier this month. And the opening episode of Masters of Sex, which stars Britain's Michael Sheen as pioneering sex expert Dr William Masters, drew an audience of 1.43 million two days later. In the US, both shows are broadcast back-to-back on a Sunday night, with the most recent edition of the terrorism drama attracting 1.8 million viewers and Sheen's drama watched by 1.4 million. "Homeland continues to prove its strength for Showtime, and is one of television's most exciting, provocative and widely-discussed shows," David Nevins, president of entertainment at the network, said. "The critical and audience reaction to Masters of Sex since its great launch has been incredibly gratifying. It's a privilege to get to work with such talented and creative people as [Homeland creator] Alex Gansa and [Masters of Sex's] Michelle Ashford, as well as their tremendous casts. "They have each created truly original shows, with distinctive voices that are among the most admired series on television." </body>

      <title>Roma cases raise children concerns</title>
      <description>Fears that Roma children cases may resurrect 'old myths'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24635560</url>

      <body>The high-profile cases of two young girls in Greece and Ireland have highlighted the treatment of children in Roma communities across Europe. DNA tests conducted in central Greece on a blonde-haired girl known as Maria have shown that the couple looking after her were not her biological parents. Tests were also carried out on a girl taken into care in Dublin, although they have concluded that she was living with her biological parents. Police had initially not been persuaded by the birth certificate and passport provided by the family, reports said. Both stories, one on the western fringes of Europe and the other in the east, involve blonde-haired girls with disputed documents. "Not all Roma communities have dark skin: there are Roma who have light skin and green eyes," says Dezideriu Gergely, head of the Budapest-based European Roma Rights Centre. He is concerned about the dangers of racial profiling and insists Maria's case in Greece should be viewed as unusual. While it is not uncommon for children to be raised by extended families, for example by grandparents, Mr Gergely considers it rare for children to be brought up beyond their biological families. "Definitely there is a need for an answer. Something was not right and that is for the court to investigate." What alarms him is the labelling of an entire community. There has been widespread interest in Maria, particularly because of the high-profile disappearances of two British blonde-haired children: Madeleine McCann in Portugal in 2007 and Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. Indeed, the authorities have themselves internationalised the story with Interpol asking 190 countries to check for a possible match to Maria's DNA, to assess whether she has been a victim of child abduction or trafficking. Mr Gergely believes the latest cases may resurrect old hatreds and myths of babies being stolen. Roma in already-marginalised communities such as Serbia have complained of racial discrimination. But he does acknowledge that the Roma may have been exposed to child traffickers. "It's true the Roma are a vulnerable group because of extreme poverty, low income and low levels of education. But it's not related to cultural factors or to do with the Roma community, let's say, getting involved in trafficking." The UN children's agency Unicef has told the BBC that Roma communities are often used by traffickers because they are seen as "under the radar of society". As many as 3,000 children in Greece are in the hands of child-trafficking rings originating in Bulgaria, Romania and other Balkan countries, Unicef says. Most cases are not thought to involve abduction but rather the buying and selling of children for a few thousand euros. Part of the problem in Greece appears to lie in its localised and out-of-date child-registration system. And yet, ever since the mid-1990s, the European Union has tried to ensure all Roma communities across Europe are fully registered. Most Roma, some 95%, are in settled communities in the EU and both Maria's case and that of the girl in the Tallaght suburb of Dublin involve settled families. In other words, there is no obvious need for paperwork problems. But for all the efforts to bring Roma families into national databases, many are still clearly beyond the system. The couple who registered Maria, according to the Greek authorities, used false identification and claimed to have had six children in under 10 months. And Greece's supreme court has called for an urgent investigation across the country into birth certificates issued since 2008. The prosecutor's order warns that Maria's case may not be unique. "This could have happened in other parts of the country," it warns. In Ireland, too, there are concerns about the registration system, which have alarmed Siobhan Curran, Roma project co-ordinator at the Pavee Point travellers and Roma centre. She has seen many in Ireland's 5,000 Roma population struggle to get hold of social benefits because of what she sees as "very harsh criteria" needed to meet what is known as the habitual residence condition. Poor literacy and language can also be a problem for Roma looking for a job when they try to register for the Personal Public Service number (PPS), required for tax purposes. She describes a vicious cycle where families are unable to obtain a medical card because they are unable to prove they are entitled to one. When they fail to take a child to a local doctor for care, social services are then called in. "Social workers have contacted us with very serious child protection concerns. They have told us in some cases they have very little option but to take a child into care to give them access to services." Although Ireland historically has been known for its traveller community, many Roma arrived only in recent years looking for a better life when countries such as Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic entered the EU. Europe's total Roma population is thought to be as high as 10-12 million, with Turkey having an estimated population of 2.75 million and Romania with some 1.85 million. Siobhan Curran warns against sensationalising the Roma issue. "Any child protection case has to be taken seriously," she says. "But we need to challenge the starting point that there's a connection between Roma and child trafficking." </body>

But the signs are that Washington's most important strategic Arab partnership is now suffering the biggest strains since it emerged that 15 of the 19 suicide hijackers who had attacked the US on 9/11 were Saudis. First came the shock announcement on 18 October that Saudi Arabia was turning down its two-year non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in protest at the international body's apparent inability to resolve either the Syrian or Palestinian situations. Then on Tuesday it was widely reported that the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, had told European diplomats his country would be making "a major shift" in its relations with the US. Largely in protest over Washington's reluctance to get involved militarily in Syria, the prince reportedly said Saudi Arabia would be scaling back its co-operation with the CIA over arming and training Syria's Sunni rebels. On the same day, another senior Saudi royal, Prince Turki al-Faisal - the former intelligence chief and ex-ambassador to the US and UK - gave a speech in Washington damning President Barack Obama's policies on Syria as "lamentable". He dismissed the US-Russian deal to dispose of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile as a trick to excuse Mr Obama from having to order military action there. Yet at the very same time, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, was sitting comfortably next to his US counterpart, John Kerry, first in Paris on Friday and then on Tuesday in London as they worked on finding a political solution to the Syrian conflict. US diplomats say they have received no formal notification of a change in relations and that US-Saudi co-operation is solid and will continue. So what is really going on? Firstly, Prince Bandar has a reputation of being somewhat at the megaphone end of Saudi communications. Despite spending 22 years as Riyadh's ambassador in Washington, he has a penchant for making overly dramatic gestures and statements that in the past have led to his exclusion from the inner circle of Saudi policy making. It is not clear whether his words carried the full backing of King Abdullah, now nearly 90 years old, who retains ultimate authority. But one senior diplomat in Riyadh remarked: "The words may not be the king's, but the sentiment is the same: the Saudis are seriously upset with Washington, they feel they are not being listened to." The other Saudi royal who spoke out, Prince Turki al-Faisal, may be the brother of the foreign minister but he does not speak officially for the government. However, his words are closely listened to in Western capitals. Yet beyond the statements and signals, the Saudis do have a growing list of complaints and differences in their relationship with Washington, which are as follows: But none of these Saudi complaints is likely to herald an end to a profound security pact that has already endured such challenges as the 1973 Arab oil embargo and the fallout from the 9/11 attacks. Saudi-US cooperation in counter-terrorism runs deep, with the CIA and FBI providing much of the technical expertise that has helped Saudi Arabia largely eliminate its al-Qaeda problem or drive its members over the border into Yemen. The powerful Interior Minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, will be in no hurry to see that co-operation jeopardised. </body>

      <title>Captain Collette, a woman on the front line</title>
      <description>What is it like being a woman in charge on the frontline?</description>

      <body>Capt Ashley Collette was the only woman in her platoon of soldiers on the Afghan front line - and she was in charge. In the Canadian armed forces, unusually, every job is open to women - and both sexes live together and fight together. On the first day that Capt Ashley Collette and her platoon of 60 men were deployed in the remote town of Nakhonay, near Kandahar, they came under attack. "I don't think that the enemy liked our presence," she says with a soldier's understatement. "It's kind of in the middle of where they want to be." That first day set the pattern for the next few months. Twice a day, Six Platoon - part of Bravo Company in the First Royal Canadian Regiment - endured enemy fire, both on patrol and directly on the camp. It was so regular that the soldiers nicknamed it "contact o'clock". But Collette says being shot at made a sort of sense to her troops - they could see the bullets lighting up the sky and mountains as they came towards them. It was the IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and - towards the end of their rotation - suicide bombs, that wore on their nerves. On 21 June, Sgt Jimmy MacNeil, an engineer attached to the platoon, was killed by a bomb while on a foot patrol. He was a kind, popular soldier, and a close friend of Collette's. The hours following his death were frantically busy and it wasn't till later in the day that she got a chance to reflect. Then she went and sat by herself on a sandbank in the camp. "We still had six months to go," she says. "I remember thinking 'How am I, one, going to hold it together myself, and two, going to hold together this group of 60 people who are devastated by this event?'" Then, two of her men came and sat next to her, one on either side. Neither said anything - and she knew that she didn't need to say anything, that they understood how she felt. Collette did hold it together. After returning from her tour, she was awarded the Medal of Military Valour, one of Canada's highest military honours, for her leadership in Afghanistan. (She is keen to attribute the accolade to the work of her whole platoon.) Around 12% of soldiers serving in the Canadian army are women and they have been integrated into combat positions since 1989. The US and Brazil are currently in the process of working out the best way to place women in combat roles. The UK, which has not yet taken this step, will review its policy in the next five years. Those who argue against putting women into combat sometimes say that a woman would not be able to carry a wounded fellow from the battlefield. Collette says she was tested every year in "soldier carry" and "soldier drag" exercises. Although she was paired with someone of a similar weight to herself, lifting bigger people using the "fireman's carry" is not as hard as you might think when you know how. A priority in any infantry unit is to develop team cohesion. The traditional way to do this is to train, eat and sleep as a unit. But when Canadian female soldiers were first placed on the front line, they were segregated from the men. It didn't work. Now they are mixed in together, and sleep in the same dorm. This does present some logistical challenges, but Collette took pains to be modest. While the men slept in boxer shorts, she would wear pyjamas. While training in Canada, she would climb into a cupboard to change, or pull her sleeping bag around her and change underneath. "Normally this would be a successful endeavour," she says wryly, before going on to describe a sleeping bag malfunction in which somehow the thing slipped from her grasp and she was left standing in electric blue knickers and bra. Someone shouted "Look at Ashley!" and all the men turned to laugh. "I laugh with them because what can you do? I pull the sleeping bag up and change my clothes and everyone carries on, because you have way bigger things to worry about." In Afghanistan, she shared a room roughly 3m x 4.5m (10ft by 15ft) with up to 10 people. But if anybody needed privacy they would just ask for it. When you share a small space with a group of men for a length of time, they become like your brothers, she says. When men from other units came to her platoon and made the mistake of commenting on her appearance, her own soldiers cut them down. "Soldiers from my platoon would look at those attachment soldiers and say, 'That's really irrelevant in this scenario. Keep your comments to yourself - that's our platoon commander.'" After her return from Afghanistan, some of her men approached her with a confession. "They said, 'In the beginning we were wary of you, but now we would follow you anywhere,'" she says. But then, she believes it's natural for soldiers to be wary of a new commander, regardless of the gender. "They always want to feel out your style of leadership." She describes her own style as compassionate - "I believe in second chances" - and perhaps a little more democratic than some, prepared to listen even to the lowest ranks. But she quickly adds that she is authoritative when she needs to be. A particular concern to her before her rotation was how she would be received by the Afghan village community - whether her sex would prevent her from establishing vital links with local leaders. "I thought that they wouldn't even listen to me, I thought that they would poke fun at me," she says. "But they didn't care at all." And this was in Panjwaii district, the Taliban's birthplace. She was very popular with the village children, especially the girls, who would run after her with gifts of jewellery - but Collette says this was because she was kind, not because she was a woman. Although the village chiefs accepted the fact of Collette's gender, their wives were incredulous. After she had been in Nakhonay for about a month she was summoned to have tea with them and was quizzed about everything from what she liked best about Afghanistan to when she was going to settle down with a nice Muslim boy. The occasion was made even more surreal by the fact that her interpreter was not permitted in the room because he was male. Consequently, they were forced to make small talk at the top of their voices, so they could be heard through the walls. Since her deployment, Collette has married and is currently taking a break from active service to complete an MA in social work. But she has every intention of returning to uniform, as a mental health specialist. She is passionate that people see her as a soldier, rather than a "woman soldier" and describes the whole debate about whether women can handle a combat job as "null and void". "In my experience," she says, "there's no reason why a band of brothers cannot be a band of brothers and sisters." Capt Ashley Collette was interviewed in Women on the Front Line on the BBC World Service. Read more features from the 100 Women season. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>In graphics - who is seeking asylum in Europe?</description>

      <body>Syria's brutal civil war is pushing a new wave of migrants towards Europe. Their numbers have surged, but many asylum seekers in Europe have also fled the conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. European governments are struggling to co-ordinate their response to the influx. Large movements of migrants from country to country quickly fuel suspicions that some politicians are trying to shift the burden onto their neighbours. Greece and Italy - major entry points for migrants - say there must be more burden-sharing in the EU, especially as they have been hit hard by the eurozone crisis. Migrants continue to board overcrowded, rickety boats, risking their lives. The recent deaths of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean highlighted their plight. Asylum is granted to those who say they are fleeing persecution and who can convince the authorities that they would face harm or even death if they were to be sent back. Nearly a quarter of asylum applications in the EU are handled by Germany. France is the second biggest destination for asylum seekers. But often English-speaking migrants head for the UK, which is home to large communities from Pakistan, Somalia and Middle Eastern countries. Among the asylum seekers from Russia there are many Chechens, whose homeland was devastated by war between separatist rebels and Russian troops. The asylum seekers from Serbia include many Roma and ethnic Albanians, who complain of discrimination in Serbia. In the developed world the US is the top destination for asylum seekers, but Germany and France are second and third. Sweden, with a much smaller population, is fourth, ahead of the UK. But it is important to remember that developing countries host more than 80% of the world's refugees. People fleeing conflict or persecution often end up in a neighbouring country - but many do not want to settle there permanently. Pakistan, with 1.6 million refugees, ranks highest for sheltering refugees. The vast majority of Afghan refugees are in Pakistan and Iran. Globally Europe is the main place where asylum claims are processed. For many asylum seekers Europe is easier to reach overland or by boat, especially those fleeing conflicts in the Middle East or Africa. And people traffickers already have well-established smuggling routes to Europe. The figures illustrate why immigration has become such a hot topic in Europe. Globally Afghanistan ranks first in terms of asylum seekers' country of origin. But the war in Syria has pushed that country into second place. China and Pakistan are also major countries of origin. Both countries have anti-government minorities and dissidents who allege discrimination or persecution. </body>

      <title>The four sisters who took on Botswana's chiefs</title>
      <description>Four Botswana sisters who gained the right to inherit property</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24623692</url>

      <body>In many countries across Africa, the right of the firstborn male, or closest male relative, to inherit family property - is still standard practice. Women are denied the right to inherit the family estate purely because of their gender, a custom that is upheld by some traditional leaders. But four sisters in Botswana did something that no-one there thought was possible - they took on tradition and won. Last month, a five-year legal struggle ended with a landmark victory to Edith Mmusi (80) and her three sisters Bakhani Moima (83), Jane Lekoko (77), and Mercy Ntsehkisang (68). Inside her modest home in a village in Kanye, a small town south of the capital Gaborone, Ms Mmusi has a wry smile as she speaks of the lengthy case. "It took resilience and courage to get this far. It was a stressful time for the family that gave me many sleepless nights. I am glad it is finally over," she says. This is the family's ancestral home - a compound of some eight concrete houses in various sizes, built on the Ramantele family plot. Over the years it was sub-dived to accommodate members of the family who wanted to live close to the elders. The house at the centre of the row was built on the land where Ms Mmusi's old family home once stood. What remains of that house is a wall of mud, bricks and mortar, the only reminder of the house Ms Mmusi and her sisters had lived in with their parents as young girls. "This is the only home we've known here. We helped to build one of the first mud houses in this big yard," she tells me, a big smile on her face. It is easy to see that this place means a lot to them, as they share their childhood memories of growing up here. When their father died, Ms Mmusi and her sisters contributed to the upkeep of the homestead and looked after their mother until her death in 1988. In court the sisters argued that they were entitled to the family home as they had used their own finances to renovate the property. The Appeals Court agreed, finding that denying them this right went against the constitution. But this was not an easy victory. Traditional values are held in high regard here, as in many rural areas in Africa. Tswana custom prescribes that the family home is inherited either by the first-born or last-born son, depending on the community. As a result, their nephew had earlier won the case at the Customary Court of Appeal which found that under his ethnic group's customs, women could not inherit the family home. That court had ordered that Edith and her sisters be evicted from the family home. As a last-ditch attempt to avoid eviction, the sisters took the matter to the High Court and later the Appeals Court, which both ruled in the women's favour. But this has been a bitter-sweet time for the family, and the matter has caused divisions in the family. Some male members feel the women belittled their culture by challenging it, Ms Mmusi tells me. Something she says she hopes will change with time. "Customs and culture have no place in the modern world because women are still oppressed in the name of culture." "What makes men [especially the staunch traditionalists] think they have power over us? We are all equal in God's eyes," she adds, the smile now gone. But why are some people against women inheriting the family home? In its broadest sense, traditionalists argue that the only way of preserving family wealth is by passing on the inheritance only to the males, arguing that women may take that wealth to another family after they marry. But African cultural expert Moses Twala, of the Kara Heritage Institute, believes this ruling should compel traditional leaders to take a closer look at what they are doing. "Culture is not static, culture is dynamic because it conforms to the times, especially with the fact that people are getting more and more modernised with the times," he says. He says inheritance should not be seen as something that will benefit one person, but rather as something that will see to the wellbeing of the entire family once the head of that home has died. He argues that women are as capable of carrying that responsibility as males. "A family is not one person only who is a male. Females also play a very big role also in uniting the very same family even when males are present," he told the BBC. But Botswana is largely a conservative country. While a handful of chiefs in Botswana are for promoting gender equality, they say this should be done in a manner that still shows respect to age-old traditions. "Yes culture is dynamic but tradition is important, the role of tradition is to preserve our identity. We would like to preserve our culture and live in the way that our great-grandfathers lived," says Chief Gaseintswe Malope II. As head of the Bangwaketse people, the third biggest community in Botswana, he says it is his responsibility to make sure his people honour their traditions. Modern law and African culture are in many instances still poles apart and sometimes in direct contradiction, according to women right's activists. Women's Inheritance Now, a group advocating the inheritance rights of women, believes the judgment will go a long way to bring change to Botswana. Back in Kanye, Ms Mmusi is hopeful that the case will inspire other women to stand up for what they believe in. "It will give them motivation and comfort that they are not the only ones going through that, where they are. We hope they will say: 'These women took action and they won' and do the same too. We are overjoyed," she says. </body>

      <title>Maid to entrepreneur: Rising out of poverty in Brazil</title>

      <body>Lucineide do Nascimento has come a long way from her birthplace near Natal in the poor north-east of Brazil. Had things gone according to her father's plans, she would have been married as a teenager and followed a traditional rural lifestyle - living off produce grown on the family farm. But she decided to move south and live a different life. "I was a rebel and went against my parents' wishes," says Ms Nascimento, now aged 44. She is a small entrepreneur - and her story illustrates the recent social change that has transformed the lives of millions of people in Brazil - many of them women. Her journey was not easy. She left her family home at 17, moved to Rio de Janeiro and became a maid, a popular job among poor Brazilian women who have little education. She says she faced prejudice and was so naive she thought she did not have the right to be paid a regular salary because she lived in her employer's home. Ms Nascimento soon grew tired of the job and its uncertainties. She moved to the vast sprawling city of Sao Paulo, where she sold domestic supplies. By then, she was already thinking of ways of fulfilling her dream of having a business of her own. It was 2007, and eco-friendly products were all the rage in Brazil. Ms Nascimento spotted her opportunity. She rang the local Greenpeace office to ask what would be the best material for replacing plastic supermarket bags. "And it turned out to be raw cotton, which was precisely one of the things we used grow on my family farm up north," she recalls. She started crafting the bags at home, after a full day working as a saleswoman, and sold them to other small companies. Her business grew steadily, and today she makes about 10,000 bags per month, employing four people in her small factory in Sao Paulo - including her husband and older son. Her family in the north-east used to think of her as the "black sheep", she recalls. Now she is their pride and joy, as well as a role model for the whole family. "We are a big, humble family of seven siblings. Growing up, we didn't even have electric power. My father was worried about us moving to big cities, he wanted me to marry young and lead a quiet rural life. "But my parents always trusted me, so I thought it was my responsibility to grow in life," she says. "Back then, there was little education in my family; their only plans for the future was to have children of their own. "But I kept telling them that it was important to get an education. Now they all live in the city and many are starting university." With Ms Nascimento's help, her sister's small business selling home-cooked meals has turned into a fully fledged churrascaria - a traditional Brazilian meat restaurant. Ms Nascimento's experience is becoming more common in Brazil, a developing nation where the gap between rich and poor has been narrowing. The changes have been particularly marked for Brazilian women. Falling birth rates mean mothers have smaller families to care for and often do better in their chosen professions. According to Sebrae, a body that promotes entrepreneurship, the number of Brazilian women who became business owners grew by 21% in the past decade, at twice the rate of men. Still, gender inequality persists in the Brazilian labour market. According to official figures, the average Brazilian woman makes almost 30% less money than her male colleague. Ms Nascimento plans to triple her sales in the next few years at her business, Edilu Eco-bags. "Women still face some prejudice, but it's changing. And it's up to us to break the cycle," she says. And her concerns are now those of a typical urban Brazilian woman. "I've learned to delegate tasks to my husband and kids, they help me with the company and with the dishes and handle their own school work. "Now I want to make more time for girly things, for chatting with my girlfriends. I've learned that life is more than work and family!" </body>

      <description>Mapping sexual harassment in Indian cities</description>

      <body>"I was going to my college at Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad. I got down from the bus and was walking forward... Suddenly a few men were coming from the front, and two of them walked by my side really close and one of them pinched my breast..." This entry from the southern Indian city is one of the hundreds on safecity.in - a website created just days after last December's gang rape of a student in Delhi, to improve reporting and recording of sexual harassment and crimes against women. The website offers an interactive map of the most unsafe places across Indian cities. The Hyderabad entry continues: "I was shocked... I couldn't talk to anyone. I did not report it to the police as I could not see the face of the person who pinched me. There have been similar incidents in this area." In India, sexual assault of women occurs every three minutes and data from the government's National Crime Records Bureau suggests that a woman is raped every 20 minutes. And these are crimes that have been reported to the police and are registered officially. Thousands of incidents like the one at Dilsukhnagar are never registered and do not get into the crime records - something that safecity.in wants to change. Founded by Surya Velamuri, Else Disilva, Saloni Malhotra and Aditya - a group of four young professional men and women - the website has created a "crowd-sourced" map of sexual harassment, covering safe and unsafe places across India. And anyone, from anywhere in the world, can report an incident of sexual abuse on safecity. "As women in the group, we asked ourselves what is it that has troubled us in various ways all through these years," says Surya Velamuri. "Our aim was to customise it to Indian behaviour so we included categories like cat-calling, touching and groping, sexual invites, indecent exposure, et cetera." Since its inception last year, safecity.in has received more than 962 reports of sexual abuse from across India with the capital, Delhi, recording the maximum number of complaints with 781. And the numbers are consistently growing. "The map on our site can help in many ways. If you are a woman travelling to a new city, a look at the map will instantly tell you about the safe and unsafe locations," Ms Velamuri says. "Also, if we see lots of reports coming from a specific area in a city, it can actually help the police and administration nail the possible reasons that make it unsafe, like poor lighting, insufficient patrolling or the presence of rogue elements," she adds. What makes the website popular with its women users is the anonymity they enjoy. "We realised that women in India are usually scared and [too] shy to report sexual abuse. They do not like their names and identities to be revealed, but here you can post as an anonymous user." But that creates a problem of a different kind. As most women visitors to the site do not leave their names or contact details, it makes it difficult to verify the reports, says Ms Velamuri. Safecity has recently joined hands with Goa police and any user willing to make a formal complaint in the Goa region can disclose their identity to the police and get their case registered. Ms Velamuri says the group is working on more such tie-ups with police in other cities and towns. The group at present is working on a project to map the 100 most unsafe places in the capital, Delhi, and its surrounding areas. A team of volunteers is collecting - and plans to upload - more than 100,000 reports of sexual crimes from Delhi residents. The next step, Ms Velamuri says, will be to take up these reports with the police and local authorities. Success, however, is still far away. In a country of 1.2 billion people, India has only 130 million internet users and with limited internet penetration in rural India, safecity.in has a long way to go before it can map every corner of the country. </body>

      <title>US survivors recall 1983 Beirut bombing</title>
      <description>The bombing of US marine base in Beirut, 30 years on</description>

      <body>On 23 October 1983, bombs exploded in Beirut, killing 241 US service members and 58 French paratroopers. Survivors describe what happened on that day - and afterwards. The multinational force of American, French, British and Italian soldiers was deployed to Lebanon following the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps by militiamen. Their mission: to back the Lebanese Armed Forces and help them establish and maintain sovereignty over war-torn Beirut. The operation was intended to be brief. But in April 1983, the US embassy in Beirut was destroyed, and the situation for the multinational force deteriorated from there. Then the US marines and the French paratroops were attacked - in two separate suicide bombings, occurring at about the same time. Soon afterwards US troops and other members of the multinational force pulled out of Lebanon. And the survivors of the attacks tried to get on with their lives. I woke up and got dressed, brushed my teeth, shaved and started to listen to some music on my walkman. A half hour later I heard a loud explosion. I got out of my bunker and saw a huge plume of smoke. And then I heard people yelling that they hit the battalion. I saw caravans of trucks and marines racing towards the battalion. I was in Beirut until November. I had nightmares, anger - and pulled away. To this day my dad, mom, brother, wife and children don't know what I saw. I was on watch, manning communications. I was relieved from my post and returned to my bunk. I lay down to sleep and the next thing I knew I awoke under two huge concrete pillars. They were lodged on top of me. I was able to escape, and I stumbled around. Everywhere you looked, there were parts of the building or a dead marine or a body part. The building was gone, reduced to a smouldering pile of rubble about 60ft (18m) high. I saw marines burned by battery acid, which had drained on to victims who were pinned with no way to escape. I heard faint voices and cries out to God for help. There was an awful smell in the air, and I could taste dirt and grit inside my mouth. The experience has caused me great pain and anguish over the years and even today it continues to be an ever-present part of me. We had rigging to hang mosquito nets, which we also used to air out our uniforms and to dry out our towels. That saved me from blast wounds as the shards of glass and fractured concrete whirled about. In my underwear I picked my way through the debris to the operations centre, located down a narrow hall in the main building. Wires hung, dangling like wet spaghetti. I spied my deputy struggling up the hill with a badly bleeding marine on his back. I asked him where he was going. He replied that he was taking the marine to the aid station at the Marine Service Support Group because the battalion aid station and all the battalion medical staff were buried in the basement. A fine grey powder of pulverised cement covered everything. It reminded me of a scene of the volcanic eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington three years before - debris and body parts, covered by the fine dust. Off to one side I spied what I first thought to be a ragged tree stump - until I noticed blood oozing from the stump. It was a human leg. Nearby, the lid of an ammunition box was impaled up in a palm tree. Ahead I could see the media waiting. What could I say? I didn't know what the answers were myself. I organised my teams to take groups of newsmen and photographers around the rubble, letting them document the 40ft-wide crater. I live with what happened in Beirut almost every day. But I am determined to let the world know that the bombing did not defeat us. We are still here. I thought, "What... was that?" To this day I can smell it, and I can hear the screams for help, I can feel the dust upon my skin. I can feel the reverberations and the concussion in my body from the explosion - and the ringing in my ears. I feel guilty that I lived through it. Now I stay in my "bunker" at home, a trailer where I have been living since 2001. I am at peace in my own little world - me and my two dogs. A wise veteran once said for those who died the war is over. For the rest of us it is only a nightmare away. Reported and written by Alasdair Soussi </body>
