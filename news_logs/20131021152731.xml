      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Jersey 'last home of Neanderthals'</title>
      <description>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of Neanderthal history is published.</description>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Uganda seizes massive ivory haul</title>
      <description>Some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory is seized in Uganda - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years, officials say.</description>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Nobel winner Higgs plans to retire</title>
      <description>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, promises to retire - once he turns 85.</description>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why the chancellor wants China to invest in UK nuclear</title>
      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away after 14 caravans moved onto the 300-space area. Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on. He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result. But one hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said it was "infuriating". "Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing," the worker said. "I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. "There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. "They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp." Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: "Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. "It just shouldn't be allowed to happen. "It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. "I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon." Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately 65 spaces. "We will ensure that security is available on site from 6am-10pm every day to reassure and support staff," he said. "We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible - there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible. "There has been no disruption to hospital services and, in the main, staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning." </body>

      <title>Enterprise zone jobs 'in pipeline'</title>
      <description>The first minister says there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones, as he also announces 100 new jobs in the Cardiff zone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24607690</url>
      <date>1382360083</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70612000/png/_70612440_vlcsnap-2013-10-21-13h43m13s126.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The first minister has said there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones. Carwyn Jones' comments came as he announced accountancy firm Deloitte will create 100 jobs in the Cardiff zone over the next three years. He also announced a cut in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Welsh Conservatives say the enterprise zones still have "a long way to go". At his monthly press conference, the first minister defended his Welsh government's enterprise zone policy saying they "are the envy of the rest of the UK". There are seven enterprise zones in Wales, each dedicated to nurture specific industries. Companies have access to a range of benefits, including business rate relief, enhanced capital allowances, skills support, superfast broadband, bespoke infrastructure projects and simplified planning rules. Carwyn Jones said almost 2,000 jobs have been created across the seven zones, with a further 6,500 planned, 3,000 of them in the Cardiff zone. Located in the centre of the capital, a further 100 jobs are set to be created in the zone dedicated to financial services as financial advisory firm Deloitte's is set to expand. Deloitte will set up the Cardiff Centre of Excellence to support its International Assignment Services, helping employers meet tax compliance. The Welsh government has invested £170,000 into the project, which will centralise client administration and support. Carwyn Jones welcomed the news at the firm's Cardiff headquarters. "This latest expansion which is set to create 100 jobs in Cardiff sends out a strong message that Wales is becoming the location of choice for companies operating in the professional and financial services sector that are looking to grow their business," he said. "I am hugely encouraged that Cardiff has been selected and confident this latest project will build on the success of their quality and risk operations team in Cardiff. "Wales is the first place in the UK with an enterprise zone dedicated to this sector and Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone is helping to enhance the city's position as a capital location for professional business services." Shadow Minister for Business Nick Ramsay AM, said: "This is extremely welcome news - and long overdue. "Progress on the Labour government's enterprise zone in Cardiff has been disappointingly slow - and today's announcement is a step in the right direction. "In the two years since this zone's announcement, very little has been announced and very few details released. "There is a long way to go on every enterprise zone in Wales and I am pleased that some progress is finally being made." The first minister also announced SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment bank. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to look at the bank's interest rates more widely. Eluned Parrott AM, said: "This announcement will be welcomed by small and medium sized businesses planning on investing in Enterprise Zones, however, questions still have to be answered as to why Finance Wales's interest rates are higher than they need to be across the country. "I do hope that the Welsh Government will look seriously at the interest rates it is offering through Finance Wales across the country, and take action to ensure that its rates are comparable with the market not unnecessarily expensive for companies who are trying to create wealth and encourage growth." The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the announcement raises some questions. FSB Welsh Policy Unit chair Janet Jones said: "The announcement of a 2% cut in rates from Finance Wales for businesses in Welsh enterprise zones is welcome, but rather perplexing. "The Welsh government's own report into access to finance by Professor Dylan Jones-Evans noted that Finance Wales' interest rates were often well above their regulatory requirements. "FSB Wales agrees with that assessment, and this announcement suggests that there is more flexibility in Finance Wales' setting of its interest rates than was previously stated. "In the light of this announcement we would call for Finance Wales to re-examine its rates as it appears that state aid rules do not require rates to be as high as they are at present," she added. </body>

      <body>A Cardiff man accused of posting a string of terrorist publications on Facebook has been remanded in custody at the Old Bailey in London. Khuram Shazad Iqbal, 20, is accused of publishing the inflammatory material between 1 January and 16 September this year. He is also alleged to have had 10 copies of Al Qaeda magazine Inspire on his computer when arrested in October. Mr Iqbal appeared in court via video link. He faces charges in relation to offences connected to publishing material to incite terrorism and possessing a record containing information useful to terrorism. Prosecutor Mark Topping said: "This is a preliminary hearing of a matter sent for trial on October 10 by Westminster magistrates, following the defendant's arrest." It is alleged Mr Iqbal provided a service for others to obtain, read, listen or look at terrorist publications on a Facebook page. The files, under the name Abu Irhaab, were available for sale or as loans or gifts, it is alleged. Mr Iqbal appeared in court via videolink wearing a white head cap and light coloured top with a long black beard and spectacles. He spoke only to confirm his name during the 15 minute hearing. Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned the case until 17 February next year for a plea and case management hearing. A provisional trial date was set for 24 March next year. </body>

      <body>Heavy rain forecast for the whole of Wales this week could lead to more flooding, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has warned. Downpours and high winds led to problems in parts of Pembrokeshire and Powys on Monday morning. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service reported "severe" flooding in Haverfordwest. NRW said further floods are possible in the coming days in areas where the ground becomes saturated. In Carmarthen a flood warning was issued for the River Hydfron at Llanddowror, near St Clears, but the situation there was reported to be improving by lunchtime on Monday. A spokesperson for NRW said: "The river Hydfron at Llanddowror has peaked and is expected to continue to fall over the next four to five hours." Flood alerts remain on a number of other rivers with warnings and alerts updated on the NRW website every 15 minutes. In Neath Port Talbot the fire service is diverting flood water away from properties, although no one has been evacuated. One crew from Mid and West Fire and Rescue Service were called to Heol y Felin in Seven Sisters just after 12:00 BST. A spokesman for Pembrokeshire council said the number of calls regarding flooding there had eased by mid morning. Some roads in the Llandrindod Wells area of Powys were also affected by flood water. Rail services between Birmingham International station and Aberystwyth were delayed at Machynlleth due to earlier flooding. A 'be aware' yellow warning of heavy rain was issued across the whole of south Wales earlier on Monday. Areas covered by the warning included Swansea, Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot, Vale of Glamorgan, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Cardiff, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil. The heavy rain had eased around mid morning but more heavy rain is likely later, and a further warning could be issued. NRW said the areas likely to be worst affected on Tuesday would be across south Wales and the Snowdonia mountain range in Gwynedd. A spokesperson said further spells of "particularly heavy showers" were likely later in the week, which would lead to the ground becoming saturated. Fallen leaves could also block drains and cause flooding on road services, the spokesperson added. On Saturday flash floods hit many areas of Cardiff including Pentrebane, Llandaff, Roath, Cathays and northern parts of the city. Police were forced to close roads in Ely and Culverhouse Cross as localised flooding made conditions treacherous. </body>

      <body>A rugby club has paid tribute to a former player who has died after a collision with a car in south Wales. Mark Williams, 48, was walking with his partner at the time of the incident on Friday at 23:45 BST on the A4054 near his home in Rhydyfelin, Pontypridd. Police have spoken to the driver of a Fiat Punto and are appealing for witnesses to come forward. Rhydyfelin RFC said Mr Williams was "a true legend, friend and gentleman" in a tribute on the club website. Mr Williams was with his partner Joanne when the collision happened at the junction of Cardiff Road with Janet Street. The father-of-two was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff but died from his injuries. The former painter and decorator's family paid tribute to him and said in a statement: "We are all heartbroken and we will cherish the all the great times and wonderful memories Mark gave us. "Mark had many friends in the area and was always ready to go out of his way to offer a helping hand. "He spent most of his life in the area where he was very popular and will be missed by a lot of the community and his friends at Rhydyfelin rugby club." The club published a tribute on its website, saying: "The whole of Rhydyfelin are saddened by the loss of Mark 'Pinman' Williams, a talented full back who blessed the club with his speed and skill on the field, and his multi talented artwork is installed in many houses throughout the village. "All our prayers go out to Mark's family at this sad time - rest in peace Pinman, a true legend, friend and gentleman." The club cancelled all its games on Saturday following the news. The family statement said that Mr Williams had been Wales cross country champion at the age of 14 and had played rugby for Wales at under-21 level. Witnesses to the collision have been asked to call the police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <title>Join forces for cheaper energy call</title>
      <description>People are being encouraged to join forces to get a better deal on their gas and electricity through a scheme being launched across Wales.</description>

      <body>People are being encouraged to join forces to get a better deal on their gas and electricity through a scheme being launched across Wales. Households club together and effectively hold an auction with energy suppliers to see which firm offers the lowest price. It is hoped the collective buying of energy will see household bills fall by hundreds of pounds a year. A similar scheme was set up in Cornwall a year ago. The Welsh version, Cyd Cymru or Wales Together, has been developed by Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan councils with support from other local authorities and housing associations around Wales. They hope to change the way energy is bought, simplify what they say is a complex tariff system and aim to address the issue of rising fuel prices as winter approaches. "Collective energy buying schemes mean consumers can band together to negotiate with energy suppliers to get the best rate on the market for consumers," said Ashley Govier, Cardiff council's cabinet member for environment. "The more people that get involved, the greater the potential to gain a better deal. "This is a genuine opportunity to steer a way through the turmoil of price rises and multitude of tariff options from the main companies." A similar scheme was piloted last year in Cornwall which helped people in fuel poverty to save money on their bills. Its project manager Matt Hastings, from the Eden Project, told BBC Radio Wales around 10% of Cornish households signed-up, but there were mixed levels of engagement from the energy industry. He said: "I think we are at the beginning of the end in terms of the existing large oligopoly of the energy market. "There is a massive transference going on towards community energy and in two to three years I think we're really going to to see that come through." Last week, British Gas announced it was increasing prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November - meaning an average annual rise of £123. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. It follows rival SSE previously announcing an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On Monday morning, Npower became the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. Prime Minister David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal while Energy Minister Ed Davey described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. The Vale of Glamorgan's cabinet member for environment, Rob Curtis, said Cyd Cymru was a better option than going it alone. He added: "Shopping around for the best energy deal takes time so Cyd Cymru is the ideal solution for busy families." Energy Saving Trust Wales said it was no surprise many households were concerned about paying energy bills. In Cornwall, the Cornwall Together initiative had 7,000 households sign up within a month of launching in October last year. Switchers are saving an average of £133 on their energy bills. Matt Hastings, founder of Cornwall Together, said: "Despite the savings claimed from Cornwall Together's first round, £750,000 of savings still went unclaimed from people who signed up but didn't switch." </body>

      <body>Conservative MP Alun Cairns has secured a debate in Parliament later to discuss the future of the BBC. It will give MPs an opportunity to reflect on recent issues including cultural working practices, pensions and management of the organisation. The Vale of Glamorgan MP is expected to say there are clear lessons that can be learnt from recent experiences. Mr Cairns will raise concerns over almost £5m spent on three BBC inquiries into the Jimmy Savile scandal. He has been campaigning for greater transparency of the BBC's finances. The Welsh Tory backbencher introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill last November that called for all invoices in excess of £500 to be published. He has also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest when BBC journalists act for private companies outside their BBC responsibilities. MPs will discuss the issues in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon. "I want the debate in Parliament to be about the future of the BBC," said Mr Cairns. "The public will be aware of a number of different recent scandals and issues and I think it is right that the future of the corporation is considered in parliament. "It is important that taxpayers are aware of how their money, the licence fee, is being spent. "Every local authority in England publishes every invoice over £500 - I think it would be reasonable for the BBC to do the same. For too long the BBC have resisted freedom of information calls and public scrutiny is essential. "I hope this is the start of a positive debate into the future of the BBC and how it learns its lessons." On Friday the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, called for BBC Wales to be made accountable to the Welsh assembly. </body>

      <body>Close family, friends and colleagues of the former Football Association of Wales (FAW) president Tegwyn Evans have attended his funeral. Mr Evans, 85, of Welshpool, Powys, died on 8 October, a week after suffering a heart attack. Officials from the FAW attended the funeral service which was held in Welshpool on Monday. A minute's silence was observed for Mr Evans ahead of Wales' World Cup game against Macedonia on 11 October. Mr Evans was described as "passionate" about football, serving as an FAW council member since 1975 and as president from 2003 to 2006. He was also a former mayor of Welshpool, a president of the local football club and a successful businessman. The FAW has said Mr Evans, who was chairman of the Central Wales FA, was a "lifelong stalwart of mid Wales football". Following his death, it said: "During his time at the FAW he was a fine ambassador for the game at home and abroad and made many friends. "Everyone at the FAW salutes his service to football in Wales and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time." Away from football, Mr Evans was heavily involved in his local community and was widely known as "Mr Welshpool". He served on Welshpool Town Council for many years, including a spell as mayor between 1981 and 1983. In 2002, he was awarded the MBE for his services to the town and to Welshpool Football Club. </body>

      <body>Councillors have met in Carmarthenshire to discuss ways to cut £30m from the authority's budget. Local businesses were invited to the meeting in Y Ffwrnes, Llanelli, to view 60 possible options for how the savings can be achieved. The authority has already warned hundreds of jobs could go. Last week the Welsh government announced Carmarthenshire council's budget for next year will be cut by 3.9%. Ahead of the meeting, council leader councillor Kevin Madge, said: "Monday's event is probably one of the most important events I will have taken part in during my 30 years as a councillor. "This event is just the start of a three-month process for determining our budget for next year which will include an extensive public consultation." Mr Madge said there would be a series of local events for the public who will be encouraged to give their views by post, email or via a consultation section on the council website which will be launched in a few weeks' time. "We will also be seeking the views of representative groups such as the Citizens Panel, the 50+ Forum, Youth Forum and Carmarthenshire Disability Coalition," he added. "We will be urging as many people as possible to give us their views as this is a critical time for local government and the decisions we make now will have a long lasting effect for many years to come." </body>

      <body>Bristol's British and Irish Cup game at Aberavon was abandoned after 69 minutes after a deep hole appeared on the Talbot Athletic pitch. The visitors were leading 24-20 when the referee halted the game. The ground staff spent 10 minutes trying to fill the hole, which Bristol described as six-feet deep,  but it was deemed unsafe to continue play. The organising committee will decide whether Bristol's bonus-point victory will stand or be replayed. The decision is likely to be announced later this week. Bristol team manager John Harrison told BBC Radio Bristol: "The referee had his attention drawn to what he thought was a divot, which transpired to be a hole which we think was going to some sort of drainage channel. "The fire brigade provided turf and soil to fill it in but we were concerned for the safety of the players. "The referee's decision in this competition is final and he decided to abandon the game. As far as the result is concerned, that has to go to the organising committee." Bristol beat Leeds 21-17 in their opening pool match last weekend, while Aberavon secured a 31-17 victory over Gala. </body>

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

The alarm was raised by a member of the public after the 15-20ft (5-6m) sailing vessel overturned close to the shore between Aberdyfi and Tywyn. The four managed to get ashore safely after an unsuccessful attempt to rescue them by lifeboat. They were flown to Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth as a precaution by an RAF rescue helicopter from Anglesey. Milford Haven coastguard said the four people, who were wearing life jackets, were assessed on the shore by Aberdyfi coastguard team and it was decided they should attend hospital. The coastguard said the four and their boat were caught in the surf, making a lifeboat rescue difficult. The boat is now being recovered. </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock £2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <body>Dean Keates scored his second goal in two games as Wrexham beat struggling Woking in the Conference Premier. Keates received the ball from Jay Harris's short corner and his cross into the area deceived everyone to beat Sam Beasant. Woking rallied in the second half with Mike Cestor's header striking the crossbar and Andy Coughlin denying Scott Rendell. Joe Clarke sealed the win in the final minute with a composed finish. Victory extended Wrexham's unbeaten run to three games but Woking remain in the Conference Premier's bottom four. Wrexham player-manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales: "With all the problems we've had with centre-backs and the week we've had, to have a clean-sheet and win the game is really pleasing. "[In the] first half we were good, deserved our lead and I think in the game we probably had the better chances. But in the second half we stopped doing what we were doing in the first half. "A win's a win. That's what we said before [the game] - by hook or by crook we need to get three points to get us up this league." Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: "We look at today's defeat as self-inflicted. I felt in the first twenty minutes we were in control and they were very low confidence. "I was fully aware that they were struggling but their goalkeeper made some very important saves. "I was probably more disappointed from the time that they scored the goal, which seemed to give them a lift and I felt that we never did enough today. "We didn't contribute enough and there were some choice words at half-time. "I think we looked more with it in the second-half. And I ask my players why didn't we hurt them enough." </body>

      <title>Fresh barracks death inquest call</title>
      <description>Calls are made for a fresh inquest into the 1995 death of an Army recruit from Denbighshire, one of four at the Surrey barracks within seven years.</description>

      <body>Calls have been made by a human rights group for a fresh inquest into the death of an 18-year-old Army recruit from Denbighshire. Liberty is representing the parents of Cheryl James, from Llangollen, who died in November 1995 at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. She was one of four soldiers who died there between 1995 and 2002, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The attorney general's office said it was considering the application. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995, just months before Pte James's death, also from gunshot wounds. In September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head, and six months later, Pte James Collinson, from Perth, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin. A Surrey Police investigation was launched into the deaths in 2002, following pressure from the families who rejected suggestions the soldiers had committed suicide and called for a public inquiry. Later, a report by the Adult Learning Inspectorate, commissioned by the armed forces minister called for substantial reforms in the training of new recruits. A later investigation by deputy high court judge Nicholas Blake QC called for an independent ombudsman for the armed forces, but rejected the families' calls for a public inquiry. It also concluded that Ptes Gray, James and Benton had committed suicide. An inquest into Pte James' death held shortly after it happened recorded an open verdict. On Friday, Liberty announced it is applying for a fresh inquest into Pte James' death and will soon be doing the same on behalf of the parents of Pte Benton. The group said its application to the attorney general comes after using the Human Rights Act to get access to documentation about Pte James' death that her family have never seen, claiming 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs contain evidence that has never before been properly examined and suggesting witnesses may have lied. A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence. If the attorney general gives his consent, the matter will be referred to the High Court for consideration, Liberty said. Legal officer Emma Norton said: "Cheryl's grieving family have been consistently snubbed by the state in their quest to discover what really happened to their daughter - only a fresh inquest can deliver the truth they so deserve. "The human rights of our troops are worthy of exactly the same protection as everyone else - until what happened to these young people at Deepcut is competently, calmly and independently investigated, justice will not be done". Pte James' parents Des and Doreen James added: "We're disappointed it has taken close to 18 years for us to even get disclosure of the evidence related to Cheryl's premature death. "No family should ever have to go through what we've experienced, and the fact there still has never been any meaningful inquiry into the four deaths at Deepcut remains a stain on the integrity of everyone involved. "All four were placed in the care of the state and all four were badly let down. "The implications of the new evidence is both serious and extremely worrying for us but we have every confidence in Liberty and our entire legal team." A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office confirmed that it had received an application from Liberty seeking the attorney general's consent to apply for a new inquest into Pte James' death, and it was being considered. </body>

      <body>NHS staff in Powys are being offered the flu vaccination to prevent passing the bug onto patients and their families this winter. The aim is to keep staff fit and healthy and reduce the chance of spreading flu to vulnerable people. This year a needle-free version of the vaccine is also being offered to two and three-year-olds at GP surgeries and year seven pupils at school. The vaccine will be offered to vulnerable people as normal. Jane Davies, a health protection nurse with Powys Teaching Health Board, said "Vaccinating our staff is not just about ensuring that they can continue to work and care for patients, but is also about reducing the chance of them spreading flu to the more vulnerable people that they come into contact with." Dr Catherine Woodward, the health board's director of public health, said flu was "very contagious" and was easily passed to vulnerable people. "Each year sees a different strain of flu circulating so we need to have a new vaccine every year," she added. </body>

      <description>About £350,000 is being spent fixing a roof at a primary school built just six years ago following warnings the problem could force its closure.</description>

      <body>About £350,000 is being spent fixing a roof at a primary school built just six years ago following warnings the problem could force its closure. Ceredigion council said some classrooms at Ysgol Ffynnonbedr in Lampeter could not be used during heavy rain. One report criticised the way the roof had been constructed. Contractor Balfour Beatty said it took care to provide an excellent service and had been working closely with Ceredigion council. The school was built six years ago by Cowlin Construction Ltd, which was part of Balfour Beatty but no longer exists as a brand. A Ceredigion council cabinet report said the leaks, which had occurred during the last two years, were affecting the school's electrics. "These leaks have caused inconvenience to the school during periods of heavy or driving rain," said the report. "Discussions have been held with the responsible contractor, Cowlin Construction Ltd, and a course of action was agreed to provide and install additional ventilation in the roof of the school where it was found the contractor had not complied with the contract specification. "Unfortunately, these trial remedial works in addressing the penetration of water into the building were not successful." It added the Building Research Establishment (BRE) had been appointed as an independent technical adviser to determine the causes of problem. BRE found the roof was "not constructed in accordance with the contract specification and that the materials used have proved to be defective as built". The council report said: "The extent of the defects in the roof are leading to the deterioration of the structure and fabric of the school and may now result in the closure of the school in the near future because the multiple leaks are affecting electrical installations and rendering teaching spaces unusable. "After further discussions with the responsible contractor and our legal services team it has not been possible to resolve the dispute, therefore, it was decided to offer the remedial works required as specified by the BRE to the market to determine a tender sum for these works. "Tenders for the work have been returned with the accepted tender in the region of £350,000." The council said work had started to recover the costs from Balfour Beatty but it said the company had not accepted responsibility for the roofing problems. A Balfour Beatty spokesman said: "We take care to ensure that we provide an excellent service for our customers both during and after our projects, and we have been working closely with Ceredigion County Council regarding this issue." </body>

      <body>Ospreys coach Steve Tandy has pledged they will fight on despite suffering a second successive Heineken Cup Pool 1 defeat. They followed up a home loss by Leinster with a 27-16 defeat at Northampton's Franklin's Gardens. That left the Welsh region pointless at the bottom of their pool. "No-one has ever qualified from losing their first two games, but we will be preparing for Castres in December as if we are still involved," said Tandy. "We need to pick up points and wins. In this tournament, it is unforgiving. "If you don't take your opportunities or get the bounce of the ball, then it does get difficult. We had opportunities, but didn't quite take them. "The squad showed their true character. At 17-6 down, we could quite easily have folded and let the tournament go, but it is a group that fights. "When people put them down, they keep fighting." Tries by Christian Day and Samu Manoa helped the Saints to a 17-6 lead at the break. Fly-half Dan Biggar went over as the visitors fought back, but a Lee Dickson touch down ensured victory for the hosts. Tandy added: "We were down 17-6 at half-time, and when we got back to 17-13 I really did think we were going to turn the corner. "We were building momentum, but we conceded a sloppy try. "The squad showed their true character. At 17-6 down, we could quite easily have folded and let the tournament go, but it is a group that fights. "When people put them down, they keep fighting." Swansea-based Ospreys face back-to-back clashes against French side Castres in December and end their qualification stage with games against Northampton and Leinster in January. </body>

      <body>A police officer has won a national bravery award after he risked his life to save a drowning teenager from a quarry in Carmarthenshire. PC Alun Morgan from the Dyfed-Powys force won the Police Federation prize at a ceremony in London. But despite his efforts in June 2012 at Cilrychen Quarry, Llandybie, 14-year-old Luke Somerfield died. PC Morgan was one of the first on the scene and dived into the water after hearing the screams of upset children. Luke, from Llandeilo, had been in Cilyrychen Quarry with three friends. An inquest into the teenager's death in August last year heard that he became tangled in rope from a lifesaving ring and drowned. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. PC Morgan and his colleagues arrived at the quarry to find it enclosed by an 8ft (2.5m) high chain-link fence, with two lines of barbed wire above and no obvious way to get inside or out. He cut a hole in the fence and asked a worker from a neighbouring engineering firm to cut the chains on the nearby gates so other emergency vehicles could get in. PC Morgan, a former lifeguard, then sprinted to the edge of the quarry lake and, after speaking to witnesses, he tied a rescue line to himself and dived 15ft (4.5m) down to rescue the boy. Luke later died in hospital. PC Morgan, who won the Welsh region police bravery award, said: "It was very tragic and it's bitter sweet to win this award. Sadly the little boy died but we did our best for him as a team. "You don't think about the dangers when you go in, adrenaline kicks in and you just do it. It's only afterwards you start to think about things. "I just wanted to get to the boy as quickly as I could and get him out. I'm very proud and I didn't expect it all." PC Morgan said the Luke Somerfield Memorial Trust had been set up in Luke's memory to educate youngsters about the dangers of water. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Congratulations to PC Morgan for receiving the police bravery award for the Welsh region. "In very traumatic circumstances, knowing the risks involved and despite instructions not to, PC Morgan plunged into treacherous quarry waters. "He risked his own life, determined to save another. PC Morgan's bravery, endurance and dedication to duty cannot be underestimated." </body>

      <body>Wales rugby league coach Iestyn Harris says he is flattered to be linked with the role of backs coach at Cardiff Blues. The Blues are looking to replace for Gareth Baber, who leaves at the end of the year. Harris has been mentioned as a successor but the ex-Blues player says he is focused on the World Cup. "It's pleasing to be linked but at this stage the World Cup is my priority," Harris said. "What I'm concentrating on is the World Cup and we've spent a lot of time planning for the World Cup. "It's important for me we prepare the team correctly and that's what we're doing. "Any outside influence and any outside speculation is irrelevant to me at this stage." Wales face Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Great Britain and Wales rugby league international Harris switched codes to union in 2001 and spent three years in Wales playing for Cardiff, Cardiff Blues and the national side. Harris won 24 caps for Wales' rugby union side and played at the 2003 Rugby World Cup before returning to rugby league in 2004. After retiring from a playing career which took in spells with Warrington, Leeds Rhinos and Bradford Bulls, Harris switched to coaching and was in charge of Crusaders in Super League. As well as being Wales' head coach, Harris is assistant coach at Wigan Warriors and is pleased with how his coaching career is progressing. "As you progress through the coaching years and as you improve yourself you inevitably will get linked with certain jobs," Harris added. "Hopefully my progression is heading in the right direction, which I believe it is." </body>

      <title>Davies praises 'magnificent' Blues</title>
      <description>Cardiff Blues were "magnificent" and "superb" in beating Heineken Cup holders Toulon, says boss Phil Davies.</description>

      <body>Cardiff Blues director of rugby Phil Davies has praised his side as "magnificent" and "superb" for beating Heineken Cup holders Toulon 19-15 a week after being hammered at Exeter. "The players were magnificent, they fronted up superbly. It was a great win against a very good team," said Davies. Jonny Wilkinson edged a kicking duel with Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny that gave the French side a 15-12 lead. But replacement Gareth Davies scored a dramatic late try to beat Toulon. Former England and British and Irish Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked five penalties to Patchell's single success and Halfpenny's trio of shots to leave the Blues trailing 15-12 going into the last 10 minutes. Davies had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson's last kick went over and finished off a move started by centre Cory Allen in style. Wales and Lions star Halfpenny added the conversion and the Blues held out as Toulon launched a series of late attacks. The scenes of celebration that followed were in stark contrast to those that were witnessed at Exeter, where Davies' side conceded five first-half tries. Davies said: "We were disappointed with the first half last week, but we showed a lot of resilience in the second period to come back and get a bonus point. "And that bonus point looks pretty good today. "Physically and emotionally, the players went perhaps to another level today. "I think that was the youngest back division that Cardiff Blues have ever put on the field. "We are back in the group, which is the most important thing. "We've just got to keep building and building and become more consistent. "It was great we got the result and it was great to hear the crowd singing. It was like the old days. "We will keep moving forward and hopefully we can replicate more days like this one." </body>

      <title>Enterprise zone jobs 'in pipeline'</title>
      <description>The first minister says there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones, as he also announces 100 new jobs in the Cardiff zone.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70612000/png/_70612440_vlcsnap-2013-10-21-13h43m13s126.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The first minister has said there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones. Carwyn Jones' comments came as he announced accountancy firm Deloitte will create 100 jobs in the Cardiff zone over the next three years. He also announced a cut in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Welsh Conservatives say the enterprise zones still have "a long way to go". At his monthly press conference, the first minister defended his Welsh government's enterprise zone policy saying they "are the envy of the rest of the UK". There are seven enterprise zones in Wales, each dedicated to nurture specific industries. Companies have access to a range of benefits, including business rate relief, enhanced capital allowances, skills support, superfast broadband, bespoke infrastructure projects and simplified planning rules. Carwyn Jones said almost 2,000 jobs have been created across the seven zones, with a further 6,500 planned, 3,000 of them in the Cardiff zone. Located in the centre of the capital, a further 100 jobs are set to be created in the zone dedicated to financial services as financial advisory firm Deloitte's is set to expand. Deloitte will set up the Cardiff Centre of Excellence to support its International Assignment Services, helping employers meet tax compliance. The Welsh government has invested £170,000 into the project, which will centralise client administration and support. Carwyn Jones welcomed the news at the firm's Cardiff headquarters. "This latest expansion which is set to create 100 jobs in Cardiff sends out a strong message that Wales is becoming the location of choice for companies operating in the professional and financial services sector that are looking to grow their business," he said. "I am hugely encouraged that Cardiff has been selected and confident this latest project will build on the success of their quality and risk operations team in Cardiff. "Wales is the first place in the UK with an enterprise zone dedicated to this sector and Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone is helping to enhance the city's position as a capital location for professional business services." Shadow Minister for Business Nick Ramsay AM, said: "This is extremely welcome news - and long overdue. "Progress on the Labour government's enterprise zone in Cardiff has been disappointingly slow - and today's announcement is a step in the right direction. "In the two years since this zone's announcement, very little has been announced and very few details released. "There is a long way to go on every enterprise zone in Wales and I am pleased that some progress is finally being made." The first minister also announced SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment bank. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to look at the bank's interest rates more widely. Eluned Parrott AM, said: "This announcement will be welcomed by small and medium sized businesses planning on investing in Enterprise Zones, however, questions still have to be answered as to why Finance Wales's interest rates are higher than they need to be across the country. "I do hope that the Welsh Government will look seriously at the interest rates it is offering through Finance Wales across the country, and take action to ensure that its rates are comparable with the market not unnecessarily expensive for companies who are trying to create wealth and encourage growth." The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the announcement raises some questions. FSB Welsh Policy Unit chair Janet Jones said: "The announcement of a 2% cut in rates from Finance Wales for businesses in Welsh enterprise zones is welcome, but rather perplexing. "The Welsh government's own report into access to finance by Professor Dylan Jones-Evans noted that Finance Wales' interest rates were often well above their regulatory requirements. "FSB Wales agrees with that assessment, and this announcement suggests that there is more flexibility in Finance Wales' setting of its interest rates than was previously stated. "In the light of this announcement we would call for Finance Wales to re-examine its rates as it appears that state aid rules do not require rates to be as high as they are at present," she added. </body>

      <title>Rail disruption during major events</title>
      <description>The first minister criticises the timing of engineering work on the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff.</description>

      <body>The first minister has criticised Network Rail over the closure of the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff. The tunnel will close for maintenance work on the same weekend as the opening ceremony for the Rugby League World Cup, and the Womex music festival. Speaking to BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Carwyn Jones said Network Rail had not consulted the Welsh government over the closure. Network Rail said it was vital work. But Mr Jones said: "They've got form on this. It's an important point here - when we've got events in Cardiff, why do maintenance work on the Severn Tunnel when those events are taking place? "If there were events taking place every single week in the Millennium Centre, the Millennium Stadium or the [Cardiff] City Stadium, you might say 'okay, there are some weekends when that's inevitable' but for some reason they choose weekends when there are big events taking place in Cardiff." The Severn Tunnel - which runs under the River Severn on the south Wales-London mainline - will be closed for maintenance on the weekend of 26-27 October - the same weekend as the Rugby League World Cup opening ceremony at the Millennium Stadium and Womex world music festival at the Millennium Centre. Mr Jones believes the closures will cause travel problems, having a negative impact on the world-wide image of Wales. He said a similar closure in 1999 caused problems for fans travelling to and from the Wales v England rugby international at Wembley Stadium in London. Mr Jones added that he recognised the need for maintenance and regretted that an alternative rail route was not considered when the second Severn bridge was built. "The big problem is of course that a rail deck wasn't put on the Severn Bridge in 1993 - other countries would have done that - and we wouldn't have these problems with the Severn Tunnel," said the first minister. "Yes it needs maintenance. It's a very wet tunnel [I know] having been through there in a cab of a 125 [train], but let's do it when there's not a big game on in Cardiff." In a statement Network Rail told Sunday Politics Wales: "There is never a good time to do work on the Severn Tunnel and we thoroughly investigated the Welsh government's request. "In this instance, this six-week works package was planned two years in advance and had already been put back a week to accommodate the one-day cricket match between England and Australia in September. "This vital project cannot be put back any further and to cancel it would have a negative impact on services from south Wales to London." Network Rail added it had assured the organisers of the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup that it would not schedule any disruptive work during the period the tournament was on at the Millennium Stadium. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 20 October. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <body>Jonathan de Guzman says he is fully focused on Swansea before he can start thinking about next summer's World Cup. The Netherlands midfielder scored Swansea's second goal in a 4-0 win over struggling Sunderland at the Liberty Stadium. And the on-loan Villarreal player hopes his performances for Swansea this season will secure a place in the Netherlands' World Cup squad. "The World Cup is at the back of my mind," De Guzman said. "Right now I'm focused on Swansea, getting my minutes and playing. Hopefully that will get my ticket to Brazil." Canadian-born de Guzman has won six caps for the Netherlands but did not feature in their recent World Cup qualifiers against Hungary and Turkey. De Guzman scored a spectacular goal in Swansea's 4-0 win over Sunderland and admitted the second-half performance was an improvement on the first 45 minutes. Victory over the Premier League's bottom side, who had new manager Gus Poyet at the helm for the first time, was Swansea's first home league win since March. "I think the first half was a bit sloppy with the passing and I I think in the second half we raised the tempo a bit with the movement off the ball," de Guzman added. "We got rewarded - we got four goals in one half so it was very good for us. [It was] a deserved win." Attention now turns to Thursday's home Europa League game against Russian side Kuban Krasnodar. Swansea are top of Group A after wins over Valencia and St Gallen, and victory over the bottom side would put them in a strong position to reach the last 32. "With nine points in three games we'll have one foot in the knockout stages," De Guzman said. "I know they beat my ex-club [Feyenoord] in the qualification round but other than that I don't know that much. "Of course that is what our staff is here for, to prepare us for these games and watch the videos of the teams. "We're going to get the preparation but of course it's always different on the pitch. But I think the preparation we'll have before this game will be key." </body>

      <body>Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall says Chelsea's equaliser was a game-changer in the 4-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge. Eden Hazard scored after Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away as Marshall bounced it, which according to Fifa's rules is a foul. Cardiff boss Malky Mackay said referee Anthony Taylor's decision to allow the goal was a "horrendous error". "Goals change games - it was a silly goal to lose," Marshall said. "I'm just gutted that it's affected everybody." Cardiff had taken the lead on 10 minutes when Jordon Mutch ran through to score after David Luiz's mistake - but the controversy came in the 33rd minute. "It's a habit of mine," added Scotland international Marshall. "I always bounce the ball before kicking the ball so [it's] probably my fault." Goals from Eto'o, Oscar and a second from Hazard after half-time sealed victory but Marshall said defeat was harsh on Cardiff and he felt the tactics had "frustrated" Chelsea up until the crucial equaliser. "It's just disappointing because we had a game plan and it was working up until then," he said. "They're always going to have chances at some point and we knew we would have to defend well. I thought the boys were fantastic in front of me. "I've apologised to the boys at half-time. I was just disappointed to lose it." Despite his disappointment, Marshall said Cardiff must forget the Chelsea defeat as they prepare for next Saturday's trip to Norwich City. Norwich, Marshall's former club, lost 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and are in the bottom three - two places and a point behind Cardiff. "We've got Norwich coming up now which is a massive game," Marshall said. </body>

      <body>England lock Courtney Lawes impressed as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup. A Samu Manoa try and Stephen Myler conversion and penalty gave Northampton the lead before Dan Biggar landed two penalties for the visitors. Christian Day's converted try made it 17-6 at the break, only for Ospreys to hit back through a try, conversion and penalty from Biggar. But Ben Foden added a third Northampton try and Myler's boot saw Saints home. The hosts will be frustrated not to have secured a bonus point for scoring four tries, with George Pisi held a couple of feet short from a last-gasp Northampton attack, but in the end they were convincing winners. Lawes, along with fellow England forwards Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood, was outstanding in all facets of the game, although the lock's work at the line-out and in the tackle - he made 20 - was particularly noteworthy. And the 6ft 7in second row set the tone from the first whistle as he drilled Tom Habberfield backwards when the Ospreys scrum-half caught the kick-off. George North then hammered into midfield and an Ospreys offside gave Myler the chance to kick the hosts into the lead. When Manoa picked up from the base of a five-metre scrum and went over untouched, with Myler converting, with less than 15 minutes played it seemed as though Northampton were set for an easy win. But Ospreys, who went into the game on the back of a disappointing home defeat by Leinster, were determined to put up a fight and two Biggar penalties cut the gap to four points. However, Northampton were looking by far the more threatening side and they added to their lead almost immediately. Luther Burrell made a couple of big carries into midfield before the hosts went wide and Lawes - who had started things with a soaring line-out take - sent second row partner Day over in the corner for a converted score. It was turning into a spectacular game, with Northampton fizzing the ball about at pace but unable to finish things off, and the visitors prepared to counter-attack whenever they were presented with the opportunity. They turned round 17-6 down, needing to score next if the match was not to run away from them, and they duly lifted their game after the restart. Captain Alun Wyn Jones was at the heart of their charge and after he was held inches short, Biggar wriggled his way over by the posts before adding the conversion. Suddenly there were only four points in it and Northampton's cause was not helped as Myler missed a simple penalty, but approaching the hour mark they stretched clear again. The Saints pack bullied their way to within inches of the line from a line-out drive before Lee Dickson sent full-back Foden over unopposed. Myler converted from out wide and an exchange of penalties by the two fly-halves concluded the scoring, with a potentially important fourth try for Saints proving elusive. Northampton boss Jim Mallinder: "Courtney Lawes was sensational, not just in his restarts, but his defence as well. He is consistently making big tackles, he consistently makes big carries and he is doing that for 80 minutes now. "He was in and out of games a little bit in the past, now he is a complete player for the full game. "It was a satisfying win for us. We played well and scored three really good team tries. It would have been lovely to have sneaked a bonus point at the end, but it means we are going into the back-to-back games against Leinster in December with everything to play for." Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy: "We were down 17-6 at half-time, and when we got back to 17-13 I really did think we were going to turn the corner. We were building momentum, but we conceded a sloppy try. "No-one has ever qualified from losing their first two games, but we will be preparing for Castres in December as if we are still involved. We need to pick up points and wins." Northampton: Foden; Elliott, G Pisi, Burrell, North; Myler, L Dickson; A Waller, Hartley, Ma'afu, Lawes, Day, Dowson, Wood, Manoa.

      <title>Community marks reservoir fight win</title>
      <description>Village saved from drowning half a century ago</description>

      <body>Residents of a small Carmarthenshire community are marking 50 years since their village was saved from being turned into a reservoir. Residents living in Llangyndeyrn in the Gwendraeth Valley found out about Swansea Water Corporation's plans in a newspaper article on 16 March, 1960. A three-year legal battle - and a week-long stand-off - ensued, which eventually proved successful. And now the event is being commemorated with a gala dinner and concert. Arwyn Richards, 80, was one of those who helped man the barricades when surveyors accompanied by Swansea's bailiffs attempted to move in on 21 October, 1963. "I was a man in the prime of my life, but there were also babes-in-arms and people so old that they could hardly make it up the hill to the farm," he said. "That's how much the entire community was behind this. We even drew up a rota of people who were prepared to go to prison if necessary. "If you were the only breadwinner in a family then you weren't expected to get yourself arrested, but anyone who could afford to said they'd do whatever it took to stop the diggers getting in." But Mr Richards explained that despite a week-long stand-off, it never reached the point of anyone actually being arrested. He said: "We tried to do everything properly - we'd taken them to court and had a public inquiry but when all that failed we had to do whatever it took. "There were tractors and combine harvesters and chains and fences to stop them, and if they'd have made it past them then they'd still have had to get through 100 or so of us. "In the end this man shook his fist at us and said he'd be back, but they never were." Faced by mounting public opinion, Swansea Corporation instead opted for an alternative site at nearby Llyn Brianne. While it required more engineering and has a smaller capacity, it meant the destruction of just one derelict farmhouse, as opposed to chapels, homes and 600 acres of fertile farmland in Llangyndeyrn. David Thomas, whose grandfather William was head of Gwendraeth Rural District Council throughout the period, is co-chair of the anniversary celebrations. "The obvious comparison to make is with the drowning of Capel Celyn to form the Tryweryn reservoir to provide water for Liverpool," he said. "And whilst there are similarities, there were key differences too. "My grandfather and the local minister WM Rees were determined to succeed but equally determined that it shouldn't become political. "The advantage we had was that there wasn't the nationalist element of England doing this to Wales - we were doing it to each other." He added: "Not even the people of Swansea wanted this, they campaigned against it almost as hard as we did," he added. "That's why people here always make a distinction between the residents of Swansea and their council." Mr Thomas said that in the intervening 50 years, Swansea council had never said sorry. "I don't know if an apology would make any difference now, it's been so long and all the people have changed, but yes, I think it would be a nice gesture at least," he said. But he also thinks Llangyndeyrn has ultimately benefited from the saga. He said: "I suppose it's easy for me to say now - I was only a toddler at the time - but yes, I think ultimately it was the best thing that ever happened to Llangyndeyrn. "Of course everyone feared the worst and nothing can make up for the worry of those three years, but on the day Swansea Corporation turned-tail and ran, our village was reborn. "You only have to look at the youngsters who've got involved with the celebrations. "If this had been allowed to happen then our community would have been scattered to the winds and half of them would never have been born. "But as it is, at a time when rural societies all over Wales are breaking down, ours is going from strength to strength." </body>

      <description>Talks to ensure housing for new nuclear power station builders</description>

      <body>Talks will take place about how to ensure adequate housing for workers set to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey. The island's council said if the £8bn Wylfa B project went ahead, an extra 3,500 people would need somewhere to live while it was being built. A third would stay in private rented property while others would buy new homes or use tourist houses, it said. But there is a fear of price increases, making it harder for locals to buy. Wylfa B forms part of the nuclear project Horizon which also includes proposals for a new nuclear power station at Oldbury, in South Gloucestershire. Japanese company Hitachi bought Horizon for £700m a year ago after the two German companies behind the project - E.ON and RWE - announced they were pulling out. Next year Horizon will hold a first phase of formal public consultation, with plans for initial site work to begin from 2015. Major on-site work would start in 2018 with the first electricity being generated by the mid-2020s. New houses are already being built on Anglesey - such as at Benllech - but Shan Williams, the council's head of housing services, said plans for homes for the nuclear project workers were still at an early stage. "We will need to have more information from the developers," she said. "We will be doing some work with private sector landlords and starting to build additional affordable housing on the island." Many people on the island say local people need to come first whether it is for new homes, new jobs or the new power station. But Anglesey council admitted it had to plan for a situation where workers came in from outside to avoid being caught off guard. The island's assembly member, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was something which needed to be carefully managed and that many of the jobs that came up needed to be kept "as local as possible". He added: "With the building phase, let's make sure that it brings money into the island but it doesn't leave us with a housing crisis - and there is a potential for that." Dafydd Hardy, an estate agent working in Gwynedd and Anglesey, said the island was not seeing a house price boom yet. But he agreed that it was a situation that needed to be handled carefully, because a housing boom meant homes would be harder for local people to afford. "Any estate agent would agree with that, they don't want that," he said. "They want sustainability in the market. "I think there is a concern with regards to protecting the prices for the local people because they need to have affordability and we don't want to see them priced out of the market." One thing that officials had hoped could help was a proposed massive leisure park in Holyhead. Developer Land and Lakes said the 800 holiday lodges and cottages could be used temporarily by Wylfa B construction workers. But the plans were turned down earlier this month although that decision still has to be finalised in the next few weeks. </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Health boards failing to supply pumps to diabetic children</description>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent £500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 20 October at 12:00 BST. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <body>Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away after 14 caravans moved onto the 300-space area. Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on. He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result. But one hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said it was "infuriating". "Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing," the worker said. "I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. "There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. "They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp." Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: "Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. "It just shouldn't be allowed to happen. "It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. "I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon." Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately 65 spaces. "We will ensure that security is available on site from 6am-10pm every day to reassure and support staff," he said. "We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible - there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible. "There has been no disruption to hospital services and, in the main, staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning." </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Some health boards are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales finds.</description>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent £500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 20 October at 12:00 BST. </body>

      <title>GP exam 'unfair to minorities'</title>
      <description>British ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, an investigation commissioned by the General Medical Council finds.</description>

      <body>UK ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, the General Medical Council has found. The review into 5,000 candidates was ordered after ethnic minority students complained the exam was unfair. Prof Aneez Esmail, an expert on racism in the NHS who led the investigation, said "unconscious bias" could explain the findings. But the Royal College of GPs, which sets the exams, denies they are unfair. RCGP chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the college took equality and diversity issues "extremely seriously". She added that the college: "strongly refutes any allegations that the exam is discriminatory in any way". The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) - introduced in 2010 - is a practical test in which trainee GPs are assessed by an examiner while they treat actors in a mock-surgery setting. They have up to four attempts to take the test which they must pass before they can practise as a GP. During the six-month review for the GMC, Prof Esmail analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said he could not exclude racial discrimination as the cause of the findings. He told BBC One's Breakfast: "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. "So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way." "So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore," he added. "It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." He said all British doctors, whether white or from ethnic minorities, had "gone through medical school and passed all that and so we're not talking about people who aren't as good as - they're exactly the same". He said the test was "a relatively new technique that's being used and it's bound to improve as time goes on". He has made a number of recommendations to try to combat bias in the exam including having more examiners and actors who are from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the RGCP's Dr Clare Gerada said the review found "no evidence, either through the examiners or through the actors, or through the process of the examination, of discrimination". She added that, "in fact, what it showed was that it was probably preparedness for the exam that was a factor". "We already take comprehensive steps to ensure that the exam is fair and equitable to all candidates," she told BBC News. "This exam is designed for doctors to practise independently; it is not an exam that has to be passed by everyone. I think that is a very important issue. "Of course we cannot be complacent and we continue to make sure the exam does not have bias built in." The review also found that trainee GPs from abroad were 14 times more likely to fail the CSA exam than white British doctors. "We also know that eventually they pass," Dr Gerada said. "We also know that this is a culturally specific exam - it stands to reason if you are born and brought up in this country, within the NHS, that you have an advantage," she added. "If I go to India and sit an exam designed for doctors to practise in India, I will be at a disadvantage." GP Una Coales, meanwhile, said that, "because they use predominantly white actors, even the white actors may not even be aware that they have hidden bias against foreigners". "So if they hear an Indian dialect, for instance, they might pretend that they don't understand them and they might subconsciously withhold vital clues," she said. She said the actors could "give away the agenda or the concern right away if he happens to like you or can withhold it for eight minutes of a 10-minute exam". Organisations representing ethnic minority doctors have threatened legal action against the RCGP. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), said: "Hundreds of doctors' careers have been damaged because they have repeatedly failed the CSA exam. "They are facing institutional bias and are unfairly failing the exam despite extensive training and knowledge." BAPIO has been given permission to launch a judicial review against the RCGP and the GMC over the exam. The General Medical Council said it took the findings of the independent review seriously. "We agree with Prof Esmail that there is no room for complacency - we want to work with him and all those involved in this area," chief executive Niall Dickson said. "We are duty-bound to act where there is evidence of a problem and his report and recommendations make a powerful case for action." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014 with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes, some of whom get regular visits but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and were more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." Mr Hunt's speech came as a BBC poll found that almost half of all adults said they experienced feelings of loneliness. The survey of more than 2,500 adults in England was commissioned for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Local Radio's Faith In The World Week. It also showed that people who practised a religion felt lonelier than those who did not. London was identified the loneliest place with a figure of 52% compared with 45% in the south west of England. </body>

      <title>Talking therapy 'eases hypochondria'</title>
      <description>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people who have health anxiety or hypochondria, say researchers writing in The Lancet.</description>

      <body>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people with hypochondria or health anxiety, say researchers writing in The Lancet. In their study, 14% of patients given CBT regained normal anxiety levels against 7% given the usual care of basic reassurance. It said nurses could easily be trained to offer the psychological therapy. Between 10% and 20% of hospital patients are thought to worry obsessively about their health. Previous studies have shown that CBT, which aims to change thought patterns and behaviour, is an effective treatment for other anxiety disorders. But there is a shortage of specialists trained to deliver CBT, and as a result waiting lists can be long. In this study, 219 people with health anxiety received an average of six sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy while 225 received reassurance and support, which is standard. After periods of six months and 12 months, patients in the CBT group showed "significantly greater improvement in self-rated anxiety and depression symptoms" compared with standard care, the study showed. There was also a particularly noticeable reduction in health anxiety in the CBT group straight after treatment began. The therapy was delivered by non-CBT experts who had been trained in only two workshops. Study author Prof Peter Tyrer, head of the Centre for Mental Health at Imperial College London, said the results showed that hypochondria could be successfully treated, in a "relatively cheap" way, by general nurses with minimal training in a hospital setting. Reducing the anxiety levels of 14% of the CBT group might not seem a high figure, he said, but these were often people with serious problems who had sometimes spent thousands of pounds on private health assessments because of fears about their health. "Health anxiety is costly for healthcare providers and an effective treatment could potentially save money by reducing the need for unnecessary tests and emergency hospital admissions," Prof Tyrer said. Writing about the study in The Lancet, Chris Williams from the University of Glasgow and Allan House from the University of Leeds, said the findings were "intriguing" but translating them into services was "problematic". They also questioned the cost-effectiveness of screening patients for health anxiety and CBT. They wrote: "Health anxiety is only one of the problems noted in medical outpatients - depression, hazardous alcohol use, poor treatment adherence, and other forms of medically unexplained presentation all press for recognition and intervention. "To develop multiple parallel services makes no sense, especially since the common emotional disorders overlap substantially." But Prof Tyrer said health anxiety was a hidden epidemic that required the correct treatment, not just reassurance. </body>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <body>Northern Ireland Finance Minister Simon Hamilton has announced that a new children's hospital is to be built in Belfast. The £250m facility will replace the existing hospital on the Royal site in Belfast. The announcement was made as part of a reallocation of unspent funds, mainly from the stalled A5 road project. The Department of Health has been allocated £52m, £15.5m of which is to go towards the new hospital. It is expected to be completed by 2020/2021. The department has also been allocated £14m to address waiting lists. Mr Hamilton said he had recently visited the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and was "shocked and ashamed" by the conditions. Building on the new hospital could begin next year. Other health projects allocated money include: Mr Hamilton has also given the green light to dualling the Frosses Road section of the A26. "The allocations I have announced today will leave a lasting economic impact on Northern Ireland, boost our economy as the recovery gathers momentum and provide assistance for vulnerable people in our society," Mr Hamilton said. "I am especially pleased that we are able to fund a new regional children's hospital and significant strategic roads improvements." Health Minister Edwin Poots said the money would help provide services fit for the 21st century for children. "A replacement regional children's hospital is a major project that I have been keen to take forward, particularly as parts of the current facilities are nearly 100 years old," he said. "Securing this additional funding from the executive provides me with the opportunity to move this much needed project forward to ensure that our children will receive their care and treatment in a modern paediatric environment." </body>

      <description>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found.</description>

      <body>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found. It had been thought they could count towards the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense activity per week. But the BMC Public Health study, which surveyed over 4,500 adults, found those who counted housework were heavier than those who did other activities. Experts said activities only counted when they made breathing more rapid and the heart beat faster. NHS recommendations do say housework does not count towards the 150-minute goal. But the researchers in this paper say there has been a move towards promoting a "lifestyle approach" to physical activity - encouraging "domestic" activities in people who may not take part in sports or go to the gym. And they warn that, while any activity is better than none, people should be aware that they still need to meet the moderate activity target on top. Participants completed a detailed interview about their activity levels, whether they played any sports or did formal exercise as well as their diet and smoking and drinking habits. They were particularly asked about activity linked to looking after their homes. Domestic housework in 10 minute bursts or more accounted for 36% of the reported moderate to vigorous physical activity people said they did. But when weight and height were taken into account, researchers found that those who counted housework as exercise were heavier than people doing other exercise for the same amount of time. Among women, just a fifth reached the weekly exercise target if housework was discounted. The research team, which included experts from the Universities of Ulster, Sheffield Hallam and Wolverhampton as well as Sport Northern Ireland concluded: "Domestic physical activity accounts for a significant proportion of self-reported daily moderate to vigorous physical activity particularly among females and older adults. "However such activity is negatively associated with leanness, suggesting that such activity may not be sufficient to provide all of the benefits normally associated with meeting the physical activity guidelines." Prof Marie Murphy, from the University of Ulster, who led the study, said: "Housework is physical activity and any physical activity should theoretically increase the amount of calories expended. "But we found that housework was inversely related to leanness, which suggests that either people are overestimating the amount of moderate intensity physical activity they do through housework, or are eating too much to compensate for the amount of activity undertaken." She added: "When talking to people about the amount of physical activity they need to stay healthy, it needs to be made clear that housework may not be intense enough to contribute to the weekly target and that other more intense activities also need to be included each week." Chris Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Your exercise should make you breathe harder, feel warmer, and make your heart beat faster than usual. "So, unless your household chores tick all these boxes, they won't count. "If you're daunted by the prospect of a 150-minute target, think of it in 10-minute chunks. "It doesn't necessarily mean forking out for a gym membership either - try a brisk walk on your lunch break or make a resolution to take the stairs rather than the lift each morning." </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70287000/jpg/_70287873_sweetthings.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>
      <description>"The hopes and fears I have for my daughter"</description>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24550586</url>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Where deadly hyenas are used to treat mental illness</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Millions of people around the world have learned CPR on a mannequin known as Resusci Anne. The story of the 19th Century beauty behind the model - or at least, one version of it - will be told at a symposium in London to mark European Restart a Heart Day. But does anyone really know anything about her? The Lorenzi workshop is a small haven of peace and antiquity in the busy Parisian suburb of Arcueil. And it's the last of its kind. Downstairs the mouleurs, or cast-makers, create figurines, busts and statues, pouring plaster into moulds in much the same way they have since the family business started in the 1870s. But if you want to be face-to-face with history, pick your way up the dusty wooden stairs to a room above the workshop. It's an unsettling experience. Hanging all around you in the narrow attic are life and death masks of poets and artists, politicians and revolutionaries: Napoleon, Robespierre, Verlaine, Victor Hugo, the robust, impatient face of the living Beethoven and the sallow, diminished features of the composer's death mask. Yet, surprisingly, of all the visages of the great and the good on display at Lorenzi's, the best-seller is the mask of a young woman. She has a pleasant, attractive face, with the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Her eyes are closed but they look as if they might spring open at any moment. Hers is the one mask that has no name. She's known simply as the Inconnue, the unknown woman of the Seine. This is how her story goes. Some time in the late 19th Century, the drowned body of a young woman was recovered from the River Seine. As was customary in those days, her body was put on display at the Paris mortuary, in the hope that someone would recognise and identify her. The pathologist on duty became so entranced by the face of the girl with the enigmatic half-smile that he asked a moulder to take a plaster cast of her face. Before long the mask began to appear for sale outside the mouleurs' workshops on the Left Bank and soon the young woman's face became a muse for artists, novelists and poets, all eager to weave imagined identities and stories around the mystery woman, this drowned Mona Lisa. Over the years Rilke, Louis Aragon, Man Ray and Vladimir Nabokov successively fell under the Inconnue's spell and at one time no fashionable European drawing room was complete without a mask of the Inconnue on the wall. One of the first stories featuring her was the 1899 novella The Worshipper of the Image by Richard le Gallienne, who portrays the mask as a malevolent force which bewitches and ultimately destroys a young poet. Other authors have been kinder, many of them telling the story of an innocent young woman from the country who comes to Paris, who's seduced by a rich lover and then abandoned when she falls pregnant. With nobody to turn to, she drowns herself in the waters of the Seine, a modern Ophelia. At the mortuary, her beautiful face, now peaceful in death, is preserved forever with a plaster cast. It was another drowning - or near-drowning - that ensured the Inconnue a place in medical history. In 1955 Asmund Laerdal saved the life of his young son, Tore, grabbing the boy's lifeless body from the water just in time and clearing his airways. Laerdal at that time was a successful Norwegian toy manufacturer, specialising in making children's dolls and model cars from the new generation of soft plastics. When he was approached to make a training aid for the newly-invented technique of CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the combination of chest compressions and the kiss of life which can save the life of a patient whose heart has stopped - his son's brush with death a few years earlier made him very receptive. He developed a torso or whole-body mannequin which simulates an unconscious patient requiring CPR. Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents' house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you're one of the 300 million people who's been trained in CPR, you've almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue's. Through Resusci Anne, students of first aid have for more than 50 years been trying to bring back to life the young woman from the Seine. But was the Inconnue actually dead in the first place? Is that peaceful face really a death mask or was it taken from a live model? When a few years ago I was making a Radio 4 programme about the Inconnue with the novelist Louise Welsh, we decided to show the mask to the men and women who specialise in recovering drowned bodies from the Seine - the Paris river police, known as the Brigade Fluviale. Sitting in the wheelhouse of one of the brigade's boats moored at their headquarters near the Pont d'Austerlitz, Chief Brigadier Pascal Jacquin was less than convinced that the girl was dead when the mask was made. "It's surprising to see such a peaceful face," he said. "Everyone we find in the water, the drowned and suicides, they never look so peaceful. They're swollen, they don't look nice." Over the centuries, artists and writers may have used the stories of Ophelia and the Lady of Shallot to portray drowning as a romantic and peaceful death but Pascal knows from years of dredging bodies out of the Seine that the truth is very different. Even suicides fight for life at the last moment and their faces betray that struggle. And the process of decomposition starts much more quickly in water too. This woman, he remarked, "looks like she's just asleep and waiting for Prince Charming to come". Like so many others before him, Jacquin's imagination had been piqued by the young woman's face and he had already begun to weave a tale of his own around the closed eyes, that secretive little smile and the enigma of the Inconnue. Other experts we consulted seemed to agree that the Inconnue seemed just too healthy, too vital for the mask to have been taken from a corpse. At the workshop in Arcueil, Michel Lorenzi, the current proprietor, is mystified by people's fascination with the Inconnue. "This doesn't look to me like the face of a dead person. It's very hard to maintain a smile while a cast is being taken so I think she was a professional, a very good model." For me the story has two postscripts. The first came a few weeks after the programme was broadcast in 2009. I was visiting Edward Chambre Hardman's photographic studio in Liverpool, the National Trust's perfectly preserved time capsule from the first half of the 20th Century, where anyone who was anyone in Liverpool sat for a portrait with Hardman. Seeing the mask of the Inconnue on the wall of his waiting room, I asked the guide, disingenuously, who the young woman was. Without hesitating she told me the story of two sisters, identical twins, who'd been born in Liverpool more than a century ago. One of them, she said, had embarked on a love affair with a rich suitor and eloped to Paris, never to be seen again. Many years later the other sister had visited Paris on holiday. Walking down a street she was shocked to see the mask of the drowned Inconnue hanging outside the mouleurs' workshops. She had instantly recognised the girl as her long-lost twin, condemned - or blessed - to remain forever young, while her sister grew old. I was captivated by the story. Once again, a tapestry of imagination had been woven around the enigma of the Inconnue and in this case it had been given a Liverpool twist. The other postscript comes from an Oxford-based artist called John Goto. Several years ago he decided to create his own fiction for the Inconnue. He constructed an apparently factual account of detective work and a trail of clues leading to the discovery of a turn-of-the-century carte de visite in a Buenos Aires junk shop. This and other evidence supposedly proved finally and beyond doubt the identity of the Inconnue - she was as a Hungarian actress named Ewa Lazlo, who was murdered by her lover, Louis Argon. Goto put the story and its "supporting evidence" online and moved on to other projects. It was intriguing, therefore, to come across details of this week's London symposium for European Restart a Heart Day. During the day a series of speakers share the latest research on improving survival rates after cardiac arrest. But in the evening entertainment is provided by the ensemble Mulberry Hawk. They're putting on a performance which, according to the blurb, "tells the story of Ewa Lazlo who became the inspiration for the face of Resusci Anne, the first CPR training manikin, and the most kissed girl in the world". So, I thought, Ewa is beginning to take on a life of her own. In fact several websites and blogs are quoting as fact that she's the Inconnue. Goto admits to feeling a little uncomfortable with his creation. "I'd assumed that people would have a postmodern view and treat it as fictional," he told me. "I really didn't expect them to take it seriously." But even if Ewa is an object lesson in not believing quite everything you read on the internet, it's unlikely that the story will go much further. What we love about the Inconnue is the uncertainty, the enigma. As Louise Welsh remarked when we returned from recording our search for this drowned Mona Lisa in Paris, the mask's value lies in its mystery. "The moment we have a name, a life story, that mystery is dead." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <title>Don't cut our expenses, say MPs</title>
      <description>A powerful group of MPs rejects a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses for hotels, second homes, TVs, taxis and tea and biscuits.</description>

      <body>A powerful MPs' group has rejected a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wants to ban claims for tea and biscuits and installing televisions in second homes. It also proposes cutting costs on hotel bills and evening meals. But the Commons Standards Committee insists that other professionals would be able to claim such expenses in compensation for unsociable hours. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up following the MPs' expenses scandal of 2009 and it has frequently come into conflict with those whose behaviour it was set up to police. In its latest report, it proposed MPs should get a £7,000 pay rise. But it said they should no longer be able to claim for: Ipsa says these perks cost the taxpayer £161,000 in 2011/12, about £250 per MP, and that most professional people would be expected to pay for them themselves. But the Standards Committee, in its formal submission to Ipsa's consultation, disagrees, saying MPs are like police, solicitors and junior doctors and should be able to claim expenses in compensation for "regular unsocial hours or residence away from home". It adds: "Practices vary widely within and between professions. In some professions there is indeed no reimbursement for unsocial hours and the associated costs of those hours but salaries may be supplemented to compensate." The committee is asking Ipsa to "establish an evidence base for the proposals", adding: "We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses." It says: "We find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 0100 before booking a hotel." On the curb on taxis before 2300, the committee says: "We are also concerned about the effects of such rules on members' ability to perform their duties effectively. "We note that many committees begin work at 08.55, and members are expected to attend regardless of the hour at which they ended their work the night before." And on the ban on claims for getting a TV installed, it says: "Since MPs' work involves being informed and available at virtually any hour, we consider access to media and the internet when residing away from home is a legitimate business expense." The consultation on the proposals - including the pay rise - ended on Sunday. Ipsa says it will announce its final decision on both pay and conditions before Christmas. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems showing 'school priorities'</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems are right to raise concerns about free schools in England as part of a pre-election drive to set out their own policies, a Cabinet minister says.</description>

      <body>The Lib Dems are right to raise concerns about free schools as part of a pre-election move to set out their priorities, a Cabinet minister says. Ed Davey suggested the party had backed aspects of education policy as a price of being in coalition with the Tories. It comes after Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the schools should employ only qualified teachers and adhere to the national curriculum. But the Conservatives have rejected calls for tighter controls. No 10 said the government's policy on free schools was clear and "there is no change to it". In a speech later this week, Mr Clegg will distance his party from part of the government's policy on free schools in England but has denied his comments represented a "great coalition crisis". Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but Mr Clegg is set to question this and other features of the schools which he will claim have been driven by Conservative "priorities". While insisting he continues to back the schools and will not interfere with education policy, Mr Clegg will insist that "core standards" of teaching and care must be met. Last week, the head teacher of a free primary school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the al-Madinah free school in Derby was judged by the education watchdog Ofsted to be "inadequate" in a number of areas. Mr Davey said told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his party leader was "right to say that when taxpayers are putting money into schools, they should expect minimum standards from the teachers". "People will be surprised we are embarking on a programme that could mean that lots of unqualified teachers are teaching our children," he added. Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position, saying that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Davey said it was not "surprising" that the Lib Dems and the Tories disagreed over aspects of education policy. Asked why Lib Dem ministers - including schools minister David Laws - had not spoken out earlier, Mr Davey said neither of the parties could have "their whole way" in a coalition and ministers were bound by collective responsibility to defend the agreed "government line". He added: "What Nick Clegg is showing is what our policy will be at the next election... "A party leader preparing for the next election and our manifesto, talking about party policies that have gone through a democratic vote at the Lib Dem conference. He has got to put those policies forward and he is right to do so." In a vote at the party's 2010 conference, Lib Dem activists rejected free schools and urged parents to boycott them, claiming they would worse educational outcomes for the majority of children and complicate admissions procedures. At the time, Lib Dem ministers made clear that "government policy was made by government ministers". Transport minister Baroness Kramer said she believed the public understood that Mr Clegg had a "dual role" as deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader, enabling him to talk about the party's future intentions as well as current policies. But Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Graham Stuart, the Conservative chair of the Commons Education Committee, said the Lib Dems' position was "strangely illiberal" and left Lib Dem schools minister Mr Laws in a "difficult position". "My understanding is that a typical Liberal view would be believing that you trust the front line to decide how and who should teach but you hold them strongly to account through exam results and Ofsted," he told Today. "I thought they believed in localism and, yet, here we are at the first sign of trouble and Nick Clegg comes over all Barbara Castle. It's a very peculiar approach." And Conservative peer Baroness Buscombe accused Mr Clegg of being "two-faced" and "grandstanding" in order to appeal to his party activists unhappy with some of the compromises of coalition. "Nick Clegg is trying to keep his head above water and appear big and strong," she told the BBC's Daily Politics. Labour, who have also been accused of changing their position, have said they would not close existing free schools but would not allow new ones to open under the government's existing model. Although parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local council control, local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. Shadow leader of the House of Lords Baroness Royall told the BBC that her party had sought guarantees on teacher qualifications when legislation authorising free schools was passed but the Lib Dems had opposed this. </body>

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>
      <description>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he tells the Daily Telegraph.</description>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster." Mr Doran was shadow minister for energy between 1988 and 1992, he has sat on the culture, media and sport select committee and has campaigned for improved safety in the North Sea. </body>

      <title>Drop siege mentality, says Robinson</title>
      <description>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality" during a speech to Castlereagh council.</description>

      <body>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality". He said they should move forward with nationalists to overcome the problems facing Northern Ireland. "Unionism has historically had a siege mentality," he said. "When we were being besieged it was the right response. But when we are in a constitutionally safe and stable position it poses a threat to our future development." Mr Robinson made his remarks in a speech to Castlereagh council on Friday. It came less than 24 hours after he acknowledged the efforts of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) to build better community relations in a symbolic address at Queen's University in Belfast. "Unionists and nationalists will face some big decisions in the next few months," added Mr Robinson. "We can get back on track to a shared and united community which can benefit everyone in Northern Ireland or we can go back to the 40-year conflict. There is no middle option." Reflecting on a troubled last 12 months, when disputes over flags, parades and commemorations erupted into street disorder and damaged community relations, the DUP leader said there was a need for more strategic thinking within unionism. He urged the unionist community not to let recent difficulties throw them off course from the ultimate objective of forging a "shared and united" society. Mr Robinson said there was no prospect of the assembly falling, but nevertheless warned that such a development would likely lead to an upsurge in paramilitary violence. Former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass is currently chairing talks in a bid to find solutions on the contentious issues of flags, parades and dealing with the past. While Mr Robinson's address included criticism of, and challenges to, nationalism and republicanism, its intended audience was unionism. He said the Union was stronger than ever, and cautioned unionists not to "turn the clock back to a bygone era" and urged them to have more self confidence. He said unionism should not be defined simply by the issues of "flags and parades" but by what he described as the benefits of living in the UK. "Unionism needs to think and act strategically," he said. "Adopting political strategies that will inevitably lead down a cul de sac is not politically courageous, it is politically crazy. Because if unionists are not seen to make Northern Ireland work within the Union then no one will. "Unionism will only succeed if it is a broad coalition of interests. I accept that not every person who wishes to remain part of the United Kingdom will share my affection for the national flag or even my cultural heritage. "My responsibility as leader of the largest unionist party is to seek to hold that broad coalition together for it is only the capacity to bring together those with differing views under a common banner that gives unionism its strength." The speech marked the installation of David Drysdale as mayor of Castlereagh. </body>

      <title>Welby urges energy firm 'generosity'</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <title>£250m children's hospital announced</title>
      <description>Northern Ireland Finance Minister Simon Hamilton has announced that a new children's hospital is to be built in Belfast.</description>

      <body>Northern Ireland Finance Minister Simon Hamilton has announced that a new children's hospital is to be built in Belfast. The £250m facility will replace the existing hospital on the Royal site in Belfast. The announcement was made as part of a reallocation of unspent funds, mainly from the stalled A5 road project. The Department of Health has been allocated £52m, £15.5m of which is to go towards the new hospital. It is expected to be completed by 2020/2021. The department has also been allocated £14m to address waiting lists. Mr Hamilton said he had recently visited the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and was "shocked and ashamed" by the conditions. Building on the new hospital could begin next year. Other health projects allocated money include: Mr Hamilton has also given the green light to dualling the Frosses Road section of the A26. "The allocations I have announced today will leave a lasting economic impact on Northern Ireland, boost our economy as the recovery gathers momentum and provide assistance for vulnerable people in our society," Mr Hamilton said. "I am especially pleased that we are able to fund a new regional children's hospital and significant strategic roads improvements." Health Minister Edwin Poots said the money would help provide services fit for the 21st century for children. "A replacement regional children's hospital is a major project that I have been keen to take forward, particularly as parts of the current facilities are nearly 100 years old," he said. "Securing this additional funding from the executive provides me with the opportunity to move this much needed project forward to ensure that our children will receive their care and treatment in a modern paediatric environment." </body>

      <title>Union rejects teaching changes</title>
      <description>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions</description>

      <body>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions. EIS members voted against the changes by 59% to 41% in a consultative ballot. The proposals included greater flexibility over working, and changes to the things teachers should and should not be responsible for. There were also some changes to the list of agreed duties of things which should or should not be done by teachers. The EIS expects the current pay offer for teachers to now be withdrawn. The proposed changes were negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) following the publication of the McCormac Report on teacher employment. Among the proposals were greater flexibility over working time. For example a teacher might spend two hours more with students one week but have two hours less the next to balance this out. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has been consistent in stating that any proposals arising from discussion of the McCormac report would be subject to a ballot of our members. "We have now completed that process and the result is a clear rejection by Scotland's teachers of the suggested changes to working conditions. "As always, the EIS is listening to its members and will make teachers' views known to the management side at the forthcoming meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers". The union said the rejection of the proposed changes to working conditions is also likely to have an impact on the agreed 1% pay offer for teachers in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Local government body Cosla had indicated that the 1% pay offer could be withdrawn if teachers rejected the changes to working conditions. The current pay offer also included improvements to the payment for short term supply teachers, a move being funded by Scottish government. Mr Flanagan added: "We will be seeking constructive dialogue with both Cosla and Scottish government on what happens next. "No one wishes to see disruption in our schools, particularly at such a crucial phase in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, so we will await discussion of the issues at the SNCT before deciding how to proceed. "The ballot result, however, is indicative of the mood of teachers who after a two year pay freeze, increased pension contributions and in the face of excessive workload have simply said, 'Enough is enough.'" Councillor Billy Hendry, Cosla's human resources spokesman, said: "Firstly I am disappointed with the outcome of the EIS ballot. Secondly I am very disappointed that our teaching workforce will now not have their back dated pay in their pay packets before Christmas. "The simple fact is that as employers we have put together the very best components of an offer in agreement with the unions and the Scottish government. "The offer is a package and is not open to any one of the three parties to cherry pick the bits that they like best and reject the rest. "This offer remains on the table and will do so during our meeting with the EIS tomorrow."  </body>

      <title>Enterprise zone jobs 'in pipeline'</title>
      <description>The first minister says there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones, as he also announces 100 new jobs in the Cardiff zone.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70612000/png/_70612440_vlcsnap-2013-10-21-13h43m13s126.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The first minister has said there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones. Carwyn Jones' comments came as he announced accountancy firm Deloitte will create 100 jobs in the Cardiff zone over the next three years. He also announced a cut in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Welsh Conservatives say the enterprise zones still have "a long way to go". At his monthly press conference, the first minister defended his Welsh government's enterprise zone policy saying they "are the envy of the rest of the UK". There are seven enterprise zones in Wales, each dedicated to nurture specific industries. Companies have access to a range of benefits, including business rate relief, enhanced capital allowances, skills support, superfast broadband, bespoke infrastructure projects and simplified planning rules. Carwyn Jones said almost 2,000 jobs have been created across the seven zones, with a further 6,500 planned, 3,000 of them in the Cardiff zone. Located in the centre of the capital, a further 100 jobs are set to be created in the zone dedicated to financial services as financial advisory firm Deloitte's is set to expand. Deloitte will set up the Cardiff Centre of Excellence to support its International Assignment Services, helping employers meet tax compliance. The Welsh government has invested £170,000 into the project, which will centralise client administration and support. Carwyn Jones welcomed the news at the firm's Cardiff headquarters. "This latest expansion which is set to create 100 jobs in Cardiff sends out a strong message that Wales is becoming the location of choice for companies operating in the professional and financial services sector that are looking to grow their business," he said. "I am hugely encouraged that Cardiff has been selected and confident this latest project will build on the success of their quality and risk operations team in Cardiff. "Wales is the first place in the UK with an enterprise zone dedicated to this sector and Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone is helping to enhance the city's position as a capital location for professional business services." Shadow Minister for Business Nick Ramsay AM, said: "This is extremely welcome news - and long overdue. "Progress on the Labour government's enterprise zone in Cardiff has been disappointingly slow - and today's announcement is a step in the right direction. "In the two years since this zone's announcement, very little has been announced and very few details released. "There is a long way to go on every enterprise zone in Wales and I am pleased that some progress is finally being made." The first minister also announced SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment bank. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to look at the bank's interest rates more widely. Eluned Parrott AM, said: "This announcement will be welcomed by small and medium sized businesses planning on investing in Enterprise Zones, however, questions still have to be answered as to why Finance Wales's interest rates are higher than they need to be across the country. "I do hope that the Welsh Government will look seriously at the interest rates it is offering through Finance Wales across the country, and take action to ensure that its rates are comparable with the market not unnecessarily expensive for companies who are trying to create wealth and encourage growth." The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the announcement raises some questions. FSB Welsh Policy Unit chair Janet Jones said: "The announcement of a 2% cut in rates from Finance Wales for businesses in Welsh enterprise zones is welcome, but rather perplexing. "The Welsh government's own report into access to finance by Professor Dylan Jones-Evans noted that Finance Wales' interest rates were often well above their regulatory requirements. "FSB Wales agrees with that assessment, and this announcement suggests that there is more flexibility in Finance Wales' setting of its interest rates than was previously stated. "In the light of this announcement we would call for Finance Wales to re-examine its rates as it appears that state aid rules do not require rates to be as high as they are at present," she added. </body>

      <body>Yorkshire politician Godfrey Bloom has revealed he was ordered by UKIP's leaders to postpone the planned launch of his autobiography on the eve of the party conference a month ago as they thought it so controversial it would overshadow the event. As it turned out the 63-year-old maverick MEP did not need his book, entitled Guinea A Minute, to do exactly that. A recording from the conference emerged of him joking that a group of UKIP women who did not clean behind their fridges were "sluts". In the weeks since then he has hurriedly added a new chapter to the original manuscript attempting to explain recent events which left him defending himself against allegations of racism and sexism. The chapter, "Bongos, Boobs and Sluts", probably does just as much to reinforce the views of those that accuse him of blindly refusing to accept that his views are several decades behind the times and cause offence to many. Even his famously "anti-political correctness" party have had enough. Suspension followed his antics at the conference in September and within a few days he had no alternative but to announce that he would not stand for re-election at next year's polls and intends to spend the months until then sitting as an independent Euro MP for the Yorkshire and Humber region. At a launch party at a pub in East Yorkshire even a cursory flip through a copy of his autobiography explained that the "boobs" in his additional chapter's title was not a reference to any mistakes he might have made by his behaviour. Selections from his personal photo album included a prominent picture of him with his face between the naked breasts of a stripper. It had been taken more than 30 years ago as the then bachelor celebrated his forthcoming nuptials with a bawdy stag night at a "gentleman's club". In his book, Godfrey Bloom makes it absolutely clear he sees nothing wrong with his behaviour then or now. For leaders of a party trying desperately to shrug off an image of being run by ageing dinosaurs desperately trying to tap into mainstream electoral support it was yet another disastrous headline waiting to happen. It is no surprise that he concludes in his book: "I already knew my days with the party must be numbered." So what now for Godfrey Bloom? At the launch party he told me he had turned down approaches to appear on "Strictly Come Dancing" and "I'm a Celebrity..." But his wife did reveal that he has been known to cut quite a figure on the dance floor. "But who knows what might happen in the next six months or so," he told me as he stood, pint in hand, surrounded by UKIP party faithful who were buying multiple signed copies of his book. Godfrey Bloom's autobiography 'Guinea A Minute' is published by Grosvenor House Publishing. </body>

      <title>Loan companies 'preying on the poor'</title>
      <description>A new study calls for action after finding payday and doorstep lenders were "preying on the poor".</description>

      <body>Eleanor Eamens started off borrowing £100 from a doorstep lender to help with the cost of Christmas. Soon she ended up with six separate loans, owing the lender £4,000. The mum from Belford in Northumberland found the £50-a-week payments impossible on her income, forcing her to choose between servicing the debt and feeding her five children. But even towards the end when she was missing payments, the company continued to offer her loans. She said: "I take responsibility for what I did. Nobody forced me to borrow the money, but when you are on a small income it's so tempting. "They did not ever look if I had other debts or whether I could afford it on my income. They simply didn't have a clue." And a new study carried out in the North East has found that Eleanor Eamens' experience was all too common of low income households. Durham University worked with 24 families in Middlesbrough and Stockton. Many didn't have a bank account, and the ones that did were only allowed basic services with no access to an overdraft or credit card. The most any of the families had in savings was £4, yet their debts ranged from £340 to £10,000. Many had multiple loans with payday and doorstep lenders, at annual interest rates of up to 4,000% even though their incomes were small. Professor Sarah Banks, who led the study, says this had a profound and negative impact on their lives. She said: "It was quick and convenient to get the loans, but very soon people were finding themselves saddled with large debts. "Many were desperate, some had moved home, others had gone off incognito to try and get away from the debt and many had mental health problems which were quite severe." The researchers believe these families were preyed upon by lenders even though they clearly couldn't afford the debt. Professor Banks believes there needs to be a cap on the amount loaned to individuals and greater checks on their ability to pay. She said: "The companies were purely interested in getting more customers and not in whether people could pay it back. They charge huge rates and built into those rates is the assumption that they will default. "We want all these high cost credit companies to carry out affordability checks. If people can't afford them they shouldn't really be offered the loans." And the pressure does seem to be ramping up on high cost credit companies. The government is planning tighter regulation of the industry from next April, but Labour has gone a step further by backing some form of cap, and promising a levy on the firms. That money will then be used to help develop community credit unions to provide low cost alternatives. But some believe the idea is unworkable. Phil Hall from the ifs University College, which specialises in financial education, says credit unions will never be a substitute because they require people to save before they can lend He also believes the high cost credit industry is already well-supervised. He said: "The fixation with huge APR rates for payday lenders is very misleading because APRs are annual, payday loans are not. Often it is cheaper to borrow from a payday lender than to dip into an unauthorised overdraft or to take out a lengthy bank loan but these basic facts appears to be lost on policymakers. "The government should be cracking down on illegal lending and loan sharks rather than directing misguided attention to what is already a well regulated market." And those who work in the industry believe they provide a vital service. Julio Martino runs a local payday loan shop in Newcastle. He says he does check people's ability to pay and charges realistic interest rates. He said: "I think it is important businesses do not charge ridiculous interest rates but we do have to charge a rate that allows us to make money. We are not a bank, or building society or a huge financial organisation so we cannot charge APRs similar to credit cards. "We are essentially lending to people who cannot get credit from banks, and companies like mine are willing to take a slightly greater risk to lend to these people who do need credit." But the researchers at Durham University believe people can be given help to avoid unmanageable debt. They worked with community organisation Thrive Teesside to provide mentors for low income families to guide them. That helped many, and some now do use credit unions. Eleanor Eamens has also drawn a line under her loans. She'll be debt-free by January and has begun saving with her local credit union. She says she'll never go back to high cost credit. But with the high cost credit industry worth many hundreds of millions of pounds, will it ever be possible - or even desirable - to wean people off the payday and doorstep lender? </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <description>Examining the tensions over whether free schools are too free</description>

      <body>Should free schools be forced to employ only teachers whose qualifications are approved by Whitehall, to teach only in line with the national curriculum and to feed children only if the food meets national guidelines? Yes, says Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. No, says Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove. But what does his deputy, the schools minister David Laws - a Liberal Democrat - think? His is the one voice which has been missing over a weekend of controversy. I'm glad to say that he joins me on the line now*: Q: Can you clear up the confusion about whether free schools are too free to do what they like? A: There really isn't any confusion. You should pay more attention in class. Q: Well, let's see by starting with those unqualified teachers. Should free schools be barred from employing them? A: There are plenty of teachers who may not have formal qualifications but who still do a superb job. We are ensuring, through the Ofsted inspection process, that every single teacher has the capability to teach. All classes are assessed for quality, and that is the right way to ensure a backstop of high standards.** Q: Well that's clear enough. So, why did your leader - the man you're writing a manifesto for - say something quite different? A: Hold on. You didn't ask me the question as a Liberal Democrat. You asked me as a minister. Q: Are you suggesting that would make a difference? A: Well, why don't you try me? Q: OK then - speaking as a Lib Dem should free schools be barred from employing unqualified teachers? A: Yes. Our party opposes the use of unqualified teachers as Nick Clegg made perfectly clear. Q: So you're opposed to an idea that you're implementing as schools minister? A: No, I back government education policy at all times. I just think it should be different. Q: So, will you change the policy? A: We would change it after the next election, which is what Nick Clegg is saying in his big speech on education this week and what I will be saying when I write the Lib Dem manifesto. Q: So, you want voters to know that you're opposed to some of the things you're doing in government? A: That's it. You've got it. It wasn't that complicated was it? Q: One last question before you go. Wasn't Nick Clegg educated in a rather good school with lots of unqualified teachers? A: He was and I have heard him say how excellent they were but state schools are very different. Q: In what way? A: Because you have to get elected to run them and saying you're against unqualified teachers in state schools is very popular and makes you look different from those posh, ideological Tories. Minister, thank you. I think that clears things up. * This is, as I hope is obvious, an imaginary interview. ** This is a direct quote from David Laws in the House of Commons on Thursday. </body>

      <title>Europe's discontent</title>
      <description>Worries over jobs and migrants boost Eurosceptic cause</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24607866</url>

      <body>The election campaign for the European Parliament has begun. It is not that hopeful candidates are already making their pitches to the voters, but the political battleground for next May's contest is being shaped. The elections will be fought against a background of Europe's discontent. That was underlined yet again at the weekend when a poll for the Financial Times found that "hostility to EU migrants seeking work and benefits is now entrenched in the bloc's biggest economies". And on the question of whether the EU would do better with fewer powers, two-thirds of Britons agreed but, more surprisingly, so did half of Germans and nearly half of Spanish voters. A few weeks ago, a poll for Debating Europe found a majority of Europeans believe that the austerity measures pursued since the start of the crisis have failed. A few months earlier, the Pew Institute discovered that approval ratings for the EU and its institutions have fallen sharply - in almost every country except Germany. In France, only 41% had a favourable view of the EU, which was less than the UK. The political consensus behind the European project is fracturing. It is quite possible that come next May, 170 MEPs out of a total of 751 will be broadly questioning of or even hostile towards the European establishment. The main reason for Europe's discontent is the economy. Even though the acute phase of the eurozone crisis has passed, next year, three of the five largest economies in Europe, according to the IMF, will register tepid growth at best. "Europe's leaders are currently in a race against time, hoping that economic conditions will improve fast enough before an anti-reform and anti-EU backlash undermines the whole single currency project," says Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. But economic insecurity is fuelling unease over immigration and migration between EU countries. Anti-establishment parties are tapping into this wider disquiet and voters no longer necessarily believe the Commission's interpretation of figures. The political sensitivity of all this was in full display at the weekend in France, with the government and the president twisting and turning over the case of 15-year-old Leonarda Dibrani. She had been detained whilst on a school trip and later deported to Kosovo after her family had failed to win asylum. The expulsion of Leonarda had brought "les jeunes" (the youth) on to the streets in protest. French President Francois Hollande, facing pressure from all sides, came up with a formula that satisfied almost no-one. He said that Leonarda could return to school in eastern France on the condition she come back alone without her family. The president was accused of splitting families, but instant polls revealed that two-thirds of the French public do not want Leonarda to return. The government, in taking a robust stance, is aware of the growing support for the right-wing National Front. Much attention has recently been focused on the tragic journeys of migrants crossing from Africa to the Italian island of Lampedusa. My colleagues have been monitoring the speed with which arrivals now move through Europe. In Italy, where they are supposed to be processed, many are allowed to travel north without having been fingerprinted and without documents. Rules are bent or ignored in the hope that migrants will move north to places like Sweden where they will get a better welcome. The aim is to make the new arrivals disappear off the news agendas as soon as possible. Polls suggest deep disapproval of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens being able from next January to work in any member state and yet that is one of the EU's main freedoms. In a thoughtful essay on the European elections for the Centre for European Reform, Heather Grabbe and Stefan Lehne recognise that the European Parliament is still not "accepted as an essential party of the body politic". They understand the call for democratic legitimacy, but do not believe the answer lies in allowing the parliament's political groupings to essentially nominate the next head of the European Commission. They argue that not only could it lead to a partisan president, but that it will not cut much ice with the voters. They suggest the election campaign should focus on what the EU has done well, the single market, freedom to travel, etc. They would like to see the argument of the anti-establishment parties confronted head-on. "The reality is that there is no going back to autonomous national policies for the economy or migration," the authors say. They want to remind voters that "going back" would lead to higher prices and make travel more difficult. So the battleground is being prepared. The European establishment is determined to make the election about the future of Europe. They will ask voters to decide whether they want to turn back the page and to sacrifice what has been achieved. Ranged against them will be parties who will argue that austerity has led to mass poverty in southern Europe, that budgets and policies are being set by remote masters and that Brussels is insensitive to fears about migration and immigration. The months ahead will see fierce debates about the future of the European project. </body>

      <title>Defence chief admits huge challenges</title>
      <description>Britain's new top general on the future of the armed forces</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24605083</url>

      <body>The new Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Nick Houghton, says he has taken over at a time of "huge challenges". The UK's most senior military officer told the BBC the armed forces had shown great resilience in recent years. But Gen Houghton said it was too soon to judge the recruitment levels to the reserves, which are running at around half the planned levels. He is responsible for implementing cuts to the Army, while ensuring the Afghanistan withdrawal goes smoothly. UK troops are continuing to fight a campaign in Afghanistan, while preparing to withdraw - at the same time as reducing the number of regulars by 20,000 and bringing back troops based in Germany. Gen Houghton, an Oxford University history graduate and former Green Howard, is now the nation's most senior military officer and professional head of the armed forces. He is responsible for implementing the many simultaneous changes flowing from the Strategic Defence Review in 2010. The review cut 8% from the MoD's already stretched budget. In his first broadcast interview, Gen Houghton said: "If you just look at what the Army is being asked to do in terms of continuing to fight a campaign, to withdraw and downscale its numbers by 20,000 regulars, to bring 20,000 of its people back from Germany, to restructure, to build up the strength of the reserves, and during all this, take other things like public duties and Olympic security in its stride, yes, these are huge challenges." So what impact is this having on the armed forces, particularly on morale? "In terms of morale, it's not about individual happiness," he said. "It is about the ability to endure in times of real austerity, endure through times of hostility, in times of pressure. "And I think if anything has demonstrated the resilience of the morale of the British armed forces, it is the last couple of years - and the fact they still continue to perform, and are one of our nation's unique selling points." One of the tasks at the top of the agenda is the plan to continue cutting regulars in the Army to 82,000 from 102,000, while trying to increase the number of reservists from 19,000 to 30,000. Last week, MPs passed a motion that noted concerns about the government's defence reforms "in relation to whether its proposals for the reserve forces will deliver either the anticipated cost savings or defence capability". So with the current recruitment of reservists lagging well behind target, would he advise the government to think again? Gen Houghton said: "Well, I think this is more an argument in Parliament than it is one within the armed forces. "You can't compare these 82,000 regulars of the 21st Century with Victorian figures. These are 82,000 regulars, the vast percentage of which are deployable capability, not mess waiters or guards. "It's a force that's networked by modern communications. Private soldiers are connected to close air support and artillery fires. The capability of soldiers nowadays are transformed from what they were even a decade ago". "But of course, size is important, and that is why the reserves provide an essential and cost-effective mechanism of maintaining resilience." On the level of reservist recruitment so far, Gen Houghton insists it is too early to make a judgement. "We think that we have produced a good offer. We've got to get out the message that people who join now are joining something that is exciting, will give them all sorts of rewards and has a very, very strong future." However, after the Parliamentary vote on Syria that rejected UK military action, how does he see their role today? "Well, I think the message is that we've got to be quite hard-nosed about defining what the core national interest is when we want to use our armed forces, and the utility of doing so." That does not rule out military action abroad, but it may well be of a rather different sort from Iraq and Afghanistan. "We want to influence, to use our unique access in all sorts of countries to build capacity, to stabilise, and prevent conflict," Gen Houghton explains, "as well as being the 'go-to' organisation for domestic crisis, whether it's fire strikes, foot and mouth, or Olympic security." First, though, British combat forces must perform an orderly exit from Afghanistan by the end of next year after 12 years and 445 British lives lost. What is his verdict? "You've got to really take a strategic look," Gen Houghton said. "The United Kingdom has been part of an international effort to maintain the integrity of Afghanistan, to give that country the chance of looking after its own security, having a democratic process that elects the next president, that has the prospect of some prosperity and has not been the source of international terrorism. So I would deem that success." </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Migrants and asylum in the EU</title>
      <description>What are the pressures on Europe from non-EU migrants fleeing war and poverty?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24583286</url>

      <body>The arrival of boatloads of poor and desperate migrants in Europe has put pressure on the EU to find a solution. Hundreds of non-EU migrants have drowned off the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa this month, after fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. How big is the migration challenge affecting Europe now? There is no doubt that the Arab Spring has put new migration pressures on Europe, swelling the numbers of people prepared to risk their lives by crossing the Mediterranean in rickety, overcrowded boats. In 2011 the big challenge was thousands of Tunisians arriving on Lampedusa. Later it was thousands of sub-Saharan Africans fleeing the conflict in Libya. Now it is the wave of Syrians fleeing the vicious civil war in their country. Italy and Malta have appealed for more help from the EU - not for the first time. Before this summer the focus was more on Greece, because its land border with Turkey had become the biggest crossing point for illegal migrants entering the EU. The Italian government says 35,085 migrants came ashore in Italy in January-October this year, of whom 73% met the legal criteria for asylum. Lampedusa is a migrant bottleneck because it is tiny and lies closer to North Africa than to Italy itself. Italy is expanding its reception centres to a 16,000 capacity, from the current 3,000. It had closed temporary camps for migrants from war-torn Libya at the end of 2012, after the defeat of Libyan ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi. Italy's problems are shared by some of its Mediterranean neighbours. Reception centres in Greece and Malta are overcrowded and under-resourced. Both countries have been criticised by the UN refugee agency UNHCR and human rights groups, who accuse them of violating migrants' rights. There are plenty of other routes taken by irregular migrants to enter the EU and start a new life. Mainland Greece remains a major transit point - many migrants travel up through the Balkans, hoping to reach northern Europe. Many illegal migrants go undetected, so there is no overall figure for them. But in 2012 there were 344,928 detections of illegal stay in the EU, according to the EU border agency Frontex. It calls the trend "generally stable". How does the Mediterranean compare with other entry points? In 2012 the Eastern Mediterranean route - via Greece - accounted for the most detections of illegal border-crossing. There were 37,214 detections (51% of the total). But in August 2012 the numbers trying to get in that way began to fall after Greece, helped by Frontex police, beefed up security on its land border with Turkey. The figure for the Central Mediterranean route - via Italy - rose to 10,379 (14% of the total). Before the Arab Spring the Western Mediterranean route was a big challenge for Spain, as many migrant boats arrived off the Canary Islands, carrying poor sub-Saharan Africans. Since then Spain has tightened up border co-operation with Morocco and has erected fortifications around its North African enclaves - Ceuta and Melilla. In 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing totalled 6,397 on the route to Spain. People traffickers also smuggle migrants into the EU via Eastern Europe, often hiding in lorries. The numbers entering that way are smaller. Some are victims of sexual exploitation, often from the former Soviet Union. But Germany has also seen a surge in the numbers of Chechens fleeing Russia and claiming asylum. Where do most of the migrants come from? On the Central Mediterranean route this year the largest numbers have been Syrians and Eritreans, followed by Somalis. War is raging in Somalia and Syria, and Italian officials believe many of the migrants are genuine asylum seekers, fleeing persecution. In the case of Eritrea, it appears many are young men fleeing compulsory military service, which has been likened to slavery. Eritrea is blighted by political repression, human rights groups say. In 2012 the largest number of asylum applications in the EU came from Afghans - 28,010. The other major countries of origin were Russia (24,285), Syria (21,100), Pakistan (19,685), Serbia (19,060) and Somalia (14,270). It is important to remember that huge numbers of EU citizens move from one EU country to another freely. They are also described as "migrants", but they are fully protected by EU law, unless they are fugitive criminals. Their status is quite different from that of non-EU migrants. In some EU countries, including the UK, they have become an issue because of pressure on social services and competition for jobs. Most EU countries are in the Schengen zone, which has made it much easier to cross borders without having to show a passport or other papers. How is the EU reacting to the current migrant problem? For years the EU has been struggling to harmonise asylum policy. That is difficult with 28 member states, each with their own police force and judiciary. More detailed joint rules have been brought in with the Common European Asylum System - but rules are one thing, putting them into practice EU-wide is another challenge. The Dublin Regulation is a core principle for handling asylum claims in the EU. It says responsibility for examining the claim lies primarily with the member state which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry or residence in the EU. Often that is the first EU country that the migrant reached - but not always, as in many cases migrants want to be reunited with family members, for example in the UK or the Netherlands. There are tensions in the EU over the Dublin Regulation - Greece complained that it was inundated with applications, as so many migrants arrived in Greece first. Finland and Germany are among several countries that have stopped sending migrants back to Greece. The EU also has the Eurodac system - a common database of asylum seekers' fingerprints, which can be accessed under strict controls. Police use it to intercept false or multiple claims. The European Commission has urged EU governments to expand the Mediterranean surveillance operation "from Spain to Cyprus", to prevent more boat tragedies. Frontex has only a few aircraft and boats off Italy - the agency's entire annual budget is 86m euros (£73m; $118m). Italy is stepping up its maritime patrols and the EU has agreed to launch a data exchange system in December, called Eurosur, to detect illegal migrant boats faster. How do migrants get asylum status in the EU? They have to satisfy the authorities that they are fleeing persecution and would face harm or even death if sent back to their country of origin. International law provides that protection for genuine refugees. The ban on mass "push-backs" - also known as "non-refoulement" - is an EU principle. In some cases it has not been respected, however. Before the Libya uprising the Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi routinely prevented migrant boats coming ashore, without processing asylum seekers. Greece has been accused of similar actions in the past. Under EU rules, an asylum seeker has the right to food, first aid and shelter in a reception centre. They should get an individual assessment of their needs. They can apply for asylum after giving fingerprints and being interviewed by a trained case worker. They may be granted asylum by the authorities at "first instance". If unsuccessful they can appeal against the decision in court, and may win. Asylum seekers are supposed to be granted the right to a job within nine months of arrival. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says there is still too much variation in the way EU states handle asylum claims. For example, the recognition rate for Sudanese asylum seekers is 2% in Spain, but 68% in Italy, the Commission says. How many asylum applications are successful? In 2012 there were 335,365 asylum applications in the EU - a rise on 2011. Germany ranked first, handling a quarter of the total applications. Nearly three-quarters of first instance rulings were negative, so just over a quarter of the applications were successful. Of the successful ones, 52% got refugee status - granted for those who have fled persecution. The others got "subsidiary protection" - meaning they would not be sent back, as that would put them in danger. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. The government believes it needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions. Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget. The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer. Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years. In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists. Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation. Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so. The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn). The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects. This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden. The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects. EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit. </body>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become un-useable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <body>A browser-based re-creation of the popular Super Mario Brothers console game has fallen foul of Nintendo's copyright lawyers, The Washington Post has reported. College student Josh Goldberg created the Full Screen Mario site in HTML 5 so people could play the game in a web browser rather than on a games console. But Nintendo has asked him to remove the content saying it infringes its "intellectual property rights". The game is still operational. Mr Goldberg, who admitted he did not get permission from Nintendo to re-create the game, said he began the project in October 2012 as a computer programming exercise. He "didn't care" about copyright issues because he "didn't think it would be a big project", he told the newspaper. But after little initial interest the game is now receiving 300,000 unique visitors a day, Mr Goldberg claims, after Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow blogged about it. Unfortunately for Mr Goldberg, the site's popularity also brought it to the attention of Nintendo's lawyers. "Nintendo's like Disney - it will not tolerate their characters being used on anything," said Keza MacDonald, UK games editor for IGN.com, the video game and entertainment site. "Earlier this year Nintendo stopped people posting footage of their games on YouTube, so this behaviour sounds entirely consistent." At the bottom of the site's home page the site declares: "Mario, Super Mario Brothers, and all associated games and media are property of Nintendo and/or Nintendo of America Inc., and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws." Super Mario Brothers was copyrighted by Nintendo in 1985, but under US law, corporate copyright lasts for 95 years. </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>French outrage over US spying claims</title>
      <description>France summons the US ambassador over claims in Le Monde newspaper that the US routinely spied on millions of phone calls in France.</description>

      <body>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has summoned the US ambassador over newspaper claims that the US spied on millions of phone calls in France. France has labelled such activity between allies as "unacceptable". Le Monde says the data, based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, suggest the US NSA agency monitored businesses and officials as well as terrorism suspects. The intercepts were apparently triggered by certain key words. The paper says the National Security Agency (NSA) spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France in just 30 days between December 10 last year and January 8, 2013. The agency also apparently captured millions of text messages. It was unclear whether the content of the calls and messages was stored, or just the metadata - the details of who is speaking to whom. And the paper did not say whether the operation, codenamed US-985D, was still in progress. Mr Fabius announced that he had summoned the US ambassador to discuss the claims "immediately". Interior Minister Manuel Valls had earlier said the allegations were "shocking", and added: "If an allied country spies on France, this is totally unacceptable." The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says the outrage is largely for public consumption, because the French government has been accused of running its own snooping operation similar to the US. Le Monde reported in July that the French government stores vast amounts of personal data of its citizens on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the DGSE intelligence service. Connections inside France and between France and other countries were all monitored, Le Monde reported. Emails, text messages, telephone and internet browsing records are stored for years, it said. The latest revelations follow claims in the German media that US agents hacked into the email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Edward Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Ship trackers 'vulnerable to hacks'</title>
      <description>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacks and exploitation, security experts warn.</description>

      <body>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacking, security experts have warned. Weaknesses in outdated systems could allow attackers to make ships disappear from tracking systems - or even make it look like a large fleet was incoming. Researchers at Trend Micro said their findings showed the danger of using legacy systems designed when security was not an issue. But one vessel-tracking specialist said spoof attempts could be easily spotted. Lloyd's List Intelligence's Ian Trowbridge said that in addition to the vulnerable technology - known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) - other measures could be used to identify marine activity. "The spoofing would immediately be identified by [Lloyd's List Intelligence] as a warp vessel," he said, "providing unexplained position reports outside of the vessel's speed/distance capability and thus subject to further investigation and validation." The AIS system is used to track the whereabouts of ships travelling across the world's oceans. For ships over a certain size, having AIS fitted is mandatory under international maritime law. It is designed to transmit data about a ship's position, as well as other relevant information, so that movements can be seen by other boats as well as relevant authorities on shore. One other use is to alert nearby ships when a man or woman is overboard - an alert that can easily be spoofed, says Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson. "It boils down to the fact that the protocol was never designed with security in mind," he told the BBC. "There's no validity checking of what's being put up there." Using equipment bought for 700 euros (£600), the researchers were able to intercept signals and make vessels appear on the tracking system, even though they did not exist. In one example, the team was able to make it look as if a ship's route had spelled out the word "pwned" - hacker slang for "owned". The information broadcast by AIS is public - but when the system was first put in use, in the early 1990s, the technology required to receive the information was prohibitively expensive for those not directly involved in the industry. But now, a typical internet connection can be used to see the locations of boats, as well as an indicator of what type of cargo they may be carrying. There has been speculation that Somali pirates have been making use of the system. "It has long been thought that the pirates are basically using AIS as a shopping list," Mr Ferguson said, "seeing what's coming into local waters, and what cargo it may have." However, Lloyd's List Intelligence noted that captains are permitted to disable AIS if they feel their crew could be endangered by it. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>AT&amp;T agrees $4.85bn tower deal</title>
      <description>US telecom giant AT&amp;T has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International.</description>

      <body>US telecom giant ATandT has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International. ATandT will receive nearly $4.85bn (£3bn) in cash upfront as part of the deal. The deal gives ATandT cash to fund a new share buyback announced earlier this year, as well as a multi-billion dollar plan to upgrade its wireless and high-speed internet networks. It has also hinted that it is looking at making acquisitions in Europe. "This deal will let us monetise our towers while giving us the ability to add capacity as we need it," Bill Hogg, a senior vice-president with ATandT said in a statement. "And we'll get additional financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders." The deal is the latest such move by a US telecom operator. Last year, T-Mobile USA agreed to sell the rights to operate 7,200 cellular towers to Crown Castle for $2.4bn. Mobile operators can free up cash and focus on more profitable areas of their business by leasing or selling their towers. Meanwhile, specialist operators tend to lease the capacity on the towers to multiple operators in an attempt to maximise their profits. According to the latest deal, ATandT will sublease capacity on the towers from Crown Castle for a minimum of 10 years for $1,900 per month per site, with annual rent increases of 2%. Crown Castle said in a statement that it "will have the right to sublease other available capacity on the towers to additional tenants and believes the ATandT towers have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one additional tenant per tower". It added that nearly half of the towers were "located in the top 50 markets, where we expect the majority of network densification and upgrade activity to occur". Under the terms of the deal, Crown Castle will have exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 9,100 ATandT towers. The average term of the lease rights is about 28 years and Crown Castle will have the option to purchase the leased towers for about $4.2bn as the leases expire. </body>

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24579776</url>
      <date>1382097398</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70563000/jpg/_70563333_hi019302373.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can act as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "The Coverage Checker offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <title>Google shares hit record highs</title>
      <description>Recovering from a surprising miss last quarter, Google reports a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations.</description>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is 6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

      <body>Britain's changing weather patterns have resulted in an increase in the number of landslides in recent years as the result of heavy summer and winter rainfall. Geologists from the British Geological Survey have been measuring landslides across the UK for almost 30 years and have created a database of every landslide reported. Inside Out's Marie Ashby meets the team based in Nottinghamshire which is using technology to predict future landslides to help reduce the risk of disasters. Recent events including a road slippage in Rothbury, Northumberland and a railway landslip at Stainforth, South Yorkshire illustrate the impact of landslips on communities. The collapse of a section of cliffs in Dorset also claimed the life of Charlotte Blackman from Derbyshire when she was on holiday a year ago. It is hoped new technology will allow the British Geological Survey team to link geology and weather to produce a daily landslide forecast and prevent similar accidents. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One East Midlands on Monday, 21 October at 19:30 GMT and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>
      <date>1381823426</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70483000/jpg/_70483141_untitled-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <body>A Wolves fan who missed his first home game since 1976 to attend his stepdaughter's wedding is to be presented to the next home crowd to "mark his loyalty and support". Peter Abbott, from Ipswich, missed Saturday's match but will be back in Wolverhampton for Tuesday's fixture. The club sent its record goalscorer Steve Bull to the wedding as a surprise when it heard he would miss the match. It now intends to make a presentation to him on the pitch at the next match. Mr Abbott has been a fan of League One Wolverhampton Wanderers since 1970 and the last home match he missed was against Tottenham on 16 March 1976. He regularly makes the 330-mile (530km) round trip to the Molineux ground to see his team, but had to follow Saturday's 1-1 draw with Coventry by text, while attending the family wedding. He said he was "gutted" when he first realised the wedding of stepdaughter Sarah Butler and Jonathan Liddle coincided with the game. However, Wolves heard of his plight and decided to send Steve "Bully" Bull along with a signed shirt and programme from the match, to "soften the blow". Mr Abbott said it was "a big surprise" and described Bull as "a legend". Paul Richards, Wolves' supporter liaison officer, said: "We were only too happy to work with the sponsors... in getting Bully to attend the reception on Saturday, and are pleased it helped make Peter's day." He added: "There are many [fans] with great stories about how many games they have attended, but I'm not sure any can match the achievement of Peter in not missing a home game in 34 years. "We now want to mark his continuing loyalty and support of the club by making a presentation to him during half-time of Tuesday night's Oldham game. "In typical Peter fashion, he has already warned us that after being away from Molineux on Saturday, he doesn't want to miss a single second of the game so we must have him back in his seat well in advance of the start of the second half." </body>

      <title>Triple killer gets life sentence</title>
      <description>A convicted killer who murdered a man going to the aid of a neighbour in a Hertfordshire village is jailed for life.</description>

      <body>A triple killer who admitted the fatal stabbing of a man in a Hertfordshire village has been jailed for life. Ian John McLoughlin, 55, pleaded guilty to the murder of Graham Buck, 66, in Little Gaddesden, last July, while he was a day release prisoner. Mr Buck was stabbed when he went to help his neighbour, Francis Cory-Wright, 86, who was being robbed. Sentencing McLoughlin at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Sweeney said he must serve a minimum of 40 years. McLoughlin was on day release from prison where he was serving a life term for the murder of Brighton barman Peter Halls, whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992. He had previously been jailed for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, 49, in 1984, whom he hit over the head with a hammer after a row, before leaving his body in a cupboard. Mr Justice Sweeney said that he was barred from passing a whole life term because of a European judgment that those sentences are in breach of human rights. The court heard McLouglin turned up at Mr Cory-Wright's house claiming to need help setting up a charity supporting elderly ex-offenders. But McLoughlin suddenly grabbed him and demanded to know where he kept his "gold and silver". He tied Mr Cory-Wright to the bed, stuffed silver family heirlooms into a pillowcase and demanded his bank cards and Pin numbers. Father-of-three Mr Buck, who lived two doors away from Mr Cory-Wright, went to help him after hearing shouting in his front garden. McLoughlin told police he was "sorry" for what he did to Mr Buck. He said he was confronted by Mr Buck as he tried to flee Mr Cory-Wright's house, and stabbed him in the neck. Witnesses described seeing Mr Buck with his throat slashed "wide open", prosecutor Ann Evans said. The court heard that Mr Buck's wife, Karen, said her life had been "turned upside down" by her husband's death. Shortly before his murder he had returned from a long weekend in Poland, where he met his baby granddaughter for the first time. Mr Buck was born in London and lived in Surrey and Sussex before moving to Hertfordshire in 1995. Since his retirement he had worked as a non-executive director at Aldwyck Housing Association in Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire. Mr Buck, who was described by his family as a "truly genuine person" had two sons, a daughter and two grandchildren. In July, Det Ch Supt Jeff Hill said: "Mr Buck's actions were totally selfless and illustrate a deep sense of community spirit which deserves recognition and respect." McLoughlin was jailed for 10 years in October 1983 for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, who lived in Stoke Newington. This sentence was reduced to eight years on appeal. McLoughlin was convicted of the murder of barman Peter Halls, 56, in Brighton in July 1992, who had offered him work. McLoughlin stabbed him in the neck. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years. McLoughlin said he assumed Mr Halls was gay, and thought that he may be expected to sleep with him. Ms Evans said: "The defendant claimed that Mr Halls confessed to liking young boys and... that he took holidays in Morocco for under-age sex." McLoughlin stabbed Mr Halls several times, and in 1992 was jailed for 25 years for murder, serving a total of 21 years behind bars, when he was allowed out on day release. </body>

      <title>School gates smokers abuse principal</title>
      <description>A head teacher in south London is targeted for abuse after asking parents to stop smoking outside the school gates.</description>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. "I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <body>A Lancashire woman who suffered brain damage in a quad bike accident in Australia has been awarded about £175,000 in compensation. Holly Raper, of Chorley, was working on a farm on King Island, Tasmania, when she came off the bike in December 2011. Doctors say she will need round-the-clock care for the rest of her life. Farmers David and Jocelyn Bowden were told to pay Ms Raper's mother the sum, the maximum amount allowable under Tasmanian legislation. At a Tasmanian Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Tribunal, Chief Commissioner Stephen Carey said Ms Raper, who was 21 at the time of the accident, had sustained "catastrophic neurological injury". She is being looked after by her mother and professional carers at her home. It is believed Ms Raper, a keen photographer, was herding cows on the vehicle when she fell off. She remained in a coma for a number of months before being flown home. Her return to the UK was delayed as the insurance company said her policy did not cover work injuries. The Tasmanian government eventually paid for her return. The lump sum of about 290,000 Australian dollars was the maximum amount allowable and was ordered to be paid within seven days. </body>

      <title>Girl find gives Needham mother hope</title>

      <body>The mother of a British child who went missing in Greece in 1991 has said the case of a girl allegedly abducted by a Roma couple has given her "fresh hope". A blonde girl called Maria, aged five or six, was found at a Greek Roma camp last week, and a couple who claimed to be her parents were arrested. Kerry Needham, whose son Ben was abducted in Kos aged 21 months, said she always believed gypsies took Ben. She said Greek police must now "investigate the gypsy theory further". Ms Needham said Maria's case had given her family "fresh hope and maximum publicity", and she remained certain Ben would be found. She told the BBC Greek authorities had suggested it would be "impossible" to conceal a blonde-haired child in a gypsy encampment, but the case of Maria - who has blonde hair - proved that wrong. She said the family had repeatedly claimed Ben had been taken by gypsies, but Greek police had always "strongly denied" the possibility. Ben, from Sheffield, went missing while on a family holiday in Kos. Ms Needham said she was in contact with South Yorkshire Police, but the force said there appeared to be "no direct correlation" between the cases of her son and Maria. A spokesman added: "No investigation is currently being carried out by the force in light of this recent case and officers from South Yorkshire Police will only become involved should authorities in Greece require our assistance." The girl named Maria was found in central Greece when police, who were carrying out a raid looking for drugs and weapons, noticed the lack of resemblance between the child and the couple claiming to be her parents. Officers checked documents, and DNA tests later revealed Maria was not related to the couple. A fake birth certificate suggested she was four years old, but the charity now caring for her says medical examinations have revealed she is probably five or six. A lawyer for the Roma couple has said Maria was given to them, not kidnapped. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, parents of Madeleine McCann, said the case of Maria had given them hope, according to the Daily Mirror. Madeleine was three years old when she was abducted in Portugal in 2007, and police investigating her disappearance have received more than 2,400 calls since an appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme was broadcast last week. </body>

      <body>A second man has been charged by police investigating the exploitation of migrant workers following a series of raids in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. Juris Valujevs, 35, of Turbus Road, King's Lynn, Norfolk, is accused of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster. He is also charged with fraud by false representation, conspiring to commit immigration offences and blackmail. Mr Valujevs appeared at Norwich Magistrates' Court on Saturday and was remanded in custody until October 24. On Thursday, Ivars Mezals, 27, of Conference Way, Wisbech, appeared before magistrates accused of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster, blackmail and fraud by false representation. He was remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 25 October. Eight other people detained after Tuesday's raids have been bailed. Two 44-year-old men from March, two men aged 26, both from Wisbech, and a 36-year-old woman, also from Wisbech, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, were given conditional bail last Wednesday. A 22-year-old woman from Wisbech, arrested on suspicion of possessing pepper spray, was bailed until 9 December. A 44-year-old man from March and a 27-year-old woman from Wisbech have been bailed until 7 November. Three recruitment agencies have also had their licences suspended by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). The raids were part of Operation Endeavour, which is looking into the working and living conditions of migrant agricultural workers - mainly from Lithuania and Latvia - in the Wisbech area of Cambridgeshire. </body>

      <body>Converted shipping containers are being delivered to a site in Brighton to be used as housing for homeless people. The first six containers are arriving at the car park on a former scrap metal yard in New England Road, with a further 30 due by the end of the week. Brighton Housing Trust (BHT) said the converted containers would provide temporary homes for five years for 36 men and women. The units were designed and built in Holland for a social housing project. The Amsterdam scheme failed to materialise because of funding difficulties. BHT chief executive Andy Winter said it meant the units were available at a discounted rate, adding to the financial viability of the Brighton homes. The 36 studios, in three and five storey blocks, will have balconies and external stairs to the upper levels. Brighton and Hove City Council's planning committee was told in April the containers were an "imaginative and appropriate" way to meet a need for affordable accommodation. In a blog on the BHT website, Mr Winter said shipping containers had rarely been used as temporary living accommodation in the UK but there were a number of examples in continental Europe. When the New England Quarter site is eventually redeveloped, the units could be transferred to other locations, the charity said. Mr Winter said the first 21 residents had been found and were preparing to take up residence in about five weeks. "The residents will free up space in other services that will be able to take in men and women who are currently on the streets," he said. "There is an acute shortage of affordable accommodation in Brighton and Hove, particularly for those with a history of homelessness." He said the official number of street homeless people in the city was 43 in November 2012 but the actual figure was more likely to be between 70 and 100. </body>

      <body>A volunteer first aider sacked for speeding on his way to an emergency call in Oxford could be re-instated after undergoing training. Gof Smith, 64, said he was "thrilled" after hearing the news. More than 1,500 people in Faringdon signed a petition in support of Mr Smith after he was sacked for driving at 33mph in a 20mph zone. South Central Ambulance Service said it could not "prejudge the outcome" of the reassessment process. In a statement, it said Mr Smith was originally sacked for "having committed serious traffic offences". However, following an appeal, the service reviewed the dismissal and agreed to carry out a process of "retraining and re-assessment" with Mr Smith, in recognition of his "valued service". Mr Smith, who has spent 15 years as a community first responder (CFR), was dismissed after speeding while responding to an emergency call where a man had collapsed in the street in St Clements, Oxford, on 23 July. The man survived after being treated by Mr Smith. His car was recorded doing 33mph by the ambulance service's in-car logging system as he drove through a 20mph zone. Mr Smith says he did not realise the speed limit in the area. A CFR is a volunteer trained to attend emergency calls received by the ambulance service and provide care until an ambulance crew arrives. They are not permitted to exceed the speed limit, even if attending an emergency call. </body>

      <body>Police are investigating new allegations that online racist abuse was directed at Norwich City manager Chris Hughton. A Norfolk Police spokesman said the force received complaints on Saturday about a comment posted on an unofficial fans' page on Facebook. It follows complaints earlier this month about the alleged racist abuse of the football manager on Facebook. A Norwich City spokesman said the club had been made aware of the matter. A police spokesman said: "Norfolk Constabulary takes every incident of hate crime very seriously. "No incident is seen as trivial and every report is investigated thoroughly." He said the latest comment had been taken down from the site, and added that the earlier allegation was still being investigated. The Norwich City spokesman said: "We will fully support the relevant authorities in their inquiries into the matter," he said. "We deeply regret any incidents such as this and take them very seriously indeed." He said anybody convicted over the alleged abuse would face a lifetime ban from Carrow Road in addition to any criminal punishment. </body>

      <body>A £65m steam turbine power plant fuelled by local wood is to be built at the former Pfizer plant in Kent. Estover Energy said the combined heat and power (CHP) plant would supply renewable heat and energy across the 220-acre Discovery Park in Sandwich. The science and technology park, vacated by the drugs giant last year, is a designated Enterprise Zone. Dover District Council said planning permission for the biomass plant was granted on Friday. Estover's application was approved under powers delegated to council officers, which meant it did not have to go to the planning committee. The energy plant will use low-grade wood from forests and woodland within an average of 80 miles from Sandwich to create enough energy to supply the equivalent of 21,000 homes. Power will be supplied to businesses at Discovery Park as well as the national grid. Estover said building work was expected to begin next spring. About 100 jobs will be created during construction with 20 permanent positions at the plant and 20 in the forestry and transport sector. Energy minister Greg Barker, MP for Bexhill and Battle, said the CHP plant would help stimulate the rural economy. "By sourcing their fuel from the South East the wider benefits of developing a new supply chain are felt locally and provide a much-needed market to support coppice woodlands in south-east England," he said. Discovery Park chairman Trevor Cartner said: "The benefits to us and to the wider region are significant and we are proud that we can now offer our tenants a clean and sustainable source of energy for the future." </body>

      <body>Two men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with terror offences following a police operation. The men, both aged 25, were arrested in London on 13 October. They cannot be named for legal reasons. One man, known as "AB", was charged under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which relates to preparation for acts of terrorism. Both have been charged under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 - relating to possession of terrorist information. The charge relates specifically to a computer file labelled "bomb making". The second man, known as "CD" , has also been charged with a further offence contrary to Section 4 of the Identity Documents Act 2010. Judge Michael Snow referred the case to the Old Bailey on 18 November and ordered that both men be remanded in custody. The two men were arrested in a car in Mansell Street, Whitechapel, east London, after police fired "Hatton rounds" - ammunition designed to burst tyres and blow open doors. Two other men arrested during the same operation were released on Saturday. </body>

      <body>A teenage Chelsea fan has told of the "crazy" moment he ended up sitting next to a banished Jose Mourinho during a match against Cardiff. Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting. The Portuguese manager went up into the stands and sat down next to Sean Buxton, from Chelmsford in Essex. The 17-year-old said: "It was so intimidating, something I've never ever experienced before, it was crazy." Sean, a sport student at Writtle College, said he was a big fan of Mourinho but did not know what to say to his side's manager when he spent 20 minutes sat next to him. "I moved up as he walked over and he sat next to me. "I took a picture of me and him. He didn't know I had taken the photo. He seemed a bit frustrated at the time. "But when we went 3-1 up he was happy." Sean, who paid £15.50 for his seat for the game, said he was delighted at the experience. After the match on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland said: "Jose was furious on the touchlines." </body>

      <body>A ukulele-strumming policeman is using the music of George Formby in the fight against crime. Sgt Giles Dean has reworked the classic Formby tune When I'm Cleaning Windows to become When I'm Burgling Houses. The self-taught strummer, who is based in Smethwick in the West Midlands, said it was "incredible" how many people still fail to heed basic advice. The plucky policeman said if his Formby YouTube tribute helped foil just one burglary it would have been worth it. Perhaps the lyrical highlight of his bold re-imagining of the legendary performer's most famous song comes in the opening salvo. In the the first burst of his version, the 44-year-old crime fighter croons: "Now I go burglin' houses to earn a dishonest bob, with all the help you give me it's a very easy job." In the 1936 classic - formally titled The Window Cleaner - Formby himself sings: "Now I go window cleaning to earn an honest bob, for a nosey parker it's an interesting job." Sgt Dean, who has been plucking at his banjo-ukulele for about five years, said too many people were still leaving their cars unlocked with valuables on display or windows open in their houses. The policeman, who has served with the West Midlands force for 22 years and oversees neighbourhood policing in Smethwick, said: "I've been playing the ukulele for a few years now so thought putting these messages out in the form of lyrics in a fun song would strike a chord with residents and motorists. "We've seen a significant drop in burglaries and car crime across Sandwell, and if this song jogs the mind of just one person to brush up their security, and prevents an offence, it will have been worth it." </body>

      <description>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United can still win the Premier League despite their poor start.</description>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United are still involved in the Premier League title race. The Gunners are top of the table, eight points clear of the reigning champions, who have endured their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the standings. "Are Man United out of the title race? No, but of course 10 points starts to be a little gap," said Wenger. "They have big players, big experience and they are a big club." A late goal from Southampton's Adam Lallana denied United victory at Old Trafford on Saturday, with the south-coast club sitting sixth and holding a four-point advantage over David Moyes's side. In contrast, Arsenal's resounding 4-1 win over Norwich at the Emirates maintained their two-point advantage at the top of the league and extended their unbeaten run since their opening day defeat to Aston Villa. "If you have the choice, you want to be in the race at the top, but you cannot rule Man United out today," added Wenger. "It is too early." The Frenchman, whose side overturned United's 12-point lead to win the title in 1998, added that eight points can be retrieved quickly. "It is three games," said Wenger. "That is very quick in our league." Scrutiny of United's form has been intense since Moyes became manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since a 4-1 opening day win at Swansea, his side have only beaten the league's bottom two sides and have suffered defeats by Liverpool, Manchester City and West Brom. The run leaves them seven points worse off than at the same stage last season, when they eventually won the title by 11 points. BBC pundit Alan Hansen says the poor run of form is in danger of ending their hopes this term. "In terms of the title, they are certainly on the verge of losing it as a consequence of their unconvincing start to the season," Hansen wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.  "United were truly awful at times in the early weeks and months of last season, but the difference between then and now was that they dragged themselves to victories with the late surges that are missing now. "Maybe that is down to the 'Fergie factor', but it is more likely down to the inevitability that, sooner or later, the tide begins to turn." Former Everton manager Moyes has already admitted filling the void left by Ferguson after his 27 years and 38 trophies at Old Trafford will be difficult. Ex-United striker Dion Dublin, speaking to MOTD2 Extra, believes Ferguson is missed. "As a player who played at Old Trafford for Coventry and Villa, you sometimes lose the game before you get off the coach because you're in such awe of the stadium and players you are going to play against - and managers can be the same," said Dublin. "Ferguson's not there anymore, so players are thinking 'hold on, we've got a chance here'." </body>

      <body>Forest Green manager Dave Hockaday has left the club by mutual consent. The Conference Premier side started the season by thrashing Hyde 8-0 but have lost seven of their last eight games. Former Swindon and Blackpool player Hockaday, 55, took over at the New Lawn in 2009, having previously worked as a coach at Watford. He led Rovers to a 10th-place finish last season and, as one of the biggest spenders in the league, they were tipped for promotion this term. But having lost their last four games, they are 18th in the table, four points from the drop-zone. In a statement, Hockaday said: "Football is a results driven business and recently results haven't been good enough. "I feel I have left the club, both on and off the field, in the best shape it has ever been. I am proud of what I've achieved here and feel the time is right to move on. "I wish everyone at the club the very best - Forest Green Rovers will always have a place in my heart." Forest Green, the longest-serving club in the division, finished in the relegation zone in Hockaday's second year in charge but kept their place in the Conference after Salisbury's double demotion. Rovers were in financial difficulty at the time but were rescued by a takeover by now chairman Dale Vince, a green energy tycoon. The club became famous for their ecological awareness, which included a ban on all red meat and the introduction of an organic pitch, and Vince invested heavily in the playing budget as they looked to reach the Football League for the first time in their history. They were in promotion contention at the end of last season but a run of five defeats saw them fall away from the pack. </body>

      <body>The young telegraphist who picked up the Titanic's distress call, has been honoured with a plaque in the Nottinghamshire village where he lived. Harold Cottam, 21, a wireless operator aboard the passenger liner RMS Carpathia, was off duty when he picked up the call on 15 April 1912. The blue plaque was unveiled by Cottam's granddaughter Wendy Gell at the Ship Inn in Lowdham on Saturday. BBC East Midlands Today's Carol Hinds spoke to maritime historian Graham Anthony and Mr Cottam's relatives Nichola Gell, Carol Wauchope and Wendy Gell. </body>

      <body>A witness who claims to have seen the car thought to have been involved in the murders of three members of a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps last September, has spoken publicly for the first time. A forestry worker has told the BBC's Panorama programme he saw a British dark grey BMW shortly before the attack. We drive through the sleepy village of Chevaline up a narrow road leading high into the Alps. Rounding the corner we pull over at a parking spot called Le Martinet, hidden beneath the tree canopy. The mountains are shrouded in mist and amidst the rush of the stream and chatter of birds, it is hard to imagine the horror of what happened in this idyllic spot. Three members of the al-Hilli family - a father, mother and grandmother - were murdered at point blank range here. A seven-year-old child was left for dead and her four-year-old sister was so traumatised she was only discovered hiding underneath her dead mother's skirt in the back of the car eight hours after the emergency services arrived. Only Zaid al-Hilli, the brother of the driver of the car, has ever been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. He denies arranging the murders and is on bail. He has not been charged. I have come back to the scene with a British cyclist who discovered the crime to find out exactly what happened. Brett Martin, a former RAF pilot who has a holiday home in the area, set off for a cycle ride in the early afternoon of 5 September 2012. "I left the house at about 14:30 [with] no fixed route in my mind," he said. "It was sunny… [and] quite a peaceful, pleasant afternoon." He took the same narrow road up the mountain. Ahead of him was a French cyclist. On his way up he was overtaken by a vehicle which he believes was the al-Hilli's car. According to French police, the Al Hillis reached Le Martinet at about 15:40, having passed the French cyclist. Saad al-Hilli got out of the car with his seven year old daughter, Zainab. In less than a minute, Saad and his wife Iqbal, from Surrey, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, and the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, had been fatally shot. Zainab had been wounded but the gunman ran out of bullets and clubbed her with his gun. She survived but all she has been able to tell investigators about the killer is that she saw 'one bad man'. Coming up the hill at about 15:45, Brett Martin saw the motorcyclist escaping. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he said. When he arrived at the scene, Mr Martin initially thought he had come across a traffic accident. Realising there had been a shooting, he feared for his own life. "I was thinking is there a hunter, a sniper kind of character, hiding in the trees, maybe shooting from a covered position? "I was thinking to myself, I wonder if this is going to be painful when I get shot?" Mr Martin tried to call the emergency services but could not get a signal. After checking on the little girl he went for help. No culprit has been found and French police admit they have no evidence as to who the hitman and his accomplices were. But Panorama has tracked down a witness who suggests the killer was not acting alone. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting has never spoken publicly before. He drove me along the same route but does not want to be identified for fear of the killer still at large. "When I arrived there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here," he said. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." He also saw a British car driven by someone who seems to have been an accomplice. "He arrived on the left and he passed really quickly. The car was a BMW 4x4, X5, grey metallic, in good condition. "It was a right hand drive, English. I didn't get much of a look at him but the driver was slightly bald and he had dark skin, no glasses." Ten minutes later, two of his colleagues driving down the same road saw the motorbike up the hill from the parking area beyond where motor vehicles were not allowed to go. "They told me they passed the motorbike I had passed at Place Martinet - two bends further up. "They had words with him because motor vehicles aren't allowed. So they called out to him and asked him to drive down. They saw his face because he lifted his helmet...he had a bit of a beard." This seems to suggest that at least two people acted together - one carrying out surveillance, the other the hitman. The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said there is no evidence as to who the hitman or his accomplices were. In less than a minute, 21 bullets were fired with great accuracy, leading investigators to wonder whether the attack was a contract killing carried out by someone in the criminal underworld. French police have traced all the vehicles in the area that day except two - the motorbike and the grey four-by-four. They are still searching for them. The terrible events he witnessed have not stopped Brett Martin from riding his bike up the same road when he visits his holiday home. But the events of that day will always be with him. "It's a mystery. Perplexing, unsolved, [it's] one of those Agatha Christie 'whodunit' scenarios."

      <description>The peril facing Britain's woodlands from foreign pests</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>Rock legend David Bowie has been left empty-handed at this year's Q Awards, despite receiving six nominations. He was trounced by Ellie Goulding in the prize for best solo artist, while Vampire Weekend beat him to the award for "best act in the world today". The 66-year-old's comeback record, The Next Day - given five stars by Q Magazine in April - lost out to Biffy Clyro in the best album category. The awards are chosen by readers of the monthly music magazine and its website. Biffy Clyro's Simon Neill said: "Thank you so so much. I think I speak on every award winner's behalf when I say thank goodness David Bowie didn't turn up." Glastonbury won best event of 2013, beating Bowie's exhibition at the VandA Museum, and Kraftwerk's series of 3D live shows at Tate Modern. Best single went to Arctic Monkeys, for Do I Wanna Know?; while The Manic Street Preachers took home best video, for Show Me The Wonder. Comic Al Murray quipped as the Manics left the stage: "The Manic Street Preachers. Apart from Doctor Who, the only industry left in Wales." Starring Submarine actor Craig Roberts, the miniature love story was filmed in the Pioneer Working Men's Club in Porth, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales. Teenage singer-songwriter Jake Bugg was named best new act, while cerebral Oxford rockers Foals won the best live band trophy. Yannis Philippakis, lead singer from the band, said: "It shows you don't need a backing track, you don't need affectation, you don't need Elvis Presley impersonations." Bowie, who did not attend the award ceremony, was expected to win several prizes following his surprise comeback in January after a 10-year hiatus. Q Magazine had showered his album with praise, calling it "a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that... sound like they desperately need to be sung". However, he was not the only artist to walk away empty-handed. Daft Punk, the French dance duo whose inescapable single Get Lucky has contributed to the best year for British single sales in history, also failed to win any of the three categories in which they were nominated. The annual ceremony also distributes a number of lifetime achievement awards, decided by "Q's resident musical experts". This year's recipients included Chrissie Hynde (classic songwriter), Robbie Williams (Q Idol) and reinvigorated rock band Suede (Q Icon). Williams joked as he collected his award: "Sorry I couldn't be here in person to receive this. Of all the made-up awards to get a celebrity to an awards show, this is definitely one of them." The Pet Shop Boys were also given the Outstanding Contribution to Music award. "We keep being told that these are tough times for the industry, but the evidence here suggests the opposite," said Q's senior editor Matt Mason. "We're particularly delighted to salute evergreen artists such as Robbie, the Pet Shop Boys and Suede, who've all made excellent new music over the last 12 months. "They're brilliant reminders of the enduring power of the great British pop act." </body>

      <body>A piece by Conrad Shawcross has won a competition to replace a stolen Barbara Hepworth sculpture in a London park. Shawcross's Three Perpetual Chords will replace Hepworth's bronze Two Forms (Divided Circle), which was stolen two years ago from Dulwich Park. "It is an honour to have been selected, given the legacy of Barbara Hepworth," Shawcross said. The artist beat other accomplished artists including Turner Prize nominee Anya Gallaccio and Eva Rothschild. Hepworth's sculpture, which was insured for £500,000, was stolen by suspected scrap metal thieves from the park in south London. It was cut from its plinth in December 2011 and has never been recovered. The price it could fetch as scrap metal would only be a tiny fraction of its value as a complete work. Shawcross's piece will be made of cast iron and filled with concrete, to make it harder to steal. The competition, organised by the Contemporary Art Society on behalf of Southwark Council, initially stipulated that submitted works could not be made out of metal to prevent thieves targeting it but the rules were changed when Shawcross entered his proposed sculpture. Fabienne Nicholas, head of art consultancy at the Contemporary Art Society, said: "Conrad's series of sculptural works will create a new journey through the park - offering a thoughtfully sequenced experience for park visitors. These are sculptures that give not only aesthetic pleasure but something playful too - they, like the Hepworth, invite a human scale interaction." Dame Barbara Hepworth, who died in 1975 in a fire at her studio in St Ives, Cornwall, is considered to be one of the UK's most important modern sculptors, with her work displayed in museums and public spaces around the world. Shawcross found fame when his wooden sculpture, The Nervous System, was bought by Charles Saatchi ten years ago. He recently showcased a timepiece installation in Camden's Roundhouse venue in north London. </body>

      <body>Sandra Bullock's space thriller Gravity has held on to the top of the US and Canadian box office for a third week. The 3D thriller, co-starring George Clooney, took $31 million (£19m) according to figures from Rentrak. Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, stayed in second place, taking $17.3 million (£10.6m) in its second week. WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, had 2013's worst debut weekend so far, taking just $1.7m. (£1m) Assange, who founded whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, had claimed Disney's film would be a failure. Last week, an email he wrote to Cumberbatch urging him not to take part in the project was released online. Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuaron and starring Bullock and Clooney as astronauts stranded in space, has now made more than $170m (£105m) in three weeks. IMAX screenings have proved particularly popular because of the film's groundbreaking visuals, accounting for $38m (£23m) in ticket sales, with 82% of audiences opting for 3D showings. Warner Brothers' Jeffrey Goldstein has attributed the film's success to "phenomenal word of mouth". Paul Greengrass's true story-based Somali pirate drama Captain Philips also held off newcomer Carrie. The horror remake, starring Kick-Ass actress Chloe Grace Moretz, took third place, with $17m (£10m). The original 1976 film, based on Stephen King's novel, saw Oscar nominations for actresses Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Family favourite, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, was in fourth after taking $10.1m (£6.2m) in its fourth week. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's new action film Escape Plan rounded off the top five with $9.8m (£6m). In a limited release of just 19 cinemas, Steve McQueen's Oscar-tipped slavery epic 12 Years a Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, opened with a promising $960,000 (£594,000). </body>

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

      <title>Poppins film gets world premiere</title>
      <description>Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson attend the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a film about the long and difficult process of making the classic Disney musical Mary Poppins.</description>

      <body>Emma Thompson has admitted she loved the "belligerence" of her character in Saving Mr Banks, a film about the long and difficult process of making the Disney musical Mary Poppins. The film, which stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, had its world premiere in London on Sunday night. It officially brought this year's BFI London Film Festival to a close. Both Thompson and Hanks walked the red carpet in Leicester Square to the delight of hundreds of fans who had braved heavy rain earlier in the day. The film focuses on the real-life battle of wills between prickly author PL Travers, played by Thompson, and Walt Disney over the movie rights to her famous literary creation. Directed by John Lee Hancock, the film is already being tipped for Oscar success. It is not released in the UK until 29 November. Hanks, who walked the damp and chilly red carpet holding a mug of tea, told the BBC it had been "an honour" that two of his films had opened and closed the 10-day film festival. The festival kicked off with maritime thriller Captain Phillips, a true story in which Hanks plays a ship's captain taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009. Speaking about his role as Walt Disney, Tom Hanks said: "In a lot of ways Mary Poppins was the crowning achievement of everything he did, it won all the Academy Awards, it was a huge monster hit and it was the last movie that he truly was hands-on." Speaking to the BBC, Thompson said she had found the role of PL Travers "really difficult". The Australian-born British author was interesting, she said, because she was "full of contradictions". In reality, Walt Disney had spent some 20 years in pursuit of the film rights to Mary Poppins. The main focus of the film is the two weeks in 1961 that Travers reluctantly spent with Disney in Los Angeles as he tried to win her over. During the visit she was played songs by the Sherman brothers, which ended up in the 1964 film, such as A Spoonful of Sugar and Let's Go Fly a Kite. "What was fun was inhabiting someone who refused to let the fairy dust work," said Thompson. "I loved her belligerence, I loved playing her rudeness, and her honesty." She said she had wanted to work with Tom Hanks for years "then suddenly along came this very grown up drama about two artists who are both very complicated people, who expressed their traumas in very different ways, because they both had extremely difficult childhoods". Travers, who died in 1996, so disliked the Oscar-winning Disney production that she never allowed any more Mary Poppins books to be adapted into films. The cast of Saving Mr Banks also includes Irish actor Colin Farrell and English actress Ruth Wilson, who play the parents of the young PL Travers in 1906 Australia. Asked about seeing the film premiere in London, screenwriter Kelly Marcel said: "It means everything to me. It's a home grown project that was written here in England so to close the London Film Festival feels like we are bring it home." BFI London Film Festival director Clare Stewart said there had been a "great audience response" to this year's festival. She said that the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks was a magical way to bring the event to a close. She added: "There is a moment in the film when Walt Disney says to PL Travers that audiences around the world 'from Leicester Square to Kansas City' will be moved by Mary Poppins, and so I had to have that film in Leicester Square." At the festival's awards ceremony on Saturday night, Sir Christopher Lee was presented with his fellowship from the British Film Institute by his friend Johnny Depp. The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. The festival included gala screenings of Stephen Frears' Philomena, the true story of a woman's search for her lost son starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch. Other films included Alfonso Cuaron's space-odyssey thriller Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes' The Invisible Woman, a period romance centring on the affair between Charles Dickens and actress Nelly Ternan, and the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene. </body>

      <body>US comedian Carol Burnett has been honoured with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Dame Julie Andrews, Tony Bennett and Tina Fey were among those who performed in her honour at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Sunday. Burnett's variety show began in the 1960s and ran for 11 years, averaging 30 million viewers a week. "This is very encouraging... it was a long time in coming," Burnett joked as she accepted the prize. She added: "I understand because there are so many people funnier than I am, especially here in Washington. "With any luck, they'll soon get voted out, and I'll still have the Mark Twain Prize." Fey - creator and star of 30 Rock - applauded Burnett, 80, for opening doors for other female comedians. When Burnett first launched her own show, a TV executive told her the genre was "a man's game". "You mean so much to me," Fey said. "I love you in a way that is just shy of creepy," she joked. Burnett got her first break when she was talent-spotted by bookers for the Ed Sullivan Show. She then landed a role on Broadway and began to appear on The Garry Moore Show. This led to Burnett signing a 10-year contract with CBS to do guest slots on sitcoms and perform in one TV special a year. She launched the Carol Burnett Show in 1967, with guest stars including Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan. It won 22 Emmy awards. Burnett was best known for her "Tarzan" yell and for ending each show by tugging her ear, which was a personal message to her grandmother. Tim Conway, one of Burnett's co-stars on her show, joked that he now spends his time travelling around the US for Burnett to receive awards. "Thank you for being such a friend, such a generous person, not with salary, but generous." </body>

      <title>Polish film Ida wins double awards</title>
      <description>Holocaust drama Ida wins best film at the Warsaw Film Festival but Polish director Paweł Pawlikowski misses the ceremony to accept the same prize in London.</description>

      <body>Polish director Paweł Pawlikowski won best film at the Warsaw Film Festival on Saturday - but missed the event to accept the same prize in London. His film, Ida, tells the story of a novice nun who must confront a family secret, dating from the Nazi occupation, before taking her vows. The Warsaw jury called it "a beautiful and delicate film" about post-war Poland "trying to get past its demons". Actress Agata Kulesza accepted the Grand Prix on Pawlikowski's behalf. The jury's decision was based on "the superb combination of script, directing, cinematography, acting and music," they added in a statement. Now based in Paris, Pawlikowski first made his name as a feature filmmaker in the UK. He received a Bafta for best newcomer with Last Resort in 2000, and went on to win best film at the Edinburgh Film Festival with My Summer of Love in 2004. Ida is his first film to be made in his native country. The director has admitted that people had doubts about the black-and-white film, which was shot with a static camera and features actors unknown outside Poland. Some said it could have been "a little bit of professional hara-kiri," he said. "But it doesn't seem to be the case, so I'm really relieved." At the BFI London Film Festival, Ida beat competition from the likes of Parkland, about the assassination of John F Kennedy, and Under The Skin, which stars Scarlett Johansson as "a voracious alien in human form". Philip French, president of London's official competition jury, described Ida as a "courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation - the German occupation and the Holocaust - which continues to resonate". </body>

      <body>US rockers OneRepublic have topped the singles chart again with Counting Stars, a week after being knocked from the top by Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball. They were number one two weeks ago, in a run of success for frontman Ryan Tedder, who wrote James Blunt's single Bonfire Heart, up two to number four. Tedder has also written hits for singers including Adele, Beyonce, Ellie Goulding and Leona Lewis. "This is by far the coolest thing that's happened to us," he said. "I've had a number of number ones with other artists, but never one with this band. This is the highlight of the year." Lawson were straight in at number three with Juliet, followed by Blunt, while Eminem's Rap God debuted at number five. His eighth album, The Marshall Mathers LP2, is released next month. UK pop group Lawson have now achieved five top 10 hits since forming in 2009. In the album chart, John Newman's debut album Tribute beat big comebacks from Pearl Jam, Sir Paul McCartney and Cher. Newman, 23, from Settle in North Yorkshire, found fame with his guest vocals on Rudimental's number one Feel The Love last summer. Grunge group Pearl Jam made it to number two with Lightening Bolt - their highest chart placing in the UK since VS in 1993, which also made it to the same spot. Sir Paul, 71, was at three with his 16th solo album, New, while Cher, 67, was at four with Closer to the Truth, her highest-charting studio album since Love Hurts topped the charts 22 years ago. Britain's Got Talent finalists Jonathan And Charlotte were at number five with their second album Perhaps Love. Synthpop pioneer Gary Numan debuted at number 20 with his 20th studio album, Splinter. </body>

      <body>Free tickets for a Van Morrison concert, staged to celebrate the singer being granted the freedom of his native Belfast, will be drawn from a lottery. The 68 year old is due to be conferred with the honour on 15 November, and later that evening he will perform a free gig at Belfast's Waterfront Hall. A total of 2,000 tickets will be made available. Members of the public can apply online or in person at the Waterfront from 10:00 BST on Tuesday 22 October. Applications can be made on both the Belfast City Council and Waterfront Hall websites, and applications will be open until 17:00 BST on Wednesday, 30 October. A computerised draw will ensure a spread of people from different parts of the city will be successful, said Belfast City Council. Winners will receive two tickets each. A council spokesperson said: "The one-off concert at the Waterfront Hall is being held to mark Belfast City Council conferring the Freedom of the City on the legendary musician to mark his remarkable global status and contribution to the city where he was born." Councillors unanimously agreed to grant the accolade following a vote last month. The following day, Morrison released a statement of thanks, saying he was "delighted and honoured" to receive the freedom of his native city. He said: "Belfast is my home. It is where I first heard the music that influenced and inspired me, it is where I first performed and it is somewhere I have referred back to many times in my song-writing over the past fifty years." Morrison, known affectionately to fans as "Van the Man", was brought up in the east of the city. He references several of the city's streets and landmarks in his lyrics, including Cypress Avenue, Sandy Row and his family home in Hyndford Street. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <body>As parliamentary polls get under way in the Czech Republic this week, artist David Cerny has floated a huge purple statue of an extended middle finger down the River Vltava in Prague. The outsized purple hand has been mounted on a barge floating on the river. It is pointed at Prague Castle, the seat of President Milos Zeman. Mr Cerny has shocked and mocked politicians and public figures in the past, says the BBC's Rob Cameron. This latest piece is clearly his message to the leftist President Zeman and the political party recently set up by his supporters, our correspondent says. It is unclear how long the finger will stay there; Cerny himself declined to say too much about the piece, telling reporters the gesture spoke for itself - what mattered, he said, was which way it was pointing. President Zeman, meanwhile, is on an official visit to Ukraine and said he could not comment until he had seen it. The Czech parliament was dissolved in August following weeks of turmoil in Czech politics. Prime Minister Petr Necas's government collapsed in June amid a bribery scandal, and a government of technocrats, formed by President Zeman in July and opposed by the main political parties, resigned in August. </body>

      <body>A life-size bronze statue of comedy character Frank Sidebottom has been unveiled in his hometown of Timperley in Greater Manchester. The character with a huge papier mache head was the alter-ego of musician and comedian Chris Sievey, who died in 2010. Fans raised £60,000 for the tribute which was made in a Czech foundry. Hundreds of people attended an unveiling ceremony earlier, many in fancy dress for the occasion. Neil Taylor, who helped raise the donations for the statue, said its installation would mean that "Frank will gaze on the Timperley sunset forever". He said: "You either got the humour or you didn't get the humour. "Frank Sidebottom created a whole world, he was just magical. He just made a very modest living entertaining people and that's what he's enjoying doing." Sievey set his character's life in the village, where he lived himself, and, as Frank, hosted tours of the area for fans. He often referenced Timperley in his TV and music work, notably on his 1987 release, The Timperley EP, which featured a version of The Kinks' 1967 song Waterloo Sunset with altered lyrics that referred extensively to the village. He also covered Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, changing its title to Anarchy in Timperley. Although best known for Frank Sidebottom, Sievey also had success in the late 1970s with his punk band The Freshies, who had a hit with I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk. His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show. Next year Michael Fassbender will play Frank Sidebottom in Frank, a movie inspired by the character. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>Row over Tony Blair 'selfie' artwork</title>
      <description>Two artists complain after advertising companies refuse to allow their photo montage of Tony Blair in front of a burning Iraq oilfield on billboards.</description>

      <body>Two artists who created a montage of Tony Blair apparently taking his own photo in front of a burning oilfield in Iraq have accused advertising firms of banning the artwork from billboards. Peter Kennard and Cat Phillips created the image, titled Photo Op, in 2005. It was chosen by the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester as the image for a poster campaign to promote a new exhibition about modern art and war. But two of the UK's biggest advertising companies refused to carry the image. Photo Op combines a picture of the grinning former prime minister taking a self-portrait on a mobile phone, originally from the 2005 general election campaign, with a separate image of a blazing oilfield during the Iraq war. It has previously been exhibited at Tate Britain and was recently described by The Guardian as "the definitive work of art about the Iraq war". It is now in the Imperial War Museum North's Catalyst exhibition and the museum had intended to use it on posters and billboards. But the artists, who go by the name kennardphillips, have accused advertising companies JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor of "political censorship" in refusing to carry it. The two firms controlled between 50%-70% of the outdoor advertising market in 2011, according to a government report. CBS Outdoor said the poster was refused after consultation with the Committee of Advertising Practice, which advises firms on whether ads may breach its code of conduct. Neither gave details of which part of the code it breached, but the code includes rules forbidding ads that are misleading and are likely to cause "serious or widespread offence". Kennard and Phillips said CBS Outdoor had told them they could not use images involving explosions on public transport, such as on the sides of buses. JCDecaux declined to comment. "It feels like you're not allowed to show anything that appears dissenting," Phillips said. "You get a lot of violence and sex in adverts and a lot of offensive things, but they're not critical in their offence. They're not creating an argument or a question mark. "It feels like if you have anything that is a real show of dissent, it wouldn't be allowed to go up there and there's very little you can do about it." The Catalyst exhibition opened at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) North in Manchester on Saturday. It is the museum's first major exhibition of war-inspired contemporary art inspired created since 1991. The museum's director Graham Boxer said "a number of outdoor advertising suppliers" refused to run the proposed poster campaign. He added: "IWM North aims to inspire discussion and debate about war and conflict and as such we have remained committed to using the kennardphillipps Photo Op image across other media, including on the website, in media coverage, on social media and of course in the exhibition." A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which operates the Committee of Advertising Practice, said the ad companies "would have been mindful of the advertising rules that require ads are prepared responsibly and do not contain anything that is likely to be misleading, harmful or offensive". </body>

      <description>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti is taken to hospital after becoming disorientated during a recital in Florida.</description>

      <body>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti has been taken to hospital after falling ill during a recital in Florida. According to eyewitnesses, Kuerti became disorientated and started repeatedly playing the same passage. "One of the audience members who's also a pianist actually went up to the stage to put his arm around him," said concert organiser Alan Penchansky. "He tried to find out what was wrong, and [Kuerti] started again. He simply was trapped," he told Canadian press. The fellow-musician, Santiago Rodriguez, a professor of keyboard performance at the Frost School of Music, eventually coaxed Kuerti off stage, and an intermission was called. During the intermission, Kuerti was seen by paramedics and taken to hospital by ambulance. He did not return. The Austrian-born pianist has been performing live almost all of his life - having first taken to the stage with the Boston Pops Orchestra at the age of 11. As a soloist, he has specialised in Beethoven, frequently playing the composer's entire cycle of 32 sonatas, and all five of his concertos. In 1997, US classical music magazine Fanfare called him "the best pianist currently playing", and he was an made an Officer of the Order of Canada the following year. BBC Radio 3 also named him one of the 50 Great Pianists in 2012. Now 75, he was performing at the Coral Gables Congregational Church in Miami when he was taken ill. Audience member Dorothy Hindman said the pianist "spoke intelligently and humorously" before the recital, which focussed on Beethoven's lesser-known works. He started playing Rondo in G major, Op 51, No 29 with an "exceptionally clear tone", she added, and his repetition of the closing theme was initially interpreted "as a private musical joke". But "Kuerti's growing disorientation and numerous stops and starts during the second of the Eleven Bagatelles, Op 119, signalled clearly to the large audience that something was terribly wrong". Writing in the South Florida Classical Review, Hindman said the stricken musician received a standing ovation as he left the stage. There was no further information on his condition at the time of writing. </body>

      <title>Ejiofor defends slavery film scenes</title>
      <description>Chiwetel Ejiofor defends the harrowing scenes of violence in the film 12 Years a Slave, saying they were needed to be truthful to the story.</description>

      <body>Chiwetel Ejiofor has defended the harrowing scenes of violence in his new film 12 Years a Slave. The British actor plays a free black man from New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. "As an actor you have to slip down the rabbit hole and see what happens because there was no other way of telling the story," Ejiofor said. He was speaking before the film's European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The historical drama, from British director Steve McQueen, is already considered a leading contender for the Oscars. It contains several unflinching scenes in slaves are beaten and one where Ejiofor's character, Solomon Northup, is left hanging by a noose all day long, standing on tiptoes to stay alive. "I knew that [Steve] would go to all the places that you'd have to go to and that's what I wanted to tell the story," Ejiofor told a press conference in London on Friday. "It's a strange handicap if you can't talk about violence in a film about slavery. You are not going to do justice to any of the people involved. "I read into the script that there were obviously going to be these struggles and I wanted to embrace that." McQueen, whose films include Hunger and Shame, said that he had wanted to make a film about slavery and had been drawn to Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, 12 Years a Slave. "The book is pretty extreme," he said. "My responsibility is this: either I'm making a film about slavery or I'm not. "If you make a film about slavery you have to understand why people were in bondage in this way for 400 years, through mental and physical torture." The film has been receiving rave reviews ever since its first screening at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado at the end of August. It won the People's Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, which can be an indicator of Oscar success. The cast includes Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt. Earlier this week Fassbender was reported to have said he would not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role as violent cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps. "It's just a grind. And I'm not a politician. I'm an actor," the actor told GQ magazine. Asked about Fassbender's comments, McQueen said: "He's an amazing artist. He's a force to be reckoned with." "His campaign is on that screen," he added. "He's done his thing - that's it." 12 Years A Slave is out in the UK in January 2014. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science-fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($13,000; £8,000). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>The funeral of Pakistani singer, Zubeida Khanum, who died aged 78 following a heart attack at her home in Lahore, has taken place in the city. Khanum, who recorded almost 250 songs during her career, was famed for her performances during Lollywood's "golden era" of the 50s and 60s. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif described her as a "national asset". She acted in the film Billoo in 1951 but found fame in 1953 with playback singing, pre-recorded for use in films. She received great recognition from the Pakistani film industry for her playback work in the 1953 film Shehri Babu. During the early years of her career, she also did brief roles in a handful of films including Morni and Patey Khan alongside the late Noor Jehan. President Mamnoon Hussain recalled her services for performing arts in the country and said they were "unforgettable". Born in 1935 in Amritsar, Khanum migrated with her family to Pakistan after the partition. She was the eldest of four children and her talent for singing was spotted at school by her teacher, who put her in touch with Radio Pakistan. Despite her family being against a career in music, Khanum performed her first song in Punjabi. Speaking to the BBC in one of her last interviews, she said: "I always had a passion for singing. I was so happy being in the studio. "They loved my voice". One of her favourite songs was from the hit film Saat Lakh called Aaye Mausam Rangeele. "I loved its music and its lyrics," she added. At the height of her career, Khanum, married renowned cameraman Riyaz Bokhari and left the music industry. She went on to have two daughters and two sons. Khanum spent the last few years of her life using a wheelchair and living with her sons in Lahore. One of her sons is the well-known cameraman Faisal Bokhari. </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <body>Liam Gallagher has said it was an easy decision to take part in a special concert in memory of The Charlatans' drummer Jon Brookes. Mr Brookes, 44, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour three years ago, died in August. The Charlatans will perform alongside other guests at the Royal Albert hall on Friday night in aid of The Brain Tumour Charity. Liam Gallagher described the musician as a "good lad". "He didn't have an ego, do you know what I mean? "I wouldn't claim to be his best mate and that. I only met him through the gigs we've done, but every time I met him I had a splendid time." Gallagher said he was on holiday at the time the concert was announced, but said he signed up straight away. He will be performing alongside fellow former Oasis band mates Andy Bell, Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and Chris Sharrock, as well as Jay Mehler, currently part of Gallagher's band Beady Eye. West Midlands indie band The Charlatans said they organised the gig as a "fitting tribute" to founding member Mr Brookes, originally from Staffordshire. Keyboard player Tony Rogers said in some ways the event would be a tough night, when the reality of their friend's death "will hit home". "He was always very upbeat. His illness never got on top of him, he never let it get to him. He was always very positive and never moaned," Rogers said. "It's not like he's gone really. It's like his spirit is still there. It will be a tough one I think, but every time you think of Jon it puts a smile on your face." The Brain Tumour Charity's chairman Andy Foote said: "One of our biggest challenges is raising awareness of the disease, because the general public are not aware of the facts and they're quite startling. "For example, brain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, yet less than 2% of funding that goes into cancer research goes into brain tumours." </body>

      <title>Veep star 'would relish' drama roles</title>
      <description>US actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US sitcom Seinfeld and political satire Veep, says she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles.</description>

      <body>Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US satire Veep, has said she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles. "I would love to spread my wings in that direction, why not?" the multiple Emmy winner told the BBC ahead of the release of her new film Enough Said. The comedy, which had its UK premiere at this year's London Film Festival, tells of a divorcee who finds love just as her daughter is leaving for college. Louis-Dreyfus won her fourth Emmy last month for her role in Veep. Created by Armando Iannucci of The Thick of It fame, the HBO show sees her play an ineffectual US vice president whose attempts to expand her role are continually thwarted. Though ostensibly a romantic comedy, Enough Said - the fifth film by writer-director Nicole Holofcener - has "a couple of very dramatic moments" according to its 52-year-old star. "They were a great joy to do even if they were painful," the actress explained. "I hope my fans will be happily surprised." The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September and is released in the UK on Friday, sees Louis-Dreyfus appear alongside James Gandolfini. The late star of The Sopranos plays Albert, a well-meaning man unaware his massage therapist girlfriend - the character Louis-Dreyfus plays - has taken on his vindictive ex-wife as a client. "I've never done anything as deceitful in my life but I understand why she does it," said the actress, who described her co-star as a "gentle giant" and a "dear, dear man". "This is a woman on the precipice who's been emotionally hijacked by herself. The dread and fear of her daughter's impending departure fuels this horrible thing she does." The scene in which her character's deception is exposed was both "tough" and "excruciating" to film, said the New Yorker, who is currently shooting the third season of Veep - a slang term for vice president. "But it was exciting to do something so dramatic about large human emotions." </body>

      <title>Mark Thompson recalled to face MPs</title>
      <description>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson is ordered to answer parliamentary questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped at a cost of £100m.</description>

      <body>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has been ordered to answer MPs' questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI). The project, which was designed to do away with tapes and digitise the BBC's archives, was abandoned in May at a cost of £98.4m The Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday it was "dismayed" by the collapse and would investigate further. It intends to ask Mr Thompson whether MPs were misled about the scheme. The former director general told the committee in February 2011 the DMI project was "on track" and there were "many programmes being made" with it. He also ruled out any "significant further delays" in its introduction, and added: "I think you are going to see a broader deployment of the system across the BBC than we expected, because of the enthusiasm with which it is being used". Later that month, the National Audit Office reported DMI had "progressed well" after the BBC took control of the project from technology firm Siemens. However in May this year, the entire initiative was scrapped. The BBC Trust said it had "delivered little or no assets" and should be shut down to prevent "throwing good money after bad". "This is, on a personal level, probably the most seriously embarrassing thing I've ever seen," BBC Trustee Anthony Fry told the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in June. In a statement, Mr Thompson insisted his 2011 testimony had been given "honestly and in good faith". He added: "I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project." No date has been set for his appearance in front of the committee, although the meeting will not take place until next year. It will be the second time he has been called to answer MPs questions since becoming chief executive of the New York Times, following his previous testimony on BBC management pay-offs in September. A spokesman for the committee said Mr Thompson was "happy to come and give evidence" again, although he may appear by video link if necessary - and that other witnesses would also be called. The BBC Trust has asked accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers to complete an independent review into the DMI failure. The National Audit Office may also compile a report next year. </body>

      <body>Actor Sir Ben Kingsley reminisced about his time filming Gandhi - and how its director Richard Attenborough gave him 'all the time in the world' to play the leading role. Talking to Andrew Marr, Sir Ben said the reassurance and composure of Lord Attenborough meant he was able to get the shot he wanted, despite fading light, for the 1982 biopic of the Indian leader. Sir Ben also explained the tattoos he sports in Ender's Game, his latest film which opens on 25 October, represent the character's Maori-warrior lineage.

      <title>Q&amp;A: The Voice winner Andrea Begley</title>
      <description>Voice winner Andrea Begley on her chart ambitions and how she would change the show</description>

      <body>Andrea Begley only won the second series of The Voice in June, but her album is already finished. The 27-year-old says she wants to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor, Leanne Mitchell - who waited a year to release an album, only to see it stall at number 134 in the UK charts. The time constraints mean Begley's debut mostly consists of cover versions, with Bruce Springsteen's Dancing In The Dark and Jake Bugg's Lightning Bolt among the songs to receive an acoustic makeover. But Begley also sings two original songs, including the title track, The Message. The former law student, who has only 10% vision, talked to the BBC about recording her vocals "line by line"; will.i.am's protest at her victory on The Voice (he tweeted he was "sad" and "perplexed"); and how she would change the show next year. Has it been a rush to get your album ready? Obviously, we couldn't plan for what happened beyond the show, because nobody knew what the result was going to be - but I always had ideas in my head about things I'd like to do if I ever did an album. So we started with that kind of blank page and went from there. What we tried to do was get some stuff from the show, and also do covers of songs I have loved over the years. We knew it was important to get out an album before Christmas. Why was that? From the point of view of what happened last year: Everyone knows things didn't go quite as well as they might have done. Leaving the winner's album for so long, it didn't keep the momentum. For me, it was important to make a good job of it, but not take so long that people had forgotten about me. Do you think you got the balance right? Hopefully! I think the album captures different sides of me as an artist. Within the show I only really got to show a certain angle. What do you mean by that? I suppose what I mean is you've only got a certain number of performances, and you've got a time limit as well. I guess, for me, beyond the show it's great to show I can sing all kinds of things. How long was the time limit? It's quite short. One of them was 1 minute 10 seconds. You find ways and means around it. It's all in the edit - picking out the bits people like to listen to. But there's no doubt about it, you are under a constraint. It's nice to have the luxury of doing a full song on the album! Your audition song (Sarah McLachlan's Angel) is on the album. How far in advance did you decide to perform it on the show? Pretty much from the get-go. As soon as I met the production team, I said: 'This is the kind of song I'd like to do. It isn't too over-played, it isn't too well-known, but it suits my style and I can sing it very well.' I very much nailed my colours to the mast with that song - and it bore out in the end. It really worked. A lot of people, including will.i.am, said they were disappointed you beat Leah McFall. How did that make you feel? Music is subjective and everyone has their own opinion. You'll always get people who'll prefer my music to what Leah or Will are into. The thing is, I love all kinds of music. I love the stuff that Will does, so it was never case of me versus them. Will's tweet is very much in the past. He spoke to me afterwards and said 'look, it's just because I wanted my act to win, and I would have supported you if you'd been my act'. Some people suggested you won because you're visually impaired. Was that a shock? It's a little bit disappointing, I guess, if people go down the route of saying I only won because I had a story. That's not giving the public the credit it's due. People don't vote for those reasons - it's a singing show, at the end of the day, and I was there on the same basis as everyone else. I never, ever tried to make out that I was there because I was visually impaired. Did your law degree come in handy when you were reading your recording contract? [Laughs] It's always helpful, in the sense that it keeps your wits about you. But my experience was a long way off the world of showbusiness. How does singing in the studio compare to live performances? It's very different. Studio days are tiring because you're standing in front of a microphone for hours on end. People don't realise how meticulous it is. You record everything line by line by line by line. But then, when you hear it back, you realise how much you need to focus on each individual part to get it right. Your aunt is country singer Philomena Begley. Did she give you any tips? I've had quite a lot of contact with my aunt in the past couple of months, and she's been keeping me advised of songs, and things I should watch out for. She's very excited about the album coming out. There's a little bit of country on it, so she'll be happy with that. What did she tell you to watch out for? Just to make sure I get my opinions across. I'm always pretty determined anyway, and I speak my mind. So I definitely did that. What was the biggest argument you had? Did you have to pull a diva strop? Not yet - but I'm working on it. I want a newborn kitten in every dressing room! You played a concert with Evelyn Glennie for people with sensory disabilities in over the summer. What was that like? It was done in conjunction with the RNIB and Action for Hearing Loss. My set was made accessible to people with hearing loss by having sign interpreters there, so I just had to make sure I stuck to the set list and did all the lyrics in the correct order! It's easy to assume that people with hearing loss wouldn't get anything from a concert, but I guess there's a visceral, physical element to live music. Of course, and obviously you've got all the visual aspects of watching the band. If you've got some level of hearing, you can pick up some of the concert and enjoy it. It's the same for me if I go to see a film. I won't necessarily get all the visuals, but it's still an experience - going out to the cinema and the big screen, and all that. Has going to the cinema become more accessible with things like audio description? It's definitely improving, although audio description is nowhere near the level I think it should be. Someone asked me recently what I felt was the single biggest problem for people with visual impairment. From my point of view, I'd like to get people to understand what visual impairment is, so that if they come across someone with a stick or a dog, that they know not to freak out or ask silly questions. Does that happen a lot? I run into it very rarely, but you do get it sometimes. People have come up and shouted loudly at me. They must have thought my ears didn't work, as well as my eyes! Finally - what do you think of the new line-up on The Voice? I'm excited. It's good to give it a fresh look. I know some people think Danny and Jessie leaving might be a little too much disruption. But the new setting will keep viewers' interest alive. Everybody wants to see what kind of banter there'll be between the new coaches. If you were auditioning this year, whose team would you want to be on? I don't know! Possibly Tom, or Kylie. I think will.i.am's going to have a lot of competition from her. She has a sparkle and personality that'll be really good for the show. And if they put you in charge, what would you change? For me, definitely, the knock-out rounds were absolutely horrendous. So I'd make them do two knock-out rounds, just to be a little bit devious. You'd make it harder! I'd just like to fully test them. See if they're up to the challenge. Andrea Begley's album, The Message, is out on Monday, 21 October. </body>

      <title>Theatres make drama out of a crisis</title>
      <description>What does the future hold for British theatre?</description>

      <body>The UK Theatre Awards, which were handed out on Sunday, proved that top-class theatre can be found across the UK, despite warnings about the consequences of funding cuts. So is regional theatre in rude health or in crisis? Here, figures from the stage community assess the state of British theatre and look to the future. Sheffield Theatres led the winners at the UK Theatre Awards, with four prizes. The complex, which comprises three auditoria, was named the best theatre outside London by The Stage newspaper earlier this year. What is the mood in British theatre - doom and gloom or celebration? I'd be lying if I didn't say there was a measure of doom and gloom because we're all facing more and more cuts. However at the same time it's really important that we do celebrate the vibrancy, and that actually we're in rude health. What is your biggest challenge? Cuts. We pride ourselves on being an integral part [of the city]. We have a loyal audience and we want to keep putting on challenging, provoking stuff, as well as entertaining stuff. If we continue to get cut more and more then inevitably something has to give. Have cuts had any impact on what gets on stage? Of course. We have to look at how many new plays we can do a year. What are the risky plays we can do in the year? We want to continue doing experimental work - but at the same time we have to look at how we programme the larger spaces. Erica Whyman won a UK Theatre Award for best children's show for The Borrowers, her last show as artistic director of Northern Stage in Newcastle before moving to the RSC. Sum up the health of British theatre. British theatre is in a pretty healthy state, particularly artistically. Austere times can sometimes put a fire in one's belly and I think that's happened. There are some great new voices coming through. And there's a political bite to some of our work. At the same time, it's been a very tough year. What is the biggest challenge facing UK theatres? There is the economic challenge, both for audiences and theatres. The other challenge is that audiences' lives have changed. The award for The Borrowers is lovely because [we must] reach young people and make sure they have a passion for live theatre in a world where they're surrounded by screens. Give me the name of me one to watch - a talent you are excited about. Chris Thorpe is a writer, a director and a performer, and I think in some interesting way he's the future. He moves between those roles and he's writing very provocative and daring work. A collaborator of Chris's is Lucy Ellinson. She is also a performer, devising work, campaigning politically and she's also the future. There's a generation who don't see these hierarchical roles as any kind of barrier. They just make the work they want to make and they're intent on finding a new, really engaged audience. What is your biggest challenge? It's a big theatre and it's quite expensive to run so it's keeping the ability to take risks. Even a musical last year that [we thought] was a sure-fire hit suddenly wasn't, so you've got to keep your head above the water and be very clever with your programming. Was that Finding Neverland? No. I thought that was the risk. But the producer Harvey Weinstein helped us sell that well. Our Christmas show [Hello, Dolly!], which we thought would do well, didn't do as well. What do you learn from that? This Christmas we're doing Chicago and we're back on track. Clearly the public want sexy and new but familiar titles. Not old titles. If I did Oklahoma! we'd be empty. If they don't come this year, we will be in trouble. Tell me one to watch. A choreographer - Drew McOnie. He announced his own company last week, so he's following Matthew Bourne's footsteps. We're going to premiere his new dance piece called Drunk in the spring. What has gone down well at the Royal Exchange this year? What has struck a chord, which is encouraging, is serious plays that are very warm and passionate. Plays like Accrington Pals, To Kill A Mockingbird and All My Sons have really connected with our audiences. People seem to want warm, robust, humanistic dramas. Have funding cuts made any difference to your shows? No, we're absolutely determined not to let that happen. Obviously any theatre like ours depends a bit on how box office income is generated. So if we find that we can't quite generate enough box office income it will probably affect your programme choices at some point, but our attitude is always to make the most exciting, vivid work. Tell me one to watch. A director named Max Webster, who we found through the regional theatre directors' scheme. We offered him To Kill A Mockingbird, which he did a really good production of, and he's returning to our theatre to do Orlando with Suranne Jones. How would you sum up the health of theatre? It's pretty healthy, regional theatre. The glory of it is that it's healthy despite the fact we're under enormous pressure from local authority funding as well as central government etc. Everyone's redoubled their efforts and is working so hard. It's healthier than you would expect. What's the best thing you've seen this year? Blanche McIntyre just won the best director's award and we're working with her at ETT next year. I went to see her The Seagull in Derby on a Saturday night and took my 14-year-old daughter and it was amazing. Absolutely glorious in every way. That's regional theatre at its best. What has gone down well this year? Lots of people have done lots of comedy. There's a real sense of, 'People don't want to be challenged too much in these austere times so let's put on something light and frothy'. Maybe we might look at it as the year of - I don't want to say froth - but a light-hearted, light-touch approach. People have steered clear - I find myself tempted to do the same - of anything too depressing. Have you noticed any trends in theatre this year? I think there's a considerable growth in ambition and willingness to risk-take on major stages outside London. Regional theatres across the board have started to take more risk with a greater sense of localism in their larger spaces. What's your biggest challenge? As the resources grow tighter, it's very easy to do fewer things better, which then don't cover the year, or do more things worse. We're trying to hold the [quality] level that we demand of our own work, but also keep the theatre alive and thrumming during the course of the year. Tell me one to watch I'm very excited by David Ireland, a writer. He's ready to write some very big plays. Cora Bissett, a director, has started stepping up to bigger stages. Her work is so human, joyful, popular and profoundly political. What state is regional theatre in? I think there is and always has been a great deal of dynamism in the regions. We work a lot with new writing and presenting new stories in different ways to challenge audiences, particularly in rural settings. Now more than ever there's a need for making theatre accessible to as wide a group of people as possible outside urban conurbations. Why? We've been in recession and people are making choices, particularly with disposable income, and if we can take work to people in walking distance of where they live and involve wider communities then that strips one of the barriers to entry. What's your biggest challenge? We're funding a collaborative PhD with the University of Nottingham, where we're looking at challenging new forms of theatre for rural audiences. Rather than just touring safe work to rural locations we're looking at really how we can challenge and stretch audiences and not just play safe. </body>

      <title>Saving Mr Banks: the critics' view</title>
      <description>The critics' views of the London Film Festival's closing movie</description>

      <body>Emma Thompson plays Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks, which closed the London Film Festival on Sunday. It co-stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, in the story of Disney's long battle to buy the rights to the much-loved book, which was eventually turned into a musical starring Julie Andrews in 1964. Directed by The Blind Side's John Lee Hancock, the film takes us back into Travers' troubled childhood using frequent flashbacks to the Australian outback where she grew up. Saving Mr Banks is released on 29 November, but here is what the critics have been making of it: Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers, in a mesmerising and droll performance. Tom Hanks takes on the role of Disney, with a nailbrush moustache and unexpectedly gentle charm, his upbeat American optimism making Mrs Travers fit to burst with outrage in her buttoned-up tweed suit. Disney's relentlessly cheerful campaign to charm her is a delight to watch, as is our knowing take on lines such as 'Dick Van Dyke? A horrid idea'. In all a charming comedy. Apart from the dancing penguins of course, which Mrs Travers loathed. Read the full review here (subscription). The film is effective enough as a weepie. It boasts a fine performance from Thompson, who starts the movie in eccentric groove like a prickly version of Joyce Grenfell's Miss Gossage, but slowly and subtly reveals her character's vulnerabilities and complexities. However, Saving Mr. Banks also feels sanitised and disingenuous. Although the idea was initially developed by BBC Films, this is the Disney version of how Disney made Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is more a character study than a behind-the-scenes drama. Travers' character is rich and complex. The problem is that Hanks's Disney seems like a whitewash. Read the full review here. An enormous spoonful of sugar and the tiniest bit of medicine: it all goes down, just about. This is a warmly, in fact outrageously sentimental and self-congratulatory film from Disney about the master himself. Only a Disney film would have had the rights to the Mary Poppins clips and only a Disney film would have been permitted the possible lese-majesty of representing the great man on screen. Saving Mr Banks is an indulgent, overlong picture which is always on the verge of becoming a mess. Thankfully, reliable old Tom Hanks snaps his fingers and - spit, spot - everything more or less gets cleared away. Read the full review here. This clash (between Travers and Disney), with some of the real-life antagonism glossed over, has been reworked into a cat-and-mouse game that often resembles a seduction. Obviously, this gets played for laughs - many of them good ones. No opportunity is lost to highlight the differences in world-view between these two. But it's Thompson as the heroically unbiddable Travers who makes the most of it; her bravura performance effectively dominates the film. Pitching her delivery somewhere between Nanny McPhee and Miss Jean Brodie, Thompson perfectly embodies Travers's air of disapproval and distaste. Read the full review here . Somewhere, Uncle Walt is smiling. Thick with affection for Hollywood's most literal "dream factory" and wry in its depiction of the studio filmmaking process, director John Lee Hancock's (film) should earn far more than tuppence from holiday audiences - and from awards voters who can scarcely resist this sort of mash note to the magic of movies (eg Argo, The Artist). If 2007's Enchanted remains undisputed as the great, impish, postmodern riff on Disney iconography, Saving Mr Banks is the unapologetically retro valentine Disney himself might have made. It's a bit square, never particularly surprising, yet very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention - the Outback girl refashioned as a prim and proper British lady, the Missouri farm boy who turned himself into a cross between Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. Read the full review here. In a part once mooted for Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson takes charge of the central role of the waspish PL Travers with an authority that makes you wonder how anybody else could ever have been considered. The twinkly-eyed, avuncular figure incarnated by a mustachioed Hanks - who only for a fleeting moment shows off a glower worthy of a mafia crime boss ordering a hit - couldn't be further from the negative analyses of Disney depicted in, say, Richard Schickel's scathing biography The Disney Version or the recent Philip Glass opera The Perfect American. Some will no doubt call this a whitewash, but Saving Mr. Banks presents a grittier version of Disney than one might have expected 10 or even five years ago... Heck, they even show him smoking, and that's way worse than being an FBI informant these days. Read the full review here. </body>

      <body>Brian Sibley is one of writing's multi-hyphenates. He is a prolific and award-winning writer of radio drama, such as Radio 4's acclaimed Lord of the Rings adaptations. He has written plays of his own and many books focusing on film. The subjects of his biographies range from CS Lewis to Mickey Mouse. In fact, a love of Disney has been central since childhood. At home his walls are plastered with Disney artwork. "In the 1980s, it was exciting to be flown over to LA to sit in script conferences at Disney, working on what looked like a marvellous project - the studio's second Poppins movie." Though the screenplay he wrote with PL Travers was never made, he looks back on the experience fondly. And he's in a unique position to explain what she really thought about the 1964 film. "I first corresponded with Pamela Travers in the 1970s, when I was writing a book about Walt Disney. I didn't get to meet her for a decade but when finally we met it quickly became a friendship. "Since she died, Pamela's been painted as an old dragon but it's not true: I'd go round for tea on a Sunday and she was great company. Writing with her turned out to be an eccentric experience but that was because she remained proprietorial about Mary Poppins. "But why shouldn't she be? - it was her creation. Though Pamela, who was very spiritual, would probably have said that the character had been given to her." The first Poppins film had been a massive hit. "But in some ways it's quite a loose adaptation, " Brian Sibley says. "Her books were really collections of free-standing short stories. The first film used elements both of the original Mary Poppins book (published 1934) and the second one, Mary Poppins Comes Back. "The Disney studio had been very keen to make a sequel but Pamela always said no. One Sunday we were having tea when she mentioned they'd been in contact. She described the latest idea to me and said she was about to reject it." "I said it was a pity there couldn't be a new film - so many people had loved the Mary Poppins character. Pamela said 'Oh I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.' And she paused. 'If it were you dear that would be different." "So I wrote a letter to Roy Disney (Walt's nephew, by now in charge) who I had met a few times. This was the 1980s and people still wrote letters. I told him there might be a chance of making the film. After a couple of days I got news Roy was sending someone to London to talk to me. Within a fortnight we were working on an outline." The project was Mary Poppins Comes Back, based on those parts of Travers' second book unused in 1964. Disney contracted Sibley and Travers to supply a treatment which they then set to work to expand. "For months I would sit and talk with Pamela at her home in Chelsea about the ideas I had. Then she would give me notes on what Mary Poppins would or would not do and think. She was very particular, even down to how a line should be said. I recorded her on tape and went away. Of course I then wrote what I needed to write - but I always bore her comments in mind. I would give her my script pages and she would write notes all over it. Some parts came back with 'no No NO!' scrawled all over the page. But she also said when she liked what I'd written." Sibley thinks they managed to find a balance between what Travers had written in her books and what the Poppins character then became in the film. But he also sensed a cloud looming over the movie's chances of getting made - the thorny issue of casting. "It was more than twenty years since the original so who could play Mary? Julie Andrews was no longer in her twenties and she had moved a long way from the My Fair Lady - Sound of Music stage of her career. Disney made an approach but it came to nothing. And who could ever have played Mary Poppins half as well?" Casting the world's most famous nanny was not the only quandary. "In our screenplay there was no longer a Bert (as played by Dick van Dyke). Instead there was Bert's brother, who had a similar function of being Mary's friend and possible admirer. Finding a Bert replacement was almost as tricky as re-casting the lead role. "I remember sitting in a restaurant on Rodeo Drive listening to an executive explain they thought Michael Jackson might be right for the part. Bear in mind this was an ice-cream seller in a park in Edwardian London. Or maybe it would have worked - who knows?" And contrary to popular belief, Sibley insists it's untrue that PL Travers hated the original film. "She may have mellowed in her views by the time I knew her but she knew there were good things in it. When we got down to work I thought it would be a good idea if we watched the original film first so I arranged a private screening. "I asked Pamela how long it was since she'd seen Poppins - this was the mid-1980s. She said 'Well not since the premiere, obviously'. I was astonished she hadn't seen this hugely famous film for more than twenty years. But Pamela didn't have a video or even a TV set. "Throughout the film she gave me notes. There were one or two moments where she said 'Oh that's terrible'. But there were more where she got excited at what was up there on screen. She patted my hand and said 'Oh we must remember that, that's excellent, I like that bit very much...' And that's how we began to build our screenplay." Eventually the sequel fell victim to a combination of inherent casting problems and the fact that new executives were running Disney. "But I treasured my time working with PL Travers," Sibley says. "And we stayed in touch almost until she died. She was demanding as a friend. But she had great wisdom and great knowledge of so many things: literature, life, love, faith. She was prickly and difficult at times. But she was also someone of a towering intellect whose friendship I really valued." </body>

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on playing spin doctors and screen legends</description>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth deal deadline approaches</title>
      <description>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos.</description>

      <body>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos. The firm said that, by Sunday, it had received about 300 positive returns out of a workforce of 1,350. But the Unite union said it had been given more than 500 forms rejecting the offer on pay and pensions. The union has asked its 1,100 members at Grangemouth not to hand the forms to Ineos. It has accused the company of giving workers an ultimatum of accepting worse pay and conditions or losing their job. The 2.6 square-mile refinery and petrochemical site was shut down ahead of a planned strike by Unite members. It remains closed despite the 48-hour strike, which had been due to begin on Sunday, being called off. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. Calum MacLean, chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the company had received "around 300" forms by Sunday. Mr MacLean said he expected most of the returns to come in on Monday, and he "remained pretty confident" there would be strong support for the company from workers. He added: "Getting the plant back up and running again is not about necessarily the number of people, albeit that will influence when we can start it. "What is important here is that we have asked the unions to give us an assurance that there will be no strike action during the consultation period, which is the 45 to 60 days when we are going to sit down and negotiate with the employees and talk about the changes we are trying to impose. "People need to realise that this site has lost £150m per year for the last four years. It has got a pension fund which is £200m in deficit and it is on the point of going bust. "If it wasn't because of the support of the shareholders, who are funding those losses, then there is a very, very serious situation here which means the site may not start up again". Ineos has put forward what it calls a survival plan for Grangemouth and warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. These changes were detailed in letters sent to staff at the end of last week. They include freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support its survival plan at this stage will receive a transitional payment of up to £15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Unite said it had strongly advised its members at Grangemouth not to return the forms backing the changes to their contract. It accused Ineos of "bribes and blackmail". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, told Good Morning Scotland: "We have continuously given assurances of no strikes from now up until December. "In fact yesterday (Sunday), when we had a rally here, I gave a commitment that we would have no strikes for however long it took to allow negotiations to take place between ourselves and Ineos on the survival plan. We are not imposing any conditions. "Ineos wants to come to the negotiating table at the same time as threatening our members and threatening people here with the sack in 45 days. You can't negotiate and impose at the same time." Mr Rafferty said he expected the majority of workers have would reject the new pay and conditions. First Minister Alex Salmond repeated his calls for Ineos to "fire up the plant" and for Unite to commit to a "no strike - without strings - guarantee" at the SNP conference in Perth. Ineos shareholders are due to discuss the future of the complex on Tuesday. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who is scheduled to meet with Ineos later this week, urged the company to "withdraw the ultimatums delivered to the workforce". She said: "The company should also undertake to immediately reopen the plant and return to production and both the union and the company should return to meaningful talks, with Acas if necessary, to deliver a solution to this matter which has serious consequences for Scotland and the UK." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Union rejects teaching changes</title>
      <description>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions</description>

      <body>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions. EIS members voted against the changes by 59% to 41% in a consultative ballot. The proposals included greater flexibility over working, and changes to the things teachers should and should not be responsible for. There were also some changes to the list of agreed duties of things which should or should not be done by teachers. The EIS expects the current pay offer for teachers to now be withdrawn. The proposed changes were negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) following the publication of the McCormac Report on teacher employment. Among the proposals were greater flexibility over working time. For example a teacher might spend two hours more with students one week but have two hours less the next to balance this out. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has been consistent in stating that any proposals arising from discussion of the McCormac report would be subject to a ballot of our members. "We have now completed that process and the result is a clear rejection by Scotland's teachers of the suggested changes to working conditions. "As always, the EIS is listening to its members and will make teachers' views known to the management side at the forthcoming meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers". The union said the rejection of the proposed changes to working conditions is also likely to have an impact on the agreed 1% pay offer for teachers in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Local government body Cosla had indicated that the 1% pay offer could be withdrawn if teachers rejected the changes to working conditions. The current pay offer also included improvements to the payment for short term supply teachers, a move being funded by Scottish government. Mr Flanagan added: "We will be seeking constructive dialogue with both Cosla and Scottish government on what happens next. "No one wishes to see disruption in our schools, particularly at such a crucial phase in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, so we will await discussion of the issues at the SNCT before deciding how to proceed. "The ballot result, however, is indicative of the mood of teachers who after a two year pay freeze, increased pension contributions and in the face of excessive workload have simply said, 'Enough is enough.'" Councillor Billy Hendry, Cosla's human resources spokesman, said: "Firstly I am disappointed with the outcome of the EIS ballot. Secondly I am very disappointed that our teaching workforce will now not have their back dated pay in their pay packets before Christmas. "The simple fact is that as employers we have put together the very best components of an offer in agreement with the unions and the Scottish government. "The offer is a package and is not open to any one of the three parties to cherry pick the bits that they like best and reject the rest. "This offer remains on the table and will do so during our meeting with the EIS tomorrow."  </body>

      <title>'High demand' for Games tickets sale</title>
      <description>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow sees "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking.</description>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <body>Two Boeing 747s came close to crashing over Scotland after the pilots failed to follow instructions for avoiding a collision, a report has found. The near miss on happened about 40 miles north of Glasgow on 23 June. A report by the UK Airprox Board found that all four pilots had mistakenly followed instructions meant for the other crew. At one point, the aircraft were just 4.5 miles apart horizontally and only 100ft vertically. The report noted that both planes were under the guidance of the National Air Traffic Control Centre at Prestwick. One of the pilots requested to climb to the plane's cruising height for a transatlantic crossing and was given clearance. Controllers at Prestwick noticed that this "resulted in a potential confliction" with the other Boeing 747 and "took timely action in issuing appropriate avoiding instructions" to both pilots. The report noted: "Had the pilots complied with these instructions, simulation indicated that separation would not have been lost. "It was apparent that both crews had taken each others' instructions, and the board found it hard to determine why this had occurred," the report stated. "The board was surprised that all four pilots had misheard or misinterpreted the avoiding action instructions despite at least one of the crews reading them back correctly." The report concluded: "The pilots of the aircraft on converging tracks flew into conflict because, although they acknowledged timely avoiding action, they did not follow it." The board found that a contributory factor was that air traffic controllers "climbed the aircraft to the same level". </body>

      <body>A Royal Navy helicopter had to make an emergency landing in Glencoe because of an engine problem, it has emerged. The Sea King from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, in Ayrshire, landed near the Kings House Hotel on 13 October. The machine was kept under armed guard until it was airlifted from the scene on Friday by a Chinook helicopter. It was understood the Sea King's four crew were on a training exercise when the pilots were alerted to a fault with the helicopter's gear box. It was lifted away from an area near the hotel to the village of Glencoe on Friday. It was then secured to a trailer and transported by lorry to HMS Gannet. The helicopter is one of three at HMS Gannet. Royal Navy crews and helicopters based at Prestwick are regularly called out to make searches and rescues in remote parts of Scotland. </body>

      <body>A rapist's bid to hide his identity ahead of a planned return to Scotland was rejected by judges who said his case should not avoid open justice. Stephen Fagan, 47, injected the woman with heroin and raped her in front of her eight-year-old son at her home in South Shields, near Newcastle, in 2006. He was jailed for 14 years but released on licence in September 2012. Fagan said his family would be at risk if his return was reported. The judges' written ruling emerged on Monday. The Court of Appeal dismissed Fagan's bid for anonymity and said the family of anyone who committed a serious sexual - or violent - offence might face a "hostile reaction". One appeal judge, Lord Justice Aikens, said there was "nothing in the position of Stephen Fagan" which could justify any derogation from the general principle of open justice. Appeal judges had ruled against Fagan, who comes from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, last month - but the reasons behind their decision were not published until Monday. The dispute over the publication of his name developed earlier this year after he began publicly-funded legal action in an attempt to win the right to live in Scotland following his release from prison on licence. Fagan, who wants to re-settle in Airdrie, said members of his family might become a "target of hostility" if his return was reported. His lawyers argued that there was a need to "prevent the risk of violence". In June, a High Court judge ruled that Fagan could be named - but he imposed a temporary reporting ban until the case had been analysed by the Court of Appeal. Appeal judges then also ruled that Fagan could be named - at the end of a hearing in London in September - and lifted the reporting ban. The thinking behind their decision was explained in the written ruling published on Monday. </body>

      <body>A man involved a three-hour stand-off with police after dousing himself in petrol in a health centre has avoided a jail sentence. John McCarry, 50, was upset at a cut in his benefits when he threatened to set fire to himself and the building. A doctor raised the alarm and staff and patients were evacuated from Galashiels Health Centre in February this year. At Selkirk Sheriff Court, McCarry was given a six-month community payback order with a supervision requirement. He was also ordered to engage with the mental health organisation Penumbra. The court heard how McCarry had reacted angrily when Job Centre officials had declared him fit to work and told him he would be getting his benefits stopped. He headed straight for his home town's health centre where he went into a doctor's consulting room and poured a litre of petrol over his head. McCarry then held a half-full plastic bottle in one hand and a lighter in the other. After the building was evacuated, it was surrounded by the emergency services. A three-hour stand-off then followed before specially-trained negotiators finally convinced McCarry to give up the bottle containing petrol and throw the lighter to the ground. He had previously admitted committing a breach of the peace at the health centre. </body>

      <body>People across Scotland should begin preparations for severe winter weather, the Scottish government has urged. The message comes as Transport Minster Keith Brown launches the Ready for Winter campaign. Mr Brown stressed that preparations for extreme weather events were good, but some motorists still did not plan enough for severe conditions. The new campaign also encourages people to look out for others, especially the more vulnerable. It includes findings from a survey carried out jointly by the British Red Cross and the Scottish government. It showed an increase in public preparedness for extreme weather, with most people concerned about power cuts and being cut off from their water supply. However, it revealed many car owners thought they were doing enough just by having an ice scraper and de-icer. In the past few years, parts of Scotland have been hit by high winds, blizzards and severe sub-zero temperatures. Mr Brown said: "With the clocks changing next week, the campaign calls on everyone to use the extra hour to get ready in the home, before a journey, at our place of work and in our communities. "This will serve us well not just throughout the winter months, but all year round and in a range of emergency situations. "As we have seen in Scotland, severe weather can strike quickly and at any time of year. In March, we saw the impact of severe snowstorms on communities in Arran, Kintyre and Dumfries and Galloway." The Ready for Winter campaign includes a range of online resources, TV, radio and social media material. Online advice can be accessed at the Ready Scotland website. </body>

      <title>Teacher jailed for grooming boy</title>
      <description>A Glasgow teacher is jailed for two years after being convicted of sexually grooming a 13-year-old boy.</description>

      <body>A Glasgow teacher has been jailed for two years after being convicted of sexually grooming a 13-year-old boy. Peter McGinniss, 48, befriended the boy and his family after meeting him at the school where he taught. He took them on trips during the school holidays and took the boy on overnight stays to a hotel and a log cabin. McGinniss was found guilty of sexually grooming the boy between June 2009 and March 2010. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years. Jailing him at Glasgow Sheriff Court, Sheriff John McCormick said McGinniss was a teacher who "inveigled" himself in to the family of the boy and said it "was achieved with careful manipulation". During the trial, the court heard that McGinniss, an English teacher from Glasgow, had offered the boy extra help with his school work in June 2009. McGinniss went on to invite him to his home, where he spent time alone with him. He took the boy and his family on trips during the school holidays. He also took the boy on overnight stays to a hotel and a log cabin, and bought him gifts. The teenager said that he would go to McGinniss' home where they would drink alcohol, and that he went away overnight with him on two occasions and shared a room with the teacher. McGinniss had denied the charge and claimed he was a "friend of the family" and was not spending time with them as the boy's teacher. Procurator fiscal depute Cassie Scott had asked McGinniss: "Do you find it appropriate to take one of your pupils away for the night to a log cabin?" He said: "In the circumstances at the time I found it appropriate." He also confirmed he took the teenager to a hotel for a night and shared a room with him on one occasion. The court heard that in March 2010 the boy told a family member what had been going on and the matter was reported to the authorities. </body>

      <title>Pay 'on the rise' for new recruits</title>
      <description>The latest Bank of Scotland jobs report shows pay rising for new recruits and continued improvement in permanent and temporary placements.</description>

      <body>Pay for new recruits is on the rise, according to the latest market report from Bank of Scotland. There has also been a continued improvement in permanent and temporary placements, with the strongest prospects in Aberdeen. In other economic news, retailers saw a downturn in shopping last month. But, the Scottish Retail Consortium said this may be because household budgets were being managed cautiously ahead of the Christmas spend. Statistics published last week provided more evidence that pay increases for those in employment were falling behind inflation. The Bank of Scotland's jobs report for September suggested the answer may be to shift to a new job. Starting pay rose at the fastest pace in six years, and hourly pay for temporary jobs increased at a sharp pace too. Scottish recruiters reported a further increase in the number of candidates placed into permanent work in September. The rate of growth was marked, despite having eased from the survey-highs in the previous two months. About 40% of panellists placed a larger number of candidates into permanent work since August, and often linked this to greater client demand, the report said. The Bank of Scotland's labour market barometer picked up slightly in September, rising to 60.0 from 59.7 in August. The barometer is measured against a baseline of 50, with anything above that number representing an improvement in market conditions. Any number below 50 means a deterioration. With continued improvement in labour market conditions, vacancies grew most strongly in engineering and construction during September. Aberdeen saw the strongest growth in recruitment and the fastest rise in starting pay, thanks to big investments by oil and gas firms. Donald MacRae, chief economist at Bank of Scotland, said: "September's Labour Market Barometer showed a continuing improvement in Scottish job market conditions. "The number of people appointed to both permanent and temporary jobs increased while growth in vacancies was marked. "The Engineering and Construction sectors saw the highest rate of vacancy growth for almost two-and-a-half years. This is further welcome evidence of the strengthening of the recovery in the Scottish economy." Meanwhile, latest figures from the Scottish Retail Consortium provided evidence of an autumn stall in recovery for the high street and shopping centres. In September, shopper numbers in Scotland were 2.7% lower than a year ago - and down on the 0.3% decline seen in August 2013. For the UK as a whole footfall was down 2.7%. Fiona Moriarty, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: "It's disappointing to see Scottish shopper numbers have dropped significantly after a solid result in August. "While recent months have hinted at economic recovery, many of us are still cautious about making major purchases and may want to focus on managing budgets ahead of Christmas." She added: "There's been better news in recent weeks, with signs that customers are responding well to autumn collections and thoughts are turning to the festive season. "Retailers in Scotland will continue to monitor conditions closely as they gear up for the crucial Christmas trading period." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <body>Scottish Borders Council is being advised to award funds to help restore a giant three-dimensional map of Scotland in the village of Eddleston. Mapa Scotland has asked for £4,000 towards repair work on the map, built by Polish nationals in the 1970s. It was created to celebrate the links between Poland and Scotland and, especially, the contribution of Polish servicemen during World War II. SBC is being asked to agree funding to aid the upgrade works. The map was awarded B-listed status last year. It sits in an oval pool about 160ft (50m) wide and 5ft (1.5m) deep and once held gravity-fed water recreating rivers, lochs and seas. The map is currently the focus of a major restoration project in the grounds of the Barony Castle Hotel at Eddleston. The campaign to restore the map began in April 2010, when a group of volunteers constituted Mapa Scotland, a charitable trust which has secured Heritage Lottery funding to advance its plans. </body>

      <body>A woman has been sexually assaulted as she walked in a wooded area of Livingston. The woman, in her 20s, was attacked sometime between 02:00 and 04:00 on Saturday, off the Loan Path between Sutherland Way and Waverley Crescent. Her attacker was white, in his early 20s, 6ft tall, of slim build, with short dark brown hair. He was wearing dark coloured jeans and a cream coloured top. The woman was walking home alone when she was attacked. Det Insp Derek Long, of Police Scotland, appealed for anyone with information about the attack to come forward. He said: "The victim had been in the Grand Central nightclub, and on leaving made her way home via the path that runs near Camps Rigg and Raeburn Rigg, adjacent to the main Edinburgh to Glasgow railway line, and then parallel to Waverley Crescent. "It was when she reached the stretch of walkway running between Waverley Crescent and Sutherland Way, known locally as the Loan Path, she was assaulted. "As you can imagine the victim has been left in a state of shock and distress as a result of her ordeal, and we are appealing for any information that can help our inquiries. "It is possible that the suspect had also been in Grand Central nightclub, and we want anyone who was in the nightclub, who thinks they saw him there, to get in touch immediately. "We are also keen to speak to any local residents living near the scene who saw or heard anything suspicious in the early hours of this morning. "We believe the victim had screamed during the assault, and we are keen to speak to residents, particularly those in Waverley Crescent, which is nearby, who may have information that can assist us." </body>

Cocker spaniel Midge was reported missing by her distressed owners at Roslin Glen at about 11:40 on Sunday. The dog had fallen 60ft down a sheer drop by the side of the North Esk river, the fire service said. A spokeswoman urged dog owners to keep their pets "in sight or on a lead" in areas where there may be dangers. The cocker spaniel managed to scramble out of the river up to a ledge about 30ft down from the top. Seven fire appliances, police and the Scottish SPCA were involved in the rescue mission. The Scottish Fire and Rescue spokeswoman said Midge was reunited with her owners after specialist line and water rescue crews managed to lift the puppy off the ledge. </body>

      <body>Thousands of rabbits, including animals that caused a landslide that blocked a road, are to be culled on a small Hebridean island. National Trust for Scotland (NTS) estimates there are more than 16,000 rabbits on Canna. The burrowing animals have been blamed for causing a landslide that affected a main route on the isle and for damaging archaeological sites. NTS is to put out to tender a contract to control rabbit numbers. Work to exterminate rats on Canna was completed in 2008. Rats were blamed for eating the eggs and chicks of ground-nesting seabirds, seriously affecting their population. Pest controllers from New Zealand were brought in to deal with thousands of rats, using poison and traps. The rodents first arrived on the island on ships about 100 years ago. They had also posed a threat to the island's rare wood mice, 130 of which were transferred to Edinburgh Zoo before the cull. However, rabbits will not be completely wiped out because they provide food to eagles that nest on Canna. NTS said: "There are concerns about the impact that the population is having on the island, given the recent landslide. "Following advice from a specialist wildlife advisor, we are about to go out to tender for a contractor to undertake control work on the island. "The intention is that much of this work could be carried out before the end of the year. "The overall plan is to get the population down to manageable and sustainable levels." </body>

      <description>Air accident investigators say a reduction in air speed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.</description>

      <body>Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots. Four people died when the Super Puma crashed on approach to Sumburgh Airport on 23 August. The ongoing Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigation has so far found no evidence of a technical fault. The investigation will now focus on the effectiveness of pilot monitoring of instruments and the training of crews. An interim report published by the AAIB said that, as the helicopter approached to within 2.3 nautical miles of the airport, the commander noted that its airspeed had reduced to 80 knots. The commander increased the collective pitch, intending to maintain the speed. But the helicopter's airspeed reduced to below 80 knots, unobserved by the crew. A short time later, there was an automated audio call of "check height", which was acknowledged by the commander, and then a comment by the co-pilot to draw the commander's attention to the airspeed. At this time, the helicopter's airspeed was only 35 knots and reducing. There was then a second automated call of "check height" followed by a "100 feet" automated call. The report stated: "At some point the commander saw the sea, but he was unable to arrest the helicopter's descent and it struck the water shortly thereafter. "The co-pilot, realising that the helicopter was about to enter the water, armed the helicopter's flotation system. "After striking the surface the helicopter rapidly inverted, but remained afloat, the flotation equipment having successfully deployed". There were 18 people on board the helicopter at the time. Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, 57, from Winchester, lost their lives in the incident. The AAIB investigators also called for a review of rescue operations in the water surrounding Sumburgh Airport. A number of lifeboats and helicopters were sent to the scene, but the report said one rescue boat supposed to leave from a slipway to the west of the airport was delayed due to tidal conditions and instead had to leave from the south of the airport. It took almost an hour to reach the crash scene. The report said: "It is recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority reviews the risks associated with the current water rescue provision for the area of sea to the west of Sumburgh Airport and take appropriate action." Oonagh Werngren, operations director of Oil and Gas UK, said: "We now have a greater appreciation of what happened that day but we still don't fully understand why. "It is important, both for those directly involved in this tragedy and for all the men and women who work offshore, that the AAIB continues its very important task and reaches conclusion in a timely fashion. "It is also good to see that it is already making recommendations." She added: "In the meantime there are a number of different investigations under way and Oil and Gas UK will continue to work with the industry, the regulators and relevant bodies to ensure that the lessons are shared and the recommendations appropriately addressed." Les Linklater, team leader of Step Change in Safety, said: "This bulletin helps us to have a better understanding of what happened but not yet why it happened, and that will form part of the conclusion of the investigation. "It's very important that we all understand why this tragic accident happened and this will be a significant part of the on-going investigation." He added: "We will continue to monitor the investigation and act accordingly where safety improvements are identified. We are also continuing to work with the helicopter operators Bristow, Bond and CHC who have already instigated a review, which is focusing on safety-related processes." </body>

      <body>Aberdeen City Council has earmarked £20m to help transform the city centre, BBC Scotland has learned. However, following years of debate about how to make improvements, a final design has still not been drawn up. Businessman Sir Ian Wood has indicated that money from the Wood Family Trust could still be made available for a "transformational" project. Sir Ian originally offered £50m towards the £140m City Garden Project which was later rejected by the council. Apart from providing funding, the city council also hopes that Sir Ian will join a board created to come up with fresh proposals to redevelop the city centre. But the council's finance convenor, Willie Young, said the authority would press ahead with plans even without the guarantee of Sir Ian's money. He also said it would not be a second-class development if the entrepreneur did not come on board. Mr Young told BBC Scotland: "There will be other sources of funding. We will be speaking to the Scottish government, UK government and other businesses. "Just because Sir Ian Wood comes on board, or doesn't come on board, the city centre regeneration will happen." He added: "We want something that will deliver for the people of Aberdeen that won't divide the city. "What we've said is that there must be Victorian gardens within the city. Other than that we are happy to compromise. "What we are saying to Sir Ian Wood and to the business sector is 'if we are willing to compromise, you have to compromise as well'." New proposals by architect John Halliday have been put forward for a major renovation of Union Terrace Gardens. His design would see the gardens partly raised but remain sunken. The plans feature an arts centre, civic square, a new entrance to the railway station and the rail line and Denburn dual carriageway covered over to link to Belmont Street. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people are facing waiting lists of up to nine years for a local authority allotment, the Scottish Greens have said. In Edinburgh the wait can be between four and nine years, while in Aberdeen the wait can stretch up to seven years. The figures were disclosed in response to freedom of information requests by Green MSP Alison Johnstone to local authorities covering Scotland's cities. Ms Johnstone called for new "right-to-grow" legislation. There were 2,773 people in Edinburgh on the local authority allotment waiting list. In Aberdeen the figure was 279, while in Dundee it was 340 people. Glasgow City Council said it did not have its own waiting lists and Highland Council did not respond to the request, the Greens said. Perth and Kinross Council replied that it did not have any allotments and Stirling Council has only one site which has no waiting list. Ms Johnstone, MSP for Lothian and food spokeswoman for the Greens, also highlighted official statistics showing that almost 31% of Scotland's population lived within 500m of a derelict site last year. "These figures suggest Scotland needs right-to-grow legislation in the same way we have seen community groups being given the right to buy land that comes up for sale," she said. "I will be looking for opportunities in the forthcoming Community Empowerment Bill to give control to the increasing numbers of people looking to grow their own food because the demand is there, the land is there and the benefits are obvious." Scotland has more than 200 allotment sites, mostly council-owned. In 2008, the Scottish government asked public bodies to consider how they could free up land to increase the number of allotments in Scotland. Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "Growing your own food is continuing to grow in popularity and allotments provide a range of benefits such as an opportunity to learn new skills, an understanding of where our food comes from and better health. "We consulted earlier this year on plans to simplify Scotland's allotment rules, including using unused and underused assets. We are currently considering what changes could be made to the existing legislation and will set out our proposals in the coming weeks. " </body>

      <body>A new primary school which cost £9m to construct has opened in a village in the Scottish Borders. A pipe band led pupils and staff from the old West Linton Primary school to the new building. A ribbon-cutting was carried out by the two oldest children at the school - P7 pupils Rory Darling and Natasha Thorp - along with councillor Sandy Aitchison. He described it as a "state of the art" school which would benefit children in the area for "years to come". "The council has invested a significant amount of money in these first class facilities, which will provide an excellent learning environment for the pupils who are incredibly excited about their new surroundings," he said. Head teacher Hilary Elliott said everyone was delighted with the new building. "The children had high expectations regarding what they wanted their new school to provide and they communicated their ideas clearly at the beginning of the process," she said. "They said they wanted a bigger school with bigger classrooms, more smartboards and lots of natural light; they wanted a library, bigger cloakrooms, a bigger playground and a football pitch they could access every day. "The children have got what they asked for and they, and all staff, now look forward to enjoying the many benefits this wonderful new learning environment provides." </body>

      <body>Alastair Seeley has lost out to Stuart Easton in the battle for the British Supersport title at Brands Hatch. Carrickfergus rider Seeley closed the gap to four points on Easton after finishing second in Saturday's sprint. It all came down to the season's final race on Sunday and Easton was leading when the race was red-flagged, with Seeley back in third. Scotsman Easton, riding for Northern Ireland team Martrain Racing, won the series by 13 points from Seeley. Easton could only manage an 11th-placed finish in Saturday's sprint race, meaning that both riders were guaranteed the title if they won the final race feature. Easton was 0.322 seconds ahead of Seeley when the race was red-flagged, with sprint winner Richard Cooper finishing second. Glenn Irwin, also from Carrickfergus, was seventh in the sprint before coming in fifth on Sunday.  </body>

      <body>An 83-year-old woman has been robbed of a three figure sum of money after answering the door to bogus callers. Two men knocked on her door and demanded payment for roof repairs to her house - work that was never carried out. The suspects were described as being in their late 40s or early 50s, and wearing dark clothing. The incident occurred at her home in Monifieth, Dundee, on Sunday 13 October at about 16:00. Once the men were indoors, one of them entered the bedroom with the victim to inspect the work that had allegedly been carried out. She then turned round and discovered the man had left the room. When she returned to the living room, the woman noticed her handbag and purse containing the money were missing.

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <body>Scotland's justice secretary has voiced his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources. Kenny MacAskill told the SNP conference dropping the centuries-old requirement for corroboration meant people would no longer have to suffer in silence. Sections of the legal profession oppose the move and the SNP's Christine Grahame has urged caution. But Mr MacAskill said criminal law had to be brought into the 21st Century. Proposals to drop the general requirement for corroboration are part of a series of justice reforms which have been put forward by the Scottish government. Supporters say the plan could improve conviction rates in areas such as sex crime and domestic abuse cases. But opponents argue corroboration provides an important safeguard against miscarriages of justice. Addressing delegates in Perth, Mr MacAskill said: "We need to address the historic anomaly of the routine requirement for corroboration. "Those who suffer rape and other serious sexual assault are denied justice by it. "But it's not just the victims of these horrendous sexual crimes, but many others, whether children or the elderly - crimes committed without eyewitnesses." The justice secretary went on: "Of the latest shameful statistics on domestic abuse, 10% of crimes reported to the Crown couldn't be prosecuted because of the lack of corroboration. "And those were only the ones the police reported - many others didn't even make it to the fiscal's office as they knew the Crown couldn't pursue them." Mr MacAskill said the abolition of corroboration would come hand-in-hand with additional safeguards including a "qualitative and quantitive" test for prosecutions and increasing the majority required by juries for a conviction. He said: "Justice there must be and corroboration must go." Ms Grahame, convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party justice committee, which is scrutinising the government's proposals, has warned any changes must be for the benefit of the complainer and accused, not because they are "politically popular". </body>

      <body>Postgraduate students will be able to get a loan of up to £4,500 to help towards living expenses, the Scottish education secretary has announced. Mike Russell told the SNP conference that thousands of Scots students could apply for the assistance from 2015. As many as 5,000 undergraduates, mainly taking courses in science, technology, engineering and maths, could benefit. The low interest loans would only need repaid in line with the current student loan income threshold of £16,365. Cash for student bursaries will rise next year to £105m, meeting a call from the National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland for this to increase in line with inflation. In addition the minimum income students from poorer backgrounds get from loans and other financial support will also rise from £7,250 this year to £7,500 next year. NUS Scotland president Gordon Maloney hailed the package as a "big step forward". Mr Russell told SNP delegates in Perth that money for education was the "best investment Scotland can make in its future". He said the student support package would get "even better", adding: "I know that providing protection for inflation for further education students in the next academic year has been a key campaigning priority for the National Union of Students in Scotland." Mr Maloney welcomed the package, saying: "Too often, students in colleges and universities have to take on multiple part-time jobs, or go deep into commercial debt, to avoid dropping out. "While, of course, grants and bursaries would be better than loans, worst of all would be no increases in support at all." Mr Russell's announcement came as the SNP conference drew to a close. The event was followed by a rally in support of independence. Chief executive of the Yes Scotland campaign Blair Jenkins told the rally: "What unites us in the Yes campaign is that clear democratic principle that Scotland's future should be in Scotland's hands, that the best people to make decisions on what is right for our country are the people of Scotland themselves." </body>

      <title>Child psychologist provision warning</title>
      <description>A national steering group warns that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low.</description>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <body>Oil firm Cairn Energy has announced it is to start a year-long "high impact" exploration programme, with drilling to begin soon in Morocco. The company said the move would offer shareholders "exposure to material growth potential". A number of possible follow-up exploration prospects have also been mapped. Cairn said that a decision would be made soon on whether to drill the Pitu prospect off Greenland next year. The Edinburgh-based group's drilling programme in Greenland has so far been unsuccessful and has been strongly criticised by environmentalists. In a statement to the stock exchange, Cairn said that it remained in a "strong financial position ready to enter an intense operational period on the exploration front". Chief executive Simon Thomson said: "Cairn continues to follow its policy of maintaining appropriate balance sheet strength as it progresses its exploration and development programmes." The company also announced it would begin a share buy back programme of up to $300m (£186m). Cairn got shareholder approval for the move earlier in the year. </body>

      <body>Planning rules governing the extraction of shale gas and onshore oil in Scotland will be made tougher, the Scottish government has said. It believes there should be reinforced protection for communities near sites of new energy sources, including the controversial fracking method. Climate Change Minister Paul Wheelhouse also said he wanted to see buffer zones between sites and settlements. The new planning policy will come into force next year. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the changes, describing them as a "setback" for firms hoping to extract shale gas. Mr Wheelhouse made the announcement at the SNP conference in Perth. He said: "Any proposals for the extraction of unconventional oil and gas extraction are considered through the planning process and the appropriate regulatory regimes. "In considering such proposals it is important that the views of the local communities, and the impact on the environment are given due consideration in the planning process. "Today's announcement of a strengthening of the planning rules in relation to unconventional oil and gas, through provision of buffer zones, highlights that this government listens to local communities and the those calling for stronger environmental protection." He added that there were no "environmental permissions" at the current time which would allow hydraulic fracturing in Scotland. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "This is without doubt a setback for those hoping to exploit shale gas in Scotland. "We welcome this commitment and hope it is just the first of several steps ministers will take to begin to close the door on all new fossil fuels developments in Scotland. "In the interests of tackling climate change and delivering climate justice we urgently need to be leaving fossil fuels, including shale gas, in the ground." </body>

But defender Nelson posted a photograph of his own black eye and suggested the Celtic manager should "man-up". Striker Vine apologised to Lennon after suggesting that the Celtic boss had been "smoking something else". In his after-match media conference, Lennon had singled out a tackle by substitute Vine on debutant Darnell Fisher. "Read Sir Neil Lennon's comments regarding tackles in yesterday's game and said my tackle was 'rugby-esque'," Vine pointed out before referring to the Celtic manager's use of a tobacco product. "I mean, I know he likes the snus, but has he been smoking something else? "I hardly touched the boy and there were no 'reckless' tackles in the game. "Might get me mate Alan Shearer to send him another size 9 Umbro Speciali in the dish if he don't pipe down." Vine went on to admit that he had never met the former England captain, nor Lennon, personally despite his reference to an incident during a Newcastle-Leicester match. Responding to a tweet from Lennon asking "did I read that right?", Vine replied: "Was light-hearted, just thought your comment was poor, thought it was a good physical game. "Apologies obviously if you've taken offence." In his own tweets, Nelson revealed that his injury, picked up during a clash of heads with Amido Balde, could be more serious than mere bruising. "Possibly a little bit more than a black eye pal," he replied to one correspondent. Nelson - whose manager, Pat Fenlon, had urged his players "to be in Celtic's faces" - also took Lennon to task over his comments. "Certain people crying and moaning about tackles in the paper. Don't hear me complaining about this #ManUp," he said as he linked to the photo of his injury. "If it was a complaint, I would be saying it was a bad tackle and he meant it. It was just part of the game. "Sometimes people just need to accept results and not go searching for excuses #thatsfootball. "Only one player was seriously hurt by a tackle in the game #yourstruly. "End of the day, one player badly injured from a mistimed tackle/collision and it wasn't a Celtic player." Only Liam Craig and Ryan McGivern of Hibs were booked during a game that came four days before Celtic host Ajax in Champions League Group H. "I'm all for competitive football, no-one more than myself, but seriously, they were borderline tackles," Lennon had said. "I made my feelings pretty clear to the fourth official. I don't think it was any player target in particular, it was across the board." </body>

      <description>Virgil van Dijk says he will put thoughts of an international call-up aside as his Celtic side host Ajax in the Champions League.</description>

      <body>Virgil van Dijk has vowed not to wilt under the pressure of a possible international call-up as Celtic host Ajax in Champions League Group H. Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal is reportedly preparing a trip to Glasgow to watch the Celtic defender. "If he is coming then it will be great, of course, but I still want to play a good game just for myself and we will see what happens," said Van Dijk. "I just want to play my own game and not put any more pressure on myself." Celtic manager Neil Lennon has suggested that Van Dijk's performances since his summer transfer from Groningen merited a call to his country's squad ahead of next year's World Cup finals. "It is definitely a dream to play for the national team," said the 22-year-old, who has played for Netherlands Under-21s. "There are a lot of good players, but I have never been invited for the first team of Holland, so I have never had to think about it." Van Dijk enjoyed Saturday's 1-1 draw with Hibernian even though it left manager Neil Lennon angry at the home side's tactics. The Northern Irishman described some of the Edinburgh side's tackling as "shocking" and "reckless" , but Van Dijk said: "No, I didn't think it was too physical. "Some of the challenges definitely were tough, but we played a very good game. "We created a lot of chances and we should have scored two or three, but we didn't lose, so that was good." </body>

      <body>Edinburgh Capitals' player-coach Richard Hartmann has revealed changes are coming to the club after another weekend defeat. Narrow losses away to Braehead Clan on Saturday then at home to Fife Flyers on Sunday have left the club with only one win in 14 matches all season. Now the Slovakian has snapped following two more games where his team have surrendered leads. "This is not the way I want us to play and it doesn't work," said Hartmann. "The guys are playing as individuals and aren't sticking to the system. "The changes are coming as this isn't the team I've worked to build for the last two years. Our fans don't deserve what they're seeing. "It's completely unacceptable that we've lost matches after being in winning positions and we need to change the whole thing." Hartmann's frustration is understandable with the latest defeats making it five games in a row that the side has lost after initially holding a lead. Saturday's loss in Braehead came from penalty shots when Joel Champagne tucked away the decisive chance to give Clan the two points. Goals from Caps duo Curtis Leinweber and Tomas Horna were cancelled out by Shane Lust and debutant Neil Trimm as the Purple Army fought back. However, Champagne's decider kept the points in the west, leaving Edinburgh with the consolation of one point for taking the game past 60 minutes. Fife's visit to Murrayfield on Sunday came when the Flyers themselves were struggling for goals in the absence of a sharpshooter. Rok Pajic found the net on Saturday as Sheffield Steelers plundered a 4-1 win from Kirkcaldy. They soon made up for that on Sunday when Steven Gunn levelled Martin Cingel's opener for Edinburgh, with Jordan Fulton and Derek Roehl adding further goals. Cingel pulled it back to 3-2, but Jamie Wilson restored Flyers' two-goal advantage before Michal Dobron netted a wonder goal for Caps. But it wasn't enough. Fife's associate coach, Danny Stewart, indicated afterwards he wasn't happy with Matt Nickerson, who was kicked out of Sunday's game for abuse of the officials. "No fault to the referee, but Matt's an emotional guy and after losing Justin DaCosta through injury, we made it clear we needed our defence men," said Stewart. "We can't afford to lose guys at this point and he'd been playing well. But he put us in a hole and there's no excuse for that." Dundee Stars, meanwhile, fought hard as they racked up two more wins over the weekend. They needed penalty shots to overcome Hull Stingrays in Humberside on Saturday before edging past Braehead Clan in a Challenge Cup tie on Sunday. A double from Nikita Kashirsky along with goals from Jerry Pollastrone and Mike Wirll saw the Tayside men go the distance with the Stingrays. It needed Nico Sacchetti to pop up with a decisive penalty shot after a further period of overtime couldn't separate them following a 4-4 draw. Then Kashirsky and Pollastrone found the net in the second and third periods respectively as they went 2-0 up over an under-strength Braehead. Ryan Finnerty's side had four injuries to imports going into the game and, although Neil Trimm scored his second of the weekend, it wasn't enough for the Clan. RESULTS Saturday: Elite League/Challenge Cup Group A Braehead Clan 3-2 Edinburgh Capitals (PS) Elite League Fife Flyers 1-4 Sheffield Steelers Hull Stingrays 4-5 Dundee Stars (PS) Sunday: Elite League Edinburgh Capitals 3-4 Fife Flyers Challenge Cup Group A Dundee Stars 2-1 Braehead Clan </body>

      <title>Get weaving: Forgotten skill kept alive</title>
      <description>Forgotten jute and linen skills kept alive</description>

      <body>Thousands of people used to work in the linen and jute mills of Angus and Dundee but today it is largely consigned to the history books. Now a youth project in Forfar is introducing the almost forgotten skill of weaving to young people - and it is having the unexpected effect of improving community relations. From the 19th century thousands of men, women and children were employed in weaving - on hand looms and then in the factories. At its height, in the late 19th century, Dundee boasted about 60 jute mills and more than 50,000 workers were employed by the city's jute industry. Today weaving has almost completely disappeared. But this project is about much more than just remembering how it used to be, according to Dawn Mullady, the project worker at The Pitstop in Forfar. She says. "We have many generations working together on the project, which is unbelievably fantastic. "The joy of the project is that young people's eyes light up when the older generation come in to teach. "The older generation's eyes light up when they see the enthusiasm of the young people, so it's a win-win situation and it's a fantastic way of documenting what Forfar weavers' lifestyles were." Twenty-one-year-old Adele Douglas learns all about the intricacies of weaving at the Pitstop project. She says it is "magical". "I look at the older generation and think 'were you a weaver?," she says. "Was that woman a weaver or does she walk like a weaver or talk like a weaver? "I always think of that because it's them that made the history with weaving, we're just learning. "We could pass it down to our kids and our kids could probably pass it down to their kids. Yeah, I always think of the older generation differently now." Rab McMonagle has worked in the weaving industry for 34 years. He says: "When I started I was doing jute. I worked in the finishing department. I worked in the weaving department and then I went back to the finishing department." He now also helps teach the young people at The Pitstop project. Ron Scrimgeour is a member of the Nine Trades of Dundee. He is keen to keep the weaving heritage alive through work with projects like this. He says: "The whole area - Angus and Dundee - had thousands and thousands of people working in the mills, and, largely because it was considered an inferior trade, people kind of kept quiet about it. "Whereas people are now discovering that their grannies were weavers or spinners or winders and they're taking a pride in that. "And that's actually a major achievement for the weaver craft, that's one of the things that we like to do, is to keep the traditions and the heritage going." </body>

      <body>Nofal Khan and Ramish Safa are two young men from Karachi and are responsible for one of the latest chapters in Pakistan's cultural scene - the emergence of an indigenous comic book. Kachee Goliyan is Pakistan's first mass-produced comic. Launched in 2011 it has given young people in the country a new voice and means of expression. Kachee Goliyan follows the stories of JC and Sufi, two street smart teenagers tackling the issues of everyday life. Printing thousands of copies and with over 122,000 likes on Facebook, the work has captured the imagination of the country's comic fans. Ramish and Nofal came up with the idea for the comic during their long commutes to university. Now a team of graphic artists and designers work on the product with them. Like all good art, the comic allows the creatives to express an opinion on the world around them. Asked if he uses Kachee Goliyan to say things he couldn't say in person in Pakistan, Nofal responds: "Normally, people would come and do bad things to us if we stood up and started saying things, but in comics there is this way of saying very heavy things in a lighter manner." With the Pakistan leg of the Queen's Baton journey coming to an end, Nofal said he may be inspired to include some sporting stories in future editions of Kachee Goliyan as we look forward to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow next year. In the meantime, they have done a good job creating an image of Mark Beaumont and the baton. It is definitely one for his scrapbook, as he continues his journey around the Commonwealth for the BBC. </body>

      <title>French outrage over US spying claims</title>
      <description>France summons the US ambassador over claims in Le Monde newspaper that the US routinely spied on millions of phone calls in France.</description>

      <body>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has summoned the US ambassador over newspaper claims that the US spied on millions of phone calls in France. France has labelled such activity between allies as "unacceptable". Le Monde says the data, based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, suggest the US NSA agency monitored businesses and officials as well as terrorism suspects. The intercepts were apparently triggered by certain key words. The paper says the National Security Agency (NSA) spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France in just 30 days between December 10 last year and January 8, 2013. The agency also apparently captured millions of text messages. It was unclear whether the content of the calls and messages was stored, or just the metadata - the details of who is speaking to whom. And the paper did not say whether the operation, codenamed US-985D, was still in progress. Mr Fabius announced that he had summoned the US ambassador to discuss the claims "immediately". Interior Minister Manuel Valls had earlier said the allegations were "shocking", and added: "If an allied country spies on France, this is totally unacceptable." The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says the outrage is largely for public consumption, because the French government has been accused of running its own snooping operation similar to the US. Le Monde reported in July that the French government stores vast amounts of personal data of its citizens on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the DGSE intelligence service. Connections inside France and between France and other countries were all monitored, Le Monde reported. Emails, text messages, telephone and internet browsing records are stored for years, it said. The latest revelations follow claims in the German media that US agents hacked into the email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Edward Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Volgograd bus bomb blast kills five</title>
      <description>A suspected suicide bomb attack on a bus in Volgograd, southern Russia, has killed five people and injured more than 20, officials say.</description>

      <body>An explosion that killed at least five people on a bus in the southern Russian city of Volgograd was caused by a bomb, Russian officials say. They suspect a female suicide bomber - the partner of an Islamist militant - carried out the attack. The blast, which happened just after 14:00 (10:00 GMT), also injured more than 20 people, some of them seriously. The North Caucasus, to the south, has seen many attacks by Islamist militants in recent years. It is believed there were 40 people on board the bus, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow reports. He says that all buses in Volgograd have been ordered back to their depots to be searched for any sign of explosives. One man whose daughter survived the explosion told Moscow Echo radio: "It was a powerful explosion - a huge blast. There were lots of students on the bus." Earlier reports had suggested the blast might have been caused by an exploding gas canister. Volgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow. Vladimir Markin, of the Investigative Committee - Russia's equivalent of the FBI - told the RIA Novosti news agency: "A criminal case has been opened under articles outlining terrorism, murder and the illegal use of firearms." Other news agencies quoted sources at the committee as saying the suspected suicide bomber was the partner of a militant Islamist. One source said the woman had recently converted to Islam. In recent years, Russia has seen a number of attacks by women suicide bombers, known as black widows, who are often related to Islamist militants. Female suicide bombers struck at two underground railway stations in Moscow in 2010, killing more than 35 people. They were also believed responsible for explosions on two passenger jets at a Moscow airport in 2004 that killed about 90 people. Separatists in Chechnya have fought two wars with Russian forces over the past two decades. But the violence has spread across the North Caucasus in recent years, including to mainly-Muslim Ingushetia and Dagestan. Hundreds of people, including members of the government and security services, have been killed. President Vladimir Putin has stepped up security in the North Caucasus ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which open in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi on 7 February. </body>

      <body>Fire fighters in Australia's New South Wales have worked throughout the day to battle bushfires across the state, amid fears three blazes could merge. New South Wales has been badly hit by bushfires after the hottest September on record. It has declared a state of emergency. Early on Monday, the fire commissioner said three fires near Lithgow could be at risk of joining into one fire front. Officials say conditions will worsen this week, with a peak on Wednesday. NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told a news briefing early on Monday that the State Mine fire was at risk of merging with a fire at Mount Victoria. "Modelling indicates that there's every likelihood under the forecast weather conditions that these two fires, particularly up in the back end of the mountains will merge at some point... there is every likelihood that these two fires will join up," he said. He added that in a "worst-case scenario" the fire could merge with a third fire at Springwood but said: "With the continued success of the fire-fighting effort, let's hope that it doesn't extend all that far eastward." Speaking at the end of the day, he said the fires at Springwood and State Mine were still burning. "Advice back from the Springwood fire area is that the fire... is still very active and is still burning in the valley system," he said. At the State Mine fire, planned back-burning - a controlled burn aimed at managing a fire - had been thwarted "by the forward spread of the main fire front," he said. Remote area teams would be working on Monday night to try to secure the Blackheath community near Mount Victoria, Mr Fitzsimmons said. "It's a very difficult and challenging operation," he said. "They're going down very deep gorges... right down to creek lines." Around 800 personnel from interstate fire departments are expected to arrive on Tuesday to assist in fire-fighting efforts. Dry weather conditions had made firefighting efforts difficult on Monday, Mr Fitzsimmons added. "The challenge is that most of the thunderstorm activity and lightning activity we are seeing is unaccompanied by any moisture." NSW declared a state of emergency on Sunday, allowing emergency services to order mandatory evacuations, and cut gas and power supplies if needed. Caroline Russell from Winmalee, in the Blue Mountains area, told the BBC that people were scared and getting ready to leave. "We're about one or two streets away from the fire. So, it's extremely hot; it's very scary and it's a little bit panicked around here at the moment," she said. "We're packed and ready to go. Everything's ready in the car. We're just waiting on the... response now as to whether we need to evacuate or not." Fire fighting efforts are set to continue this week, with weather conditions expected to be the most challenging this Wednesday, with warm weather and strong winds predicted. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started the State Mine bushfire. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, has also been arrested over the fires, local media say, citing police. One of the fires, at Heatherbrae, led to Newcastle Airport being shut and forced hundreds of people to evacuate, local reports said. With hundreds of houses already destroyed disaster welfare centres have been set up where families can start the planning needed to rebuild their lives, the BBC's Jon Donnison, who is near the community of Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, reports. Most of the fire fighters are volunteers - many look exhausted, and some have even lost their homes, our correspondent adds.

      <title>Japan extends Fukushima clean-up</title>
      <description>Japan says plans to de-contaminate towns and villages close to the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant will be delayed by up to three more years.</description>

      <body>Plans to decontaminate six towns and villages close to Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant have to be delayed by up to three more years, officials say. The clean-up of the exclusion zone around the crippled plant was initially due to be completed by next March. More than 90,000 people remain unable to return home. Fukushima has been hit by a series of toxic water leaks in recent months. The latest contamination was reported on Sunday after unexpectedly heavy rain. Water with high levels of the toxic isotope Strontium-90 overflowed containment barriers around water tanks, operator Tepco said. The tanks are being used to store contaminated cooling water from reactors damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Cooling systems for reactors were knocked out, causing meltdowns at three of them. On Monday Japan's environment ministry acknowledged the decontamination of towns around the plant is proving much more complicated than originally thought. Tens of thousands of workers are engaged in the massive clean-up effort, removing millions of tonnes of topsoil and vegetation. But in the most highly contaminated areas work is yet to begin. The government's latest prediction is that residents will be able to return home by 2017. But the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says many have already decided they will never go back. Ministry officials cited several reasons for the delay, including a lack of space for the waste from the decontamination work. Water is being pumped in to cool the reactors. However, this creates large amounts of contaminated water that must be stored securely. Some of the water has leaked from the tanks, pipes and damaged structures, leading to concerns that contaminated water is mixing with groundwater flowing into the sea. On Sunday, the rainwater run-off - which becomes contaminated when it hits polluted surfaces areas - overflowed concrete barriers surrounding a group of tanks, reports citing the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) say. Tepco says that in one area, readings of Strontium-90 were at 70 times the legal limit for safe disposal. "Our pumps could not keep up with the rainwater. As a result, it flowed over some containment areas," Tepco spokesman, Yoshikazu Nagai, told Reuters news agency. The company was quoted by Kyodo news agency as saying that some of the toxic water had seeped into the ground, but that it was unlikely to have flowed into the sea. Strontium-90 is a radioactive by-product of the fission of uranium and plutonium inside a nuclear reactor. It is easily absorbed by the human body and is thought to be a cause of bone cancer. More rains are expected in Japan, with meteorologists forecasting a typhoon to make landfall this week. </body>

      <title>Roma couple in Greek court over girl</title>
      <description>A couple are due to appear in court in Greece, suspected of abducting a blonde girl known as Maria found living on a Roma settlement.</description>

      <body>A Roma couple are due to appear in court in Greece on charges of abducting a young blonde girl named Maria. The child, who is about four years old, was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece last week. DNA tests showed that the girl is not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for in Athens by a charity, called The Smile of the Child, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal for information. The Roma couple - a woman aged 40 and a 39-year-old man - are due to appear before judges later on Monday to answer charges of abducting a minor and holding false papers. The Roma community where the girl was found has rallied around the couple, saying they looked after her well. The head of the Roma association in Farsala in central Greece says the pair treated her better than their biological children and that she loved them. The brother of the man claiming to be Maria's father repeated the defence that she had been given to them lawfully after her birth, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens. A lawyer representing the Roma couple, Kostas Katsavos, said they were carrying out a search for the girl's mother. He said the couple claim the woman had given Maria to them because she could not look after her own biological daughter. "Our clients' claim is that 'we never abducted this child we just adopted her' in a way that was not legal, that we can confess," said Mr Katsavos. But the couple are suspected by social workers of kidnapping the girl and sending her out to beg, or involving her in a sex ring. Police initially raided the Roma camp to search for drugs and weapons. They noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents, and found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple had registered different numbers of children with different regional family registries. The Greek authorities say the couple were in possession of false papers which suggested the woman had given birth to six children within a 10-month period. When questioned about how they came to have Maria, the couple gave "constantly changing claims", Thessalia Province Police Director Vassilis Halatsis said. Through Interpol, Greece has requested assistance from other European countries. Police decided to appeal internationally as the girl looked as if she might be from northern or eastern Europe. The case has also brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>Russia faulted over Katyn inquiry</title>
      <description>The European Court of Human Rights says Russia has not explained why it kept key files secret over the 1940 Katyn massacre of Polish war prisoners.</description>

      <body>The European Court of Human Rights says Russia has failed to explain why it kept key files secret when it investigated the 1940 Katyn massacre of more than 20,000 Polish war prisoners. Russia failed to comply with a human rights obligation to provide evidence, the Strasbourg judges ruled. Soviet Russia only admitted to the atrocity in 1990 after blaming the Nazis for five decades. But the ruling also said the court had no authority to rule on the inquiry. The massacre in Katyn forest took place before the European Convention on Human Rights was signed. The court said it did not have competence to rule on Russia's handling of the Katyn investigation because too much time had elapsed between the massacre and the entry into force of the Convention. The court's examination came after 15 relatives of the victims claimed that Russia had failed to carry out an adequate investigation. They said Moscow had prevented them from finding out the truth about the killings in western Russia. The Strasbourg judges dismissed the applicants' claim for just satisfaction in the case, known as Janowiec v Russia. But the judges also said it must be assumed that the applicants' relatives had been killed at Katyn, as they had heard nothing since 1940 from the men who disappeared. Moscow started a criminal investigation into the killings the same year, but the inquiry was discontinued in 2004 on the orders of the Russian chief military prosecutor's office. Files about that decision remain classified, and the Polish claimants have not had access to it or any other information about the investigation. The court judgment on Monday - which is final - said states party to the Convention were "obliged to comply with its requests for evidence and found that Russia, in refusing to submit a key procedural decision which remained classified, had failed to comply with that obligation". They added that "the Russian courts had not conducted a substantive analysis of the reasons for maintaining the classified status". No-one has ever been convicted in connection with the massacre, with Russian prosecutors arguing that those responsible are now dead. However, in 2010 Russia's parliament issued a statement saying more work needed to be done in "verifying the lists of victims... and uncovering the circumstances of the tragedy". The parliament also said the killings had been carried out on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's orders. In 2010, Russia also published online six once-secret files on the mass killings. The documents had until then only been available to researchers. Poland has repeatedly demanded that Russia open all its files on Katyn. The killings were carried out by the Soviet secret police (NKVD) in April and May 1940 in the Katyn forest near the city of Smolensk, and also near the village of Mednoye, in the Tver region, and the village of Pyatykhatky in what was then Soviet Ukraine. The victims were members of the Polish elite, arrested after the USSR invaded and annexed eastern Poland in 1939. They were shot on the recommendation of NKVD head Lavrenty Beria, according to one of the published secret files. In a letter to Stalin dated 5 March 1940, Beria says the Polish prisoners of war should be executed and refers to them as "steadfast, incorrigible enemies of Soviet power". "Each of them is just waiting for liberation so as to actively join the struggle against Soviet power," it says. The letter bears Stalin's signature in blue pencil, with the comment: "In favour." In April 2010, Polish President Lech Kaczynski and more than 90 other government officials were killed when their plane crashed as it was trying to land at Smolensk airport to attend an event marking the Katyn massacre. </body>

      <title>Court condemns Spain over Eta case</title>
      <description>The European Court of Human Rights condemns Spain over its continued detention of a convicted Eta militant, Ines Del Rio, and demands her release.</description>

      <body>The European Court of Human Rights has condemned Spain over its continued detention of a convicted militant, and demanded her release. Ines del Rio, of the Basque separatist group Eta, is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for her role in bomb attacks in the 1980s. The court upheld its earlier ruling that del Rio should be eligible for a sentence reduction for good behaviour. Spain says dozens of Eta prisoners could now be eligible for release. Del Rio was arrested in Zaragoza while driving a car packed with explosives intended for an Eta attack on the Costa del Sol. She was sentenced to more than 3,000 years in jail in 1987, most of which was for her role in a car bomb attack on a Guardia Civil police patrol in Madrid in 1986 which left 14 dead and 40 injured. Under the Spanish legal guidelines in place at the time of her conviction, Del Rio's prison term was reduced to the maximum possible sentence - 30 years. Del Rio was due for early release in 2008 due to good behaviour, but her sentence was extended. But Spain changed the rules on remission in 2006 and decided to postpone Del Rio's release until 2017. In rejecting an appeal by the Spanish government, the European Court of Human Rights has upheld its 2012 ruling against Spain which opposed a legal practice known as the "Parot doctrine" - that allowed prison terms to be extended for people convicted of terrorist offences. The Court, based in Strasbourg, ruled that the prolonged detention of Ines Del Rio was a violation of two articles (5 and 7) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which cover the right to no punishment without law, and the right to liberty and security. In it judgment, the court said "it was incumbent on the Spanish authorities to ensure that she [Ines Del Rio] was released at the earliest possible date". It also ordered the Spanish government to pay 30,000 euros (approximately $41,000, or £25,400) in compensation to Ms Del Rio. Although the Strasbourg court's ruling only applied to Ms Del Rio, the Spanish government had said that dozens of other convicted Eta members could be eligible for release if it was upheld. Groups which represent the victims of terrorist attacks have called on the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, not to comply with the ruling. "Compliance will betray victims of terrorism and all Spaniards," said Voices Against Terrorism, in a statement. </body>

      <title>Kenya CCTV 'shows soldiers looting'</title>
      <description>Security camera footage emerges which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's Westgate mall siege, in which some 67 people died.</description>

      <body>Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall. In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. </body>

      <title>Egypt PM denounces church attack</title>
      <description>Egypt's prime minister condemns an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl.</description>

      <body>Egypt's prime minister has condemned an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo on Sunday that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl. Hazem Beblawi said the security forces were searching for those responsible for the "callous and criminal act". He also vowed that it would "not succeed in sowing divisions" between the Christian and Muslim communities. Coptic activists have accused Mr Beblawi's interim government of failing to protect churches from attack. Their community has been targeted by some Islamists who accuse it of backing the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in July. In the latest attack, two masked gunmen riding on motorbikes fired indiscriminately at people emerging from a wedding service at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the capital's Waraa district on Sunday evening. Health ministry and ambulance service officials said four people were killed, including the girl and a woman, and 17 others were wounded. On Monday, mourners gathered at the church, whose walls were marked by bullets. Security personnel were also deployed on the street outside. Father Dawoud, a priest at the Church of the Virgin Mary told the AFP news agency: "What is happening is that all of Egypt is being targeted, not just the Christians. "Enough! People are getting sick and tired of this." In a cabinet statement, Mr Beblawi said police were investigating the attack, which he called a "callous and criminal act". "Such terrible acts will not succeed in dividing Muslims and Christians." The grand imam of al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's highest religious authority, said the attack ran "contrary to both religion and morals". The National Coalition to Support Legitimacy, a Muslim Brotherhood-dominated alliance calling for the reinstatement of Mr Morsi, urged police to bring the perpetrators to justice quickly and stressed the sanctity of places of all places of worship. The Association of Maspero Youth, a Coptic group formed in 2011 after more than 20 Christians were killed by soldiers outside the Maspero state television building, accused security forces of failing to protect churches. "If the Egyptian government does not care about the security and rights of Christians, then we must ask why we are paying taxes and why we are not arming ourselves if the police are not protecting us?'' it said. About 40 Coptic churches were destroyed in a wave of attacks in August after hundreds of people were killed when security forces broke up two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo. Islamist extremists have accused the Coptic Church of having conspired to oust the president. When the head of the armed forces, Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, went on television to announce that the Islamist president had been deposed in the wake of mass opposition protests demanding his resignation, Pope Tawadros II appeared alongside him. Pope Tawadros said that the general's "roadmap" had been devised by honourable people, who had Egypt's best interests at heart. He has since received death threats, while several Christians have been killed. Christian shops, homes and businesses have also been targeted. The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD. Today, Christians make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million. </body>

      <title>India probes toxic alcohol deaths</title>
      <description>Officials in India begin an inquiry after at least 42 people die from drinking toxic alcohol in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</description>

      <body>Officials in India have begun an inquiry after at least 42 people died from drinking toxic alcohol in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Dozens of people are recovering in hospitals and officials say they expect the number of dead to rise further. Police say they have raided several places and arrested 12 people. They say the liquor was spiked with excessive chemicals which made it poisonous. Deaths from contaminated alcohol are a regular occurrence in India. The homemade alcohol - commonly called desi daroo in India - usually costs as little as 10 rupees (20 US cents) and the majority of the consumers are poor people. Chemicals and pesticides are often added to the alcohol to increase the strength or improve the flavour and the tainted liquor can lead to fits, vomiting and death. People in eight villages of Mubarakpur area in Azamgarh district consumed illegal alcohol on Friday after which they fell ill, police said. "At least 42 people have died in hospitals but we expect the toll to be higher since many bodies have been cremated by families without informing the police or the medical authorities," the chief medical officer in Azamgarh, BB Singh, told the BBC. Some of the victims have gone blind after drinking the toxic brew, officials said. Half a dozen policemen and five officials from the state's excise department have been suspended by the state government. India has witnessed many toxic alcohol deaths over recent years. Some 169 people were killed in West Bengal in December 2011, while 107 people died in Gujarat in July 2009. Nearly 200 people died in Orissa in 1992 after consuming a deadly combination of methyl and ethyl alcohol. Gujarat has taken the strongest action on toxic liquor with a law that makes the illegal manufacture and sale of toxic alcohol there punishable by death. It says the law was intended to deter those involved in the illegal trade. Gujarat, Mizoram and Nagaland are the only states in India where alcohol is totally prohibited by law. </body>

      <body>At least seven people have been killed after a bomb hit a passenger train in the Pakistani province of Balochistan, officials say. It is unclear if the bomb was placed on the tracks or on board the train, which was travelling from Rawalpindi to Quetta, the main city in Balochistan. No group has said it carried out the attack on the Jaffar Abad Express. Balochistan sees frequent outbreaks of violence involving both Islamist militants and separatist rebels. Baloch separatist insurgents have long demanded more autonomy and a greater share of Balochistan's natural resources. The blast hit the train as it was travelling through the Notal area in the Nasir Abad District. All traffic on that route was shut down and local reports said the impact of the blast left a large crater at the site. Police said officers were still at the scene investigating the incident and that the injured were taken to the Dera Murad Jamali hospital. </body>

      <title>Troops deployed at Rio oil auction</title>
      <description>Brazilian troops start patrolling the streets of Rio de Janeiro to prevent trouble ahead of a controversial oilfield auction on Monday.</description>

      <body>The Brazilian government has begun deploying troops on the streets of Rio de Janeiro ahead of a major auction for oil exploration rights. Some 1,100 soldiers sealed off the seafront hotel, where the auction of the huge offshore Libra field is due to take place on Monday. President Dilma Rousseff ordered tighter security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Anti-government protesters have also threatened to march on the auction. In scenes similar to country-wide protests in June, petrol and gas bombs were thrown last Tuesday after marches in support of striking teachers. The forthcoming auction of the Libra deepwater oilfield, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, added to the tension. On Thursday, oil workers launched a strike against the sale, disrupting production at more than 40 oil platforms and major refineries. Eleven international oil companies are said to be interested in the oilfield and nine of them have so far reportedly paid the required registration fee. But the auction is not without controversy with some critics saying Brazil should protect the monopoly of exploration of its oil reserves. But the government insists it is not privatising the country's resources. "We're taking over this immense wealth that lies under the sea and on land. It is not available to us if it stays where it is," Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told AFP news agency. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with state-run oil company Petrobras. On Sunday, the government said it had defeated 18 of 23 court actions lodged to prevent the sale from happening, at the Windsor Barra hotel in the Barra da Tijuca area of Rio. Other critics say the rules set by the government for the auction have scared off big players such as British Petroleum and Exxon for allegedly allowing too much state intervention. Thousands of people stated their intention to join demonstrations via social media at protests near the Windsor hotel. But the army says the area will be cordoned off. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. The government expects Libra's production to peak at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. The Libra field has estimated recoverable oil reserves of 8-12 billion barrels, according to the National Petroleum Agency. </body>

      <body>As parliamentary polls get under way in the Czech Republic this week, artist David Cerny has floated a huge purple statue of an extended middle finger down the River Vltava in Prague. The outsized purple hand has been mounted on a barge floating on the river. It is pointed at Prague Castle, the seat of President Milos Zeman. Mr Cerny has shocked and mocked politicians and public figures in the past, says the BBC's Rob Cameron. This latest piece is clearly his message to the leftist President Zeman and the political party recently set up by his supporters, our correspondent says. It is unclear how long the finger will stay there; Cerny himself declined to say too much about the piece, telling reporters the gesture spoke for itself - what mattered, he said, was which way it was pointing. President Zeman, meanwhile, is on an official visit to Ukraine and said he could not comment until he had seen it. The Czech parliament was dissolved in August following weeks of turmoil in Czech politics. Prime Minister Petr Necas's government collapsed in June amid a bribery scandal, and a government of technocrats, formed by President Zeman in July and opposed by the main political parties, resigned in August. </body>

      <title>New Jersey has first gay weddings</title>

      <body>Gay couples in New Jersey have been exchanging vows on the day the US state became the 14th in the nation to recognise same-sex marriages. Last month, a judge ruled that the state must recognise gay nuptials from Monday. Republican Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 White House candidate, attempted to delay that coming into effect, pending an appeal. But his administration's request was denied by the state's Supreme Court. A few minutes before midnight on Sunday, same-sex couples gathered in civic buildings across the state to wed. Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat who was elected last week to the US Senate, conducted some of the ceremonies at city hall. A protester was removed after shouting: "This is unlawful in the eyes of God and Jesus Christ." Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop conducted a joint ceremony for eight couples at the city council chambers. "I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime," said Barbara Milton after she was married to Kay Osborn, in remarks carried by the Associated Press news agency. "To have this moment of equality is overwhelming." Married gay couples in New Jersey can now receive all the state and federal benefits of marriage. But the legal battle is not quite over. The state's Supreme Court is due in January to hear an appeal by Gov Christie's office. Lawmakers in favour of gay marriage are also trying to overturn his veto of a 2012 bill that would have allowed gay weddings. The Republican has said marriage is between a man and a woman, and argued that a popular vote should determine the issue. </body>

      <title>Greenspan fears more debt deadlock</title>
      <description>Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan tells the BBC that the US debt ceiling crisis is far from over, that the eurozone needs political union, and "crony capitalism" is growing.</description>

      <body>Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that a repeat of the crisis that brought the country close to default is "perfectly conceivable". He told the BBC that he had not seen another situation in Washington where "compromise" seemed so far away. Mr Greenspan confessed to sympathies with the aims of the Tea Party, the Republican faction that fought the government during debt ceiling talks. But the former central banker said the movement's tactics were "undemocratic". Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over. The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees "consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going". He said: "The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. "The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be." But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy. "What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would," Mr Greenspan said. "As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected." Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market. He said: "One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010." There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said. He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. "I was very worried about what the impact would be." Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing "crony capitalism" in the US. He said: "Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which… public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours." He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: "I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction." On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative. "One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. "There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. "Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means. "What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is that… unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down," Mr Greenspan said. Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not "think outside of the box" enough. </body>

      <title>Hurricane Raymond nears Mexico coast</title>
      <description>A category three hurricane is slowly approaching the Pacific coast of Mexico, which only last month was badly hit by Tropical Storm Manuel.</description>

      <body>Hurricane Raymond has strengthened off Mexico's Pacific coast, meteorologists in Mexico say. The National Water Commission (Conagua) said Raymond had been upgraded to a category three hurricane. It is feared it could hit the same area of Guerrero state that was devastated by Tropical Storm Manuel last month. With sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph) Raymond is the first category three hurricane to approach Mexico this year, Conagua meteorologists said. Coastal towns and cities from the beach resort in Acapulco to Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan state have been put on alert as heavy rains are expected to lash the area for some 72 hours. Residents have been warned to stay away from rivers and streams as flash floods are likely. Schools in the area have been ordered to remain closed and the authorities in Michoacan said all maritime activity and road travel should be avoided. Mexico is still struggling to recover from two deadly storm which hit the country almost simultaneously last month. Storms Ingrid and Manuel left more than 150 people dead and caused billions of dollars of damage. Officials fear another storm could cause considerable damage as dozens of dams in the region are still over capacity. They warned people living in low-lying areas or along hillsides prone to mudslides to move to safer ground. The storm, which is some 200km south-southeast of the town of Zihuatanejo, is currently drifting northward, according to the US National Hurricane Center. </body>

      <title>Mexico condemns new US spying claim</title>

      <body>Mexico has strongly condemned alleged US spying after a report said that a former president's emails were hacked by the National Security Agency. Data leaked by fugitive US analyst Edward Snowden showed ex-President Felipe Calderon's emails were hacked in 2010, Germany's Der Spiegel reports. Mexico's foreign ministry said such spying was "unacceptable, illegal" and contrary to good relations. It urged President Obama to complete an investigation into the allegations. In an official statement, the Mexican foreign ministry said it would soon re-iterate the importance of such an investigation through diplomatic means. "In a relationship between neighbours and partners, there is no place for the alleged practices," it said. Previous reports had already suggested the NSA had intercepted communications involving current President Enrique Pena Nieto before he took office in 2012 and Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff. Messages involving her aides and state oil company Petrobas were also said to have been compromised. The revelations prompted a sharp response from Brazil, with the suspension of plans for a state visit by Ms Rousseff to Washington next month. The NSA is also alleged to have seen electronic data from other Latin American governments, including Venezuela and Ecuador. At the G20 meeting in Russia last month, Mr Obama promised to investigate the allegations of espionage against Ms Rousseff and her Mexican counterpart. "What I got from President Obama was a commitment to a full investigation... and if they turn out to be true to impose corresponding sanctions," Mr Pena Nieto told the BBC. The allegations were also based on documents leaked by Mr Snowden. A US federal court has since filed espionage charges against the former intelligence contractor and is seeking his extradition. Mr Snowden, however, remains in Russia where he has been granted temporary asylum. </body>

      <body>More than 40 people have been killed and scores wounded in an attack on villages in South Sudan's Jonglei state, an army spokesman has said. The attackers were believed to be members of David Yau Yau's rebel group, the spokesman said. Jonglei is badly affected by ethnic rivalries and disputes over land and cattle ownership. More than 1,500 people are estimated to have been killed in the area since South Sudan's independence in 2011. Tens of thousands have also been left homeless by the fighting. Col Philip Aguer, the army spokesman, told the BBC at least two villages were burnt during the attack on Sunday. The militiamen were armed with machine guns and RPG rocket launchers, he added. Thousands of cattle had also been stolen during the attack, the acting governor of Jonglei, Hussein Maar, said, Associated Press news agency reports. South Sudan is awash with small arms after decades of conflict against Khartoum's rule. Khartoum gave it independence in 2011 following talks brokered by the US and regional countries. Cattle lie at the heart of life for many communities in the country which has hardly any banks - they are used as a form of wealth, to pay dowries and as a source of food in the lean season. A single cow can be worth hundreds of dollars depending on its colouring. </body>

      <body>Three people, including a girl aged eight, died when gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on a wedding party outside a Coptic Christian church in Cairo. At least nine others were wounded in the attack in Giza, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Egypt's Coptic Christian community has been targeted by some Islamists who accuse the Church of backing the army's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in July. The unidentified attackers fired indiscriminately as people left the church. A man and a girl were killed outside the church and a woman died on her way to hospital. "We heard a very loud sound as if something was collapsing," one eyewitness said. "I found a woman seated in a chair with lots of bullet wounds, covered in blood. Many other people had fallen around her, including a child," he added. Coptic priest Thomas Daoud Ibrahim said he was inside the church when the gunfire erupted. "What happened is an insult to Egypt, and it's not only directed against Coptic Christians. We are destroying our own country," he said. Another priest, Beshay Lotfi, told Egyptian media that the church had been left without a police guard since the end of June. The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD. Christians make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million, and have generally coexisted peacefully with majority Sunni Muslims for centuries. However, the overthrow of Mr Morsi by the military has been followed by the worst attacks on churches and Christian properties in years. When head of the armed forces, Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, went on television to announce that the Islamist president had been deposed in the wake of mass opposition protests demanding his resignation, Pope Tawadros II appeared alongside him. Pope Tawadros said that the "roadmap" mentioned by the general had been devised by honourable people, who had Egypt's best interests at heart. He has since received death threats, while several Christians have been killed. Christian shops, homes and businesses have also been targeted. </body>

      <body>Smog has choked China's northern city of Harbin, Heilongjiang province, forcing schools and highways to shut and disrupting flights on Monday. The density of airborne particles was several times above World Health Organisation recommended limits. Visibility was reduced to below 50m (160ft) in parts of the city, reports said. Local media have linked the pollution to the city switching on its public heating system for winter. PM2.5 levels, used to measure the amount of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres in the air, were above 500 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday morning, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. World Health Organization guidelines say average daily concentrations of PM2.5 should be no more than 25 microgrammes per cubic metre. All of Heilongjiang province's highways, and the Taiping International Airport in Harbin were forced to close, Xinhua reported. A red alert for thick smog had been issued in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, the news agency added. Earlier this year, air pollution in China's capital, Beijing, also soared past hazardous levels. The smog generated extensive discussion on Sina Weibo, one of China's Twitter-like microblogs. "We were all late for class today because we couldn't find the academic building," microblog user MaltzZz from Jilin province wrote. Harbin-based Sina Weibo user Backpacker Xiao described Harbin as "today's dead city". "Beijing, you're no longer alone. You have us too now," he wrote, in reference to the frequent air pollution suffered by Beijing. Meanwhile, netizen Pen and Ink Silent, a student in Changchun, Jilin, posted the following tongue-in-cheek message: "My mother called... and asked how the air in Changchun was, and if I was coughing.

      <body>The chief engineer of a US-owned ship detained in India has attempted to take his own life while in jail, police say. The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October and its crew, which includes Indians, Britons, Ukrainians and Estonians, was arrested on Friday. Police said others present in the cell prevented the engineer from taking his life. His nationality is not known. Indian authorities say the vessel entered Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons on board. AdvanFort, the US-company which owns the Sierra-Leone-registered vessel, said it was involved in supporting anti-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean. The ship is currently anchored at Tuticorin port in southern Tamil Nadu state. Police told the BBC's Tamil service that the man tried to strangle himself using his shirt at 05:00 local time on Monday [23:30GMT Sunday], but he was stopped in time by others in the cell at Palayamkottai. Reports suggest he may have attempted to take his own life earlier in the weekend as well. Of the 35 crew members, 33 were arrested on Friday, while the remaining two men were taken into custody on Saturday. There have been differing accounts of the chain of events from the Indian authorities and the ship's owner AdvanFort, a US-based security firm. The Indian authorities say they intercepted the American ship when it was reportedly sailing off the coast of Tamil Nadu. Police also said they found weapons and ammunition on board, which had not been properly declared. But in a statement released last week, AdvanFort said India's coast guard and police allowed the vessel to enter the port to refuel and shelter from a cyclone which had hit India's eastern coast. The company even thanked officials. It added that all weaponry and equipment on board was properly registered. In recent years piracy has emerged as a major threat to merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, with ships and their crews sometimes hijacked for ransom. There have been fewer attacks recently, partly because more armed guards are now deployed on board. Six of the crew members are Britons and British high commission officials were allowed into the prison on Monday morning to meet them. </body>

      <body>Notorious serial killer Emile Louis has died in France at the age of 79, his lawyer says. Alain Fraitag says the former bus driver died in a secure hospital in Nancy in the early hours of Sunday. Louis was jailed for life in 2004 for the murders of seven young women in the 1970s. Many of the victims were mentally disabled and in care in the northern Yonne region. Some had used a bus driven by Louis. He admitted carrying out some of the murders in 2000, but later retracted the confession. The case against Louis was plagued with a succession of judicial problems. In March 2002, the government punished three magistrates for failing in their duties by allowing Louis to avoid prosecution for more than 20 years. The thoroughness of the investigation was also questioned. Many of the victims had severe learning difficulties, yet the local authorities simply recorded them as runaways. French police appeared to show little interest at the time. Only one local gendarme pursued evidence against Louis, but the inquiries were halted and a damning report was lost until 1996. The gendarme was then found shot dead - in what was recorded as suicide. It was only thanks to pressure from the victims' families that the issue was kept alive until Louis was convicted and jailed. </body>

SPD leaders promised the 200 members meeting on Sunday that they would win concessions, including a minimum wage, from Mrs Merkel's centre-right bloc. Mrs Merkel's alliance won recent elections but fell short of a majority. In 2005-2009 the SPD formed a "grand" coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the allied CSU. But correspondents say the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again. A majority of the 200 members meeting on Sunday backed a statement agreeing to the start of formal talks. An internal SPD document seen by Reuters before the meeting said the party would insist that 10 demands were non-negotiable. They include a minimum wage of 8.50 euros (£7) per hour, equal pay for men and women, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a common strategy to boost eurozone growth and employment. The party would also demand equal pensions for the elderly in the former West and East Germany and measures to make it easier to combine work with family life, Reuters reported. No mention was made of tax increases for the wealthiest, which the SPD had campaigned on during September's election. Allies of Chancellor Merkel have said they could live with a minimum wage but not with the higher taxes. The SPD also wants to move away from tough austerity measures and focus more on growth and job creation. It is understood that talks on coalition policies and cabinet posts could begin as early as next Wednesday and could last more than a month. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says a grand coalition is likely, and with it a slight move of the German government to the left, with more government spending and a more generous attitude towards eurozone countries in trouble. But it would not be a major shift - Chancellor Merkel would remain very much in charge, our correspondent says. He adds that it will be interesting to see if the SPD pushes for the post of finance minister in any new government, as the post is currently filled by the CDU's Wolfgang Schaeuble, seen as the driver of Germany's tough economic policy. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition allies, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats in September, leaving her seeking a new partner. Her options narrowed last week when the Greens announced that talks with the CDU/CSU had failed. At the polls on 22 September, the CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. </body>

      <title>Riyadh 'ratcheting up repression'</title>
      <description>Amnesty International says Saudi Arabia has failed to act on recommendations by a UN body to improve its human rights and "ratcheted up" repression.</description>

      <body>Saudi Arabia has failed to act on recommendations by a UN body to improve human rights and instead "ratcheted up" repression, Amnesty International says. Promises the Gulf Kingdom made to the UN Human Rights Council in 2009 were "nothing but hot air", a report claims. The authorities continue to crack down on activists through "arbitrary arrests and detention, unfair trials, torture and other ill-treatment", it adds. The Human Rights Council will review Saudi Arabia in Geneva on Monday. On Friday, Riyadh refused to take up a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, accusing the body of failing in its duties towards Syria, as well as in other conflicts. In its report published on Monday, Amnesty said the kingdom had failed to implement any of the main recommendations from its last Universal Periodic Review by the Human Rights Council. "Four years ago, Saudi Arabian diplomats came to Geneva and accepted a string of recommendations to improve human rights in the country. Since then, not only have the authorities failed to act, but they have ratcheted up the repression," said Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director. "For all the peaceful activists that have been arbitrary detained, tortured or imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since, the international community has a duty to hold the authorities to account." Amnesty's report documents what it describes as a "new wave of repression against civil society" that has taken place since 2011. Human rights activists and supporters of political reform in the country face repressive measures that included arbitrary arrest, detention without charge or trial, unfair trials and travel bans, it says. In March, two founders of the prominent Saudi Civil and Political Rights Organisation (ACPRA), Abdullah al-Hamid and Mohammed al-Qahtani, were sentenced to 10 and 11 years respectively. The men, who used Twitter to promote human rights, were found guilty by a court of "breaking allegiance and disobeying the ruler", "undermining unity", "questioning the integrity of officials", "seeking to disrupt security" and "inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations". "These men are prisoners of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally. Their peaceful activism against human rights violations deserves praise not punishment. The only guilty party here is the government," Mr Luther said. Torture and other ill-treatment during detention is rife and carried out with impunity, the report says. The heavy reliance by the courts on "confessions" often extracted under torture, duress or deception has entrenched such abuses, it claims. It documents other alleged violations, including "systemic discrimination of women in both law and practice" and "abuse of migrant workers". The report also accuses the Sunni-ruled kingdom of "discrimination against minority groups", including Shia in Eastern Province, where many have been arrested for taking part in protests to demand greater rights and several have been killed in clashes with security forces. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 glitch hits RT owners</title>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become un-useable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <title>JP Morgan 'faces record $13bn fine'</title>
      <description>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports say.</description>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <body>Japan has posted a trade deficit for the 15th month in a row in September as a weak yen pushed up import costs. The deficit for the month rose to 932bn yen ($9.5bn; £5.8bn), up 64% from a year ago, as imports rose 16.5%. A series of aggressive measures aimed at reviving Japan's economy has resulted in the yen falling nearly 25% against the US dollar since November. While that has helped Japan's exports by making them cheaper, it has also made imports more expensive. However, the growth in exports has not been sufficient enough to offset the higher import bill. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that exports rose 11.5% in September, from a year earlier. Japan's imports have grown at a faster rate than its exports in all but one of the past 11 months. Analysts said that imports have been rising over these months partly due to higher demand for fuel, which has been triggered by the shutdown of all of Japan's nuclear reactors. At the same time, a recovery in Japan's economy is also helping spur domestic demand. Last month, revised data showed that Japan's economy expanded 0.9% in the April-to-June period, from the previous three months. That translates into an annualised growth of 3.8%. Martin Schulz, of Fujitsu Research Institute, said that given these factors "Japan was likely to see a trade deficit for some time to come". "And as long as it is being driven by a recovery in domestic demand, this is not necessarily a negative sign for the overall economy," he added. </body>

      <description>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United can still win the Premier League despite their poor start.</description>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United are still involved in the Premier League title race. The Gunners are top of the table, eight points clear of the reigning champions, who have endured their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the standings. "Are Man United out of the title race? No, but of course 10 points starts to be a little gap," said Wenger. "They have big players, big experience and they are a big club." A late goal from Southampton's Adam Lallana denied United victory at Old Trafford on Saturday, with the south-coast club sitting sixth and holding a four-point advantage over David Moyes's side. In contrast, Arsenal's resounding 4-1 win over Norwich at the Emirates maintained their two-point advantage at the top of the league and extended their unbeaten run since their opening day defeat to Aston Villa. "If you have the choice, you want to be in the race at the top, but you cannot rule Man United out today," added Wenger. "It is too early." The Frenchman, whose side overturned United's 12-point lead to win the title in 1998, added that eight points can be retrieved quickly. "It is three games," said Wenger. "That is very quick in our league." Scrutiny of United's form has been intense since Moyes became manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since a 4-1 opening day win at Swansea, his side have only beaten the league's bottom two sides and have suffered defeats by Liverpool, Manchester City and West Brom. The run leaves them seven points worse off than at the same stage last season, when they eventually won the title by 11 points. BBC pundit Alan Hansen says the poor run of form is in danger of ending their hopes this term. "In terms of the title, they are certainly on the verge of losing it as a consequence of their unconvincing start to the season," Hansen wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.  "United were truly awful at times in the early weeks and months of last season, but the difference between then and now was that they dragged themselves to victories with the late surges that are missing now. "Maybe that is down to the 'Fergie factor', but it is more likely down to the inevitability that, sooner or later, the tide begins to turn." Former Everton manager Moyes has already admitted filling the void left by Ferguson after his 27 years and 38 trophies at Old Trafford will be difficult. Ex-United striker Dion Dublin, speaking to MOTD2 Extra, believes Ferguson is missed. "As a player who played at Old Trafford for Coventry and Villa, you sometimes lose the game before you get off the coach because you're in such awe of the stadium and players you are going to play against - and managers can be the same," said Dublin. "Ferguson's not there anymore, so players are thinking 'hold on, we've got a chance here'." </body>

      <body>Tim Cahill scored the fastest goal in Major League Soccer history with his effort after eight seconds for New York Red Bulls on Sunday. Ex-Everton midfielder Cahill, 33, volleyed in from outside the area in a 3-0 win over Houston Dynamo to beat the previous record of 11 seconds set by Dwayne de Rosario in 2003. "It was a special goal and something I won't forget," said Cahill. The Red Bulls top the Eastern Conference with one game to play. Australian Cahill left Everton midway through last year's MLS season and plays alongside former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry. Now in his first full season, he is the club's top scorer with 11 goals. A run of seven games without defeat has helped the Red Bulls reach top spot in the Eastern Conference. They needed to finish in the top five to qualify for the MLS Cup, a knockout tournament that also includes the best five teams from the Western Conference. Former England midfielder David Beckham was part of the Los Angeles Galaxy team which won the MLS Cup in 2012. </body>

      <body>US comedian Carol Burnett has been honoured with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Dame Julie Andrews, Tony Bennett and Tina Fey were among those who performed in her honour at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Sunday. Burnett's variety show began in the 1960s and ran for 11 years, averaging 30 million viewers a week. "This is very encouraging... it was a long time in coming," Burnett joked as she accepted the prize. She added: "I understand because there are so many people funnier than I am, especially here in Washington. "With any luck, they'll soon get voted out, and I'll still have the Mark Twain Prize." Fey - creator and star of 30 Rock - applauded Burnett, 80, for opening doors for other female comedians. When Burnett first launched her own show, a TV executive told her the genre was "a man's game". "You mean so much to me," Fey said. "I love you in a way that is just shy of creepy," she joked. Burnett got her first break when she was talent-spotted by bookers for the Ed Sullivan Show. She then landed a role on Broadway and began to appear on The Garry Moore Show. This led to Burnett signing a 10-year contract with CBS to do guest slots on sitcoms and perform in one TV special a year. She launched the Carol Burnett Show in 1967, with guest stars including Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan. It won 22 Emmy awards. Burnett was best known for her "Tarzan" yell and for ending each show by tugging her ear, which was a personal message to her grandmother. Tim Conway, one of Burnett's co-stars on her show, joked that he now spends his time travelling around the US for Burnett to receive awards. "Thank you for being such a friend, such a generous person, not with salary, but generous." </body>

      <title>Gravity holds firm at US box office</title>
      <description>Sandra Bullock space adventure Gravity leads the US box office for a third week, as Wikileaks film The Fifth Estate flops in its opening weekend.</description>

      <body>Sandra Bullock's space thriller Gravity has held on to the top of the US and Canadian box office for a third week. The 3D thriller, co-starring George Clooney, took $31 million (£19m) according to figures from Rentrak. Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, stayed in second place, taking $17.3 million (£10.6m) in its second week. WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, had 2013's worst debut weekend so far, taking just $1.7m. (£1m) Assange, who founded whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, had claimed Disney's film would be a failure. Last week, an email he wrote to Cumberbatch urging him not to take part in the project was released online. Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuaron and starring Bullock and Clooney as astronauts stranded in space, has now made more than $170m (£105m) in three weeks. IMAX screenings have proved particularly popular because of the film's groundbreaking visuals, accounting for $38m (£23m) in ticket sales, with 82% of audiences opting for 3D showings. Warner Brothers' Jeffrey Goldstein has attributed the film's success to "phenomenal word of mouth". Paul Greengrass's true story-based Somali pirate drama Captain Philips also held off newcomer Carrie. The horror remake, starring Kick-Ass actress Chloe Grace Moretz, took third place, with $17m (£10m). The original 1976 film, based on Stephen King's novel, saw Oscar nominations for actresses Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Family favourite, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, was in fourth after taking $10.1m (£6.2m) in its fourth week. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's new action film Escape Plan rounded off the top five with $9.8m (£6m). In a limited release of just 19 cinemas, Steve McQueen's Oscar-tipped slavery epic 12 Years a Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, opened with a promising $960,000 (£594,000). </body>

      <description>Rock legend David Bowie fails to win any prizes at the Q Awards, despite nominations in six categories.</description>

      <body>Rock legend David Bowie has been left empty-handed at this year's Q Awards, despite receiving six nominations. He was trounced by Ellie Goulding in the prize for best solo artist, while Vampire Weekend beat him to the award for "best act in the world today". The 66-year-old's comeback record, The Next Day - given five stars by Q Magazine in April - lost out to Biffy Clyro in the best album category. The awards are chosen by readers of the monthly music magazine and its website. Biffy Clyro's Simon Neill said: "Thank you so so much. I think I speak on every award winner's behalf when I say thank goodness David Bowie didn't turn up." Glastonbury won best event of 2013, beating Bowie's exhibition at the VandA Museum, and Kraftwerk's series of 3D live shows at Tate Modern. Best single went to Arctic Monkeys, for Do I Wanna Know?; while The Manic Street Preachers took home best video, for Show Me The Wonder. Comic Al Murray quipped as the Manics left the stage: "The Manic Street Preachers. Apart from Doctor Who, the only industry left in Wales." Starring Submarine actor Craig Roberts, the miniature love story was filmed in the Pioneer Working Men's Club in Porth, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales. Teenage singer-songwriter Jake Bugg was named best new act, while cerebral Oxford rockers Foals won the best live band trophy. Yannis Philippakis, lead singer from the band, said: "It shows you don't need a backing track, you don't need affectation, you don't need Elvis Presley impersonations." Bowie, who did not attend the award ceremony, was expected to win several prizes following his surprise comeback in January after a 10-year hiatus. Q Magazine had showered his album with praise, calling it "a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that... sound like they desperately need to be sung". However, he was not the only artist to walk away empty-handed. Daft Punk, the French dance duo whose inescapable single Get Lucky has contributed to the best year for British single sales in history, also failed to win any of the three categories in which they were nominated. The annual ceremony also distributes a number of lifetime achievement awards, decided by "Q's resident musical experts". This year's recipients included Chrissie Hynde (classic songwriter), Robbie Williams (Q Idol) and reinvigorated rock band Suede (Q Icon). Williams joked as he collected his award: "Sorry I couldn't be here in person to receive this. Of all the made-up awards to get a celebrity to an awards show, this is definitely one of them." The Pet Shop Boys were also given the Outstanding Contribution to Music award. "We keep being told that these are tough times for the industry, but the evidence here suggests the opposite," said Q's senior editor Matt Mason. "We're particularly delighted to salute evergreen artists such as Robbie, the Pet Shop Boys and Suede, who've all made excellent new music over the last 12 months. "They're brilliant reminders of the enduring power of the great British pop act." </body>

      <description>How the BBC's first man in Moscow got sent into the cold</description>

      <body>The BBC tried to open a bureau in Russia during World War II but only succeeded some 20 years later - in 1963. In the last half century, much has changed for the BBC's Man in Moscow. It was the summer of 1942 and Winston Churchill had flown to Russia to cement his wartime alliance with Joseph Stalin. "We will continue hand in hand like comrades and brothers," Churchill declared on arrival, "until every vestige of the Nazi regime has been beaten into the ground." Talk like this gave BBC bosses an idea. If Blighty and the Bolsheviks were suddenly best buddies, perhaps now was the moment to have a BBC correspondent based full-time in Moscow? So they sounded out the Soviets. And the answer came back: "Nyet!" A memo from the Assistant Controller of News written at the time reads: "The DG and editor-in-chief went to see the Soviet ambassador the other day and got no change at all. The Ambassador was extremely chilly. DG was left with the impression that nothing is likely to come of it." Mind you, it wasn't only Stalin who poured cold water on the idea. "I think all Moscow cover is a waste of time and money," argued the BBC Central European Correspondent. It was his job to report on Russia from the safety, and coffee-shop comfort of Vienna. In 1961 he tried to knock the whole idea on the head in a memo to his editor: "It is impossible in the USSR to get either official or unofficial reaction to anything except through the pages of the press the next day. Though this is often forgotten in London where it is naturally assumed correspondents will be able to go and talk to the renowned man-in-the-street. They can't. The opportunities for being a journalist are very slight indeed and to an experienced man this is very annoying." But when Soviet censorship eased under Nikita Khrushchev, the temptation to establish a permanent presence behind the iron curtain became irresistible and in 1963 the BBC finally opened a Moscow bureau. Erik de Mauny was the obvious choice for the BBC's first resident correspondent in the USSR. Not only did he have plenty of foreign reporting experience (previous postings included Vienna, Beirut and Washington), he also had a university degree in Russian. The BBC bought him a car, a dark green Humber Super Snipe, which had been specially adapted to cope with the cold. And to keep himself warm, the intrepid reporter had brought with him two key items - an ankle-length suede coat from Moss Bros and a pair of RAF flying boots. De Mauny wrote about his Moscow experiences in a book, Shouting Through the Static. Sadly, he died before it could be published. The manuscript reads like the screenplay for a James Bond film. Particularly the account of a scoop with a spook - his exclusive interview in 1964 with the spy, Kim Philby. The two men spent six hours in Philby's hotel suite getting drunk on vodka, wine and Armenian cognac, while Philby's KGB minder waited patiently in the corridor. Then de Mauny had a tough decision to make. I woke at 09:00 next morning with throbbing temples and with a realisation that I was in a dilemma. Should I send a news despatch to London about my meeting with Kim? What was more, should I mention it to any of my close colleagues? I knew I had a scoop, if I chose to play it that way, because apart from one brief sighting by a Reuters' correspondent some months earlier, no-one had tracked Kim down, still less talked to him at length as I had done. Nevertheless, I decided to wait. A news despatch would certainly make an impact, but it was highly likely to prove a nine-days wonder. I seemed to me sensible to keep my powder dry and wait to see whether my encounter with Kim might yield long-term benefits. After careful thought, however, I decided that the Embassy ought to be informed. So a bit later that morning, my hangover having subsided, I drove down to the big pseudo-Gothic mansion on the river embankment opposite the Kremlin. I found the Minister, Tom Brimelow, in his office and while we made small talk I slipped him a piece of paper on which I'd written: "I saw Kim Philby last night. Thought you might like to know about it." Tom contemplated this without emotion, but a few moments later he said, "That reminds me - I must have a word with the ambassador. I shan't be long." He was back a moment or two later with the ambassador, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, who gave me a brief nod. Then, with Tom leading, we made our way in silence down to the Embassy "safe room", a small basement room enclosed in an electronic shield in which one could talk without fear of being bugged... A day or so later, as I was crossing the courtyard (at home), I was intercepted by one of the first secretaries from the embassy, who handed me a folded piece of paper. "From the ambassador," he said, adding in a low voice, "better put it down the loo when you've read it." I opened the paper and saw that it contained a single typewritten sentence: "London advises break off contact." In my role as Moscow correspondent I have never had to scribble secret notes to embassy officials or participate in drinking sessions with secret agents. And yet, 50 years on, Moscow correspondents are still chasing spy stories. After all, espionage didn't end when the Cold War did. Like most foreign journalists in Moscow at the time, De Mauny assumed that his apartment was bugged. As frustrating as that may have been for his family, this created comical situations. During a visit to Moscow by the BBC's director general, Hugh Greene, and the head of BBC foreign liaison, Donald Stephenson, the correspondent invited his bosses - and British ambassador Sir Humphrey Trevelyan - back to his flat for a drink. Suddenly, Donald caught my eye. "I say, old boy, there's one thing I've been meaning to ask," he said. "Is it true that Mrs Furtseva is Khrushchev's mistress?" Before I could utter a word, Sir Humphrey had cut in. "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture," he said firmly. "Yes, I know," said Donald, not to be put off, "but is she Khrushchev's mistress?" The ambassador directed his gaze at the ceiling, and, this time in loud, decisive tones, once more declared: "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture!" I saw Donald open his mouth, as if to make a further try. Then, fortunately, the penny dropped. There was a moment of embarrassed silence, and we turned to other topics. It was from the Central Telegraph Office on Gorky Street that Erik de Mauny filed many of his stories. This sprawling construction was the communications hub of the Soviet Union - people came here to send telegrams, telexes, letters and to make long-distance calls. De Mauny would often book telephone lines to London hours in advance. At the allotted time he would turn up, go into a booth and voice his despatch. At least, that was the theory. But sometimes the lines never came up. This happened so often that de Mauny even wrote to the Soviet communications minister to complain. Since then, of course, technology has moved on. Today the Moscow correspondent can use his smart phone to broadcast live radio in quality, even to transmit TV pictures. As for the Central Telegraph, you can still send telegrams from there. But all those old Soviet telephone booths have been ripped out and replaced by a bank and a cafe. I checked out the cafe. The food is adequate, but not as exotic as some of the delicacies de Mauny was treated to in the 1960s. All foreign correspondents and the entire diplomatic corp based in Moscow would get invited to lavish banquets at the Kremlin. De Mauny interpreted it as an attempt by Khrushchev to impress the outside world: The chosen guests and members of the politburo were grouped behind the top table, while the rest of us circulated between the two long side tables. All three tables were lavishly laden with the most succulent dishes imaginable, from mounds of the finest Iranian caviar from the southern Caspian - plump globules of grey imperial malosol in crystal dishes surrounded by crushed ice - to great platters of smoked salmon and sturgeon... Meanwhile, waiters hurried among the guests with trays of delicious hot snacks, ice-cream and champagne, coffee and Armenian cognac. The Moscow correspondent today has fewer opportunities to dine in such decadence at the heart of Russian power. But, on the positive side, he has far more options for eating out than de Mauny ever did - today Moscow is awash with cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The supermarkets are better stocked, too, and many of them are open round the clock. The Soviet concept of "defitsit" or "shortage" has, thankfully, passed into history. Erik de Mauny spent three years in Moscow. During that time he covered such momentous events as the first woman cosmonaut in space and Nikita Khrushchev's fall from power. In 1966 he left Moscow and moved to the BBC's Paris bureau. But six years later he was back in the USSR for a second stint. In 1974 he reported the arrest of the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Only hours before, de Mauny had recorded Solzhenitsyn reading from his book, Gulag Archipelago. Now he needed to get that tape to London, fast. And it was de Mauny's wife Elizabeth, a fellow journalist, who came up with an ingenious solution. In a souvenir shop she bought a cassette recording of the Red Army choir. She took out the tape and put the Solzhenitsyn recording in its place. Then a family friend who was returning to London smuggled it out. Collectively they had beaten the system - with a little help from the Soviet military's finest voices. Having read de Mauny's memoirs, I'm struck both by what has changed in Russia over the last 50 years and by what hasn't. As a foreign correspondent based in Moscow, Erik de Mauny wasn't allowed to travel more than a few miles out of the Soviet capital without permission from the Soviet authorities. I have much more freedom to move around, although even today some parts of the country are still off-limits to me. And yet today, just like in 1963, dealing with officialdom can be problematic. I sense that many officials continue to view Western journalists with deep suspicion. De Mauny wrote that there were "so many contradictions between the warmth and generosity of individual friends and the sheer heartlessness of the system". That rings true now today. Russians who don't fit in with "the system" or who openly criticise it run the risk of being identified as troublemakers, even enemies of Russia. But there is one story in Russia today which I'm certain Erik de Mauny would have gained great pleasure and pride from telling. And it's 700 miles east of Moscow. I fly to the city of Perm in the Ural Mountains and attend a rehearsal at the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre. This is one of the oldest and most successful musical theatres in Russia. And the general manager and executive producer here is Marc de Mauny, the son of the BBC's first Moscow correspondent. Marc was just three when his father's second posting to Moscow ended in 1974. But, years later, he would return to study music at the St Petersburg Conservatory. He became fascinated by Russia, just like his father. "My father loved Russian culture, literature and music, and I think, unwittingly, he passed that on to me," Marc says. "I didn't wake up to that until I was 16 or 17 and wondering where to go for my gap year and what to study at university. And it came to me in a blinding flash that I'd like to study Russian and travel in Russia and discover this country which I'd heard so much about from my father. But I had grown up with Russia and the Soviet Union very much present as this vast, mysterious land. It was an emotional involvement. Russia is an emotional place." In a tiny practice room, spellbound, I watch a soloist putting heart and soul into a piece from Madame Butterfly. And I have to agree - Russia is an emotional place. This is a country of big hearts, great talents. But also huge problems and deep disappointments. Russia is beauty and beast. For the Moscow correspondent the challenge was, and always will be, to paint a complete picture. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>One woman's mission to save Nigeria's palms</title>
      <description>One woman's mission to save Nigeria's ecological riches</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24443919</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70604000/jpg/_70604191_bottlepalm.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>One of Nigeria's former first ladies, Ajoke Muhammed, now devotes her time to saving indigenous plants, including the West African nation's many species of palm tree. She has the largest private collection of plants in Nigeria, with more than 2,000 trees and shrubs, and 400 types of palm growing in her garden, built up over eight years in the capital, Abuja. The 72-year-old imports many of Nigeria's endangered plants as seeds - her aim is to conserve, propagate and disseminate forgotten indigenous plants. She often stops her car and disembarks to conduct a search whenever she drives past an area with dense foliage; she also organises plant expeditions to remote villages around Nigeria. "There are plants everywhere but palms have a special aura," she says. "They have the ability to transform an environment in a way that no other plant can." For some people in temperate parts of the world, the palm tree symbolises a tropical, relaxing holiday, but for those who live in places where they grow, such as Nigeria, they are a vital economic resource. Products as diverse as oil, sponges, brooms, wine and raffia are all made from the trees. Palm products also form the raw material for other essential items, such as soap, salt, food and medicine. However, Nigeria's reliance on crude oil means the palm has long been neglected, and many local species are in danger of becoming extinct. There are currently more than 2,000 species of palm around the world but, nowadays, only about three to five are common in Nigeria. "Half of the world's palms originate in Madagascar, but Africans are not interested," Mrs Muhammed says. "It's the Westerners who go there in search of plants that are going into extinction, which they then take back to their own countries." Nigeria was the world's leading producer of palm oil during the period of British rule, while West Africa was the centre of the palm industry. In the 1870s, colonial administrators took palm seedlings from West Africa to Malaysia. Today, Malaysia is the global leader in oil palm plantations, production and export of palm oil products. Its output, combined with that of Indonesia, far exceeds the quantity of palm oil produced by the entire continent of Africa. Mrs Muhammed's struggle to conserve Nigeria's plants was illustrated during an expedition to a village in the Cross River state several years ago. She was shocked when she came across some davidia involucrate plants, which grow into what is commonly known as the handkerchief tree because of its attractive white flowers. They were growing wild by the river even though the plant is not thought to be native to Nigeria. "Some of its seeds are bronzy, pink, brown, red... lovely," Mrs Muhammed said. "But it's a very difficult plant to grow." Excited at this find, Mrs Muhammed and her team, comprising staff of some Nigerian agriculture agencies, decided to apply a plant propagation technique known as air layering - which encourages a stem on the parent plant to grow its own roots, allowing it to be removed and planted within a few weeks. Some members of the expedition had carried along personal items in black polythene bags; they tore pieces from these to use as moisture barriers on the targeted stem. The group had also brought along a photographer, who captured the entire procedure on film. Six weeks later, Mrs Muhammed sent the photographer back to record the progress of the newly rooted plants, but he found they had all been felled by villagers. Seeing new plants rooting on the stems alongside the patches of black plastic, in terror they had convened a meeting with their village head during which it was concluded that the plants were bewitched. Mrs Muhammed says many plants that are considered indigenous to other parts of the world can be found thriving in remote Nigerian forests, where no foreigner could ever have planted them. She bemoans Africans' general lack of interest in such matters, which leads to other regions laying claim to native species. But Nigerians can learn more about their flora and fauna at the first site set up by Mrs Muhammed in the 1990s just outside Lagos city, the 30-hectre (74-acre) Murtala Muhammed Memorial Botanical Garden. It was named after her late husband, a popular former military head of state who was assassinated in 1976; she also has a one-hectare garden in the Lekki area of Lagos. However, neither of these gardens is as fully stocked or dedicatedly tended as her Abuja garden, with its botanical and palm collection, known as a palmetum. As I accompanied Mrs Muhammed on a tour of her 20-hectare Sarius Palmetum and Botanic Garden, she pointed out some endangered plants: "Our government thinks agriculture is only about corn and cassava," says Mrs Muhammed. "But there is a lot of commercial potential in these other plants." She adds that most people who visit her gardens are more interested in purchasing plants purely for their aesthetic value. And so, in an effort to get people to cultivate them, she ends up giving out the less attractive endangered plants free of charge. She also encourages groups of pupils who come on excursions to her garden to plant a palm to which they can affix the name of their school. Mrs Muhammed describes her dedication to plants as a "hobby that turned into an occupation". She originally trained as a dental therapist. Her husband bred fish, aquatic snakes and birds, but she discovered her own love of nature after he died, when she moved into a new house that had a garden. Over the past five years, she has paid regular visits to Hawaii and Tahiti, to learn how these beautiful islands have managed to preserve their distinct flaura and fauna. She also volunteers at the Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden in Florida, and attends international botanical conferences. "I'm usually the only black African in attendance at some of these conferences," she says. "I find it a bit embarrassing. For years, I've been trying to form the palm society of Nigeria but no-one is interested." In addition to its vast collection of plants, the Sarius Palmetum hosts an art gallery, a plant nursery and six garden shops. One of the greatest challenges Mrs Muhammed's project has faced is finding good hands. Most of the botany degree holders in her employ arrived with a wealth of theory but almost no practical knowledge, so all her staff had to be trained from scratch. But she has resisted the advice of those who believe she is better off employing expatriates like many other agriculture organisations in Nigeria do. "I would rather manage with Nigerians. In the long run, we will gain from it," she says. Her future plans include a section for the visually impaired, called the garden of the senses, with plants that have special textures and strong smells. She is also working on a pictorial book about Nigeria's plants, to pass on her knowledge to a new generation in the hope they will be inspired to continue her work. </body>

      <title>Jerusalem: Communities up-close</title>
      <description>The Holy City through the eyes of its citizens</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24567567</url>
      <date>1382315866</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70560000/jpg/_70560067_1382094566_tmp_jerusalem_promo.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Jerusalemites are preparing to cast their vote - or abstain in protest - in municipal elections. The city is home to the world's major religions and a host of social, political and economic issues. Here, the BBC's Erica Chernofsky looks at some of Jerusalem's diverse communities and the matters which concern them. Oh, Jerusalem. The holy city, the city of gold, the city of peace. One of the oldest cities in the world, it has been conquered and reconquered, rebuilt and destroyed, for centuries. Every stone has a story, every olive tree a history, and every mountain a different name, depending on who you ask. The city today is a vibrant mosaic of both ancient and modern. From the Old City walls overlooking dusty souks to the state-of-the-art light rail rushing past the upscale shops and five-star hotels of the Mamilla promenade, Jerusalem's ethnic landscape reflects the diversity of its population, a growing melting pot of Israeli society. Despite its charm, Jerusalem is also a source of bitter disputes. It is a divided city, part Arab, part Jewish, and its ownership is still fought over, as ever. Both Israel and the Palestinians claim it as the capital of their nations. Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later annexed it, but the international community does not recognise this sovereignty. According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem is Israel's largest city, but also one of the poorest, with higher unemployment rates than the national average. There are a lot of issues that come with living in Jerusalem, and many of its residents feel the voices of their communities are not being heard. Masada Porat is the first ultra-Orthodox, or haredi, woman to run for the local city council. The ultra-Orthodox community constitutes about a third of Jerusalem's Jewish population, and as such wields plenty of power over local life. There was another haredi woman in the running, but she eventually backed out after reportedly receiving threats against her and her family from within her own community. Ultra-Orthodox society is very closed and insulated against the outside world. The men dress in traditional 19th Century religious garb and devote their lives to Torah study, while the women are required to dress very modestly and are mainly responsible for childrearing and supporting the household. It is strongly frowned upon for a woman to draw attention by placing herself in the public spotlight, and the campaign has been a difficult one for Mrs Porat. There is another sector of Jerusalem society battling to have its voice heard, but most of its population won't even be voting. The Palestinians of East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and therefore cannot vote in national elections. But they are officially residents of the city, and as such have the right to vote in local elections. However, most of them will be boycotting the polls out of protest against the Israeli occupation and what they say is discrimination against their community by local government. Khaled Saheb owns a small denim shop in the Old City souk just inside Damascus Gate. He used to be a microbiologist, but took over his family's business after his father died. He complains that living conditions are much worse on the eastern side of the city than on the western, mostly Jewish, side, and longs for a day when the Palestinians will be able to govern themselves in a state of their own. Making Jerusalem more enjoyable for its residents has become almost like a mission for Dor Sircovich, owner of the popular local pub Bolinat and part of the city's decreasing secular population. Many secular people complain that the city is becoming too religious, and resent the encroachment of ultra-Orthodox families on their neighbourhoods. Large numbers of secular residents, including many friends of Mr Sircovich, have been leaving for more liberal places like Tel Aviv. But he is determined to stay. His pub serves non-kosher food and is open on the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat), therefore serving only the city's non-religious public. Shabbat in Jerusalem means almost everything is closed down from Friday afternoon to Saturday evening. Dor Sircovich wishes there was more entertainment spots like his, more places open on Shabbat, and less religious power over city life. He hopes that the city's religious and non-religious population can find a way to live together in harmony, and to that end is even planning to open up a kosher restaurant, right next to his non-kosher pub, so that both groups can have common ground to connect and interact. For now, the city remains divided, along a lot of different political, religious and ideological lines. It remains to be seen if a new local council can make any significant change in one of the most loved and contested cities in the world. Video by Alon Farago; Photographs by Noam Sharon </body>

      <description>India's planned Mars launch stokes Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <body>Since its invention, the car has been a photographers' favourite. The sleek lines have often been an inspiration and that mythical promise of freedom has to some extent been created by the photos and cinematic images. But the car requires fuel, and it is that which forms the basis of a new book consisting of archive press images of petrol stations - or gas stations as they are known in the US, where most of the photos in David Campany's Gasoline originate. The photographs are drawn from archives of several American newspapers that have been discarding their analogue print collections in favour of digital storage. Many are marked up with chinagraph pencil, outlining the crop required for a particular story layout in the newspaper. Some depict the fuel crisis of the early 1970s, others show accidents and some appear to be press events for the promotion of a certain model. In an interview with George Kaplan that appears at the back of the book, Campany describes how the book began. "I came across the shot of the woman with her head in her arms at the wheel of her car. Her name was Pat Sullivan and she was waiting in line for gas in Baltimore, 1979. I thought it was such a beautiful image. The hair and her car have been retouched, almost as if the newspaper wanted her to look her best even at this low point." Yet the photograph is only part of the story. Flick through to the second half of the book and you will find pictures of the reverse of the prints, offering caption information, the name of the photographer and copyright holder as well as dates of publication and much more. It is data that brings the images to life and to some extent removes the nostalgic glow the pictures have on their own. Photographs such as these can have many lives. As a news photograph to illustrate the story of the day, as a social document and possibly even as art for the gallery wall. But however you see these pictures, as archives shed their hard copy prints it is good to see that somewhere a small selection has been preserved, not in the dark recess of an archive but on the shelves of both photographic and car enthusiasts. Gasoline by David Campany is published by Mack. </body>

      <title>Singapore's mid-life crisis</title>
      <description>How citizens are finding a voice and challenging power</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24540080</url>
      <date>1382314509</date>

      <body>When I was living in Singapore 13 years ago, the government was debating a decision that in other countries might have seemed rather trivial: whether or not to permit a version of Speakers' Corner, the spot in London's Hyde Park where individuals vent their opinions on whatever topic they choose to whoever wants to listen. The year before, the then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had worried that his country was not ready for such an innovation. But in September 2000 a location was finally approved, in Hong Lim Park, near the city centre. Being Singapore, this "free speech forum" was a regulated one. Speakers needed police permission before they could use the space. Like so many other aspects of Singapore's "disciplinarian" state, their Speakers' Corner provoked plenty of wry comment by foreign journalists. Few people turned out to hear the first anodyne speeches. The common assumption was that Singaporeans were not interested in risking trouble with their government by listening to speeches. They would rather go shopping. But guess what? Speakers' Corner has become the venue for a number of quite lively demonstrations recently, over an issue which has provoked more debate than at any time since the country's tumultuous birth 48 years ago - immigration. Those demonstrations, though, are still subject to regulations. They cannot say or do anything that might stir up racial tension or disturb public order. The really heated debate has been on the internet - howls of anguish by self-styled "heartlanders" - original Singaporeans - and vitriolic denunciations of the ruling People's Action Party over the rapid rise in the number of foreigners, both low-wage immigrant workers and the wealthy individuals from the rest of Asia who now view Singapore as a safe-haven for their millions. Foreigners now make up close to 40% of the 5.3 million-strong population. They are blamed both for the stratospheric rise in property prices and for squeezing local people out of jobs. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said three years ago he was quite happy to invite the world's richest man to live in Singapore, if it increased the country's net wealth. But the conspicuous presence in Singapore today of so many of the world's super-rich is leaving many lower-income people feeling left behind. That debate reached boiling point earlier this year when a government white paper predicted that by 2030, the population would expand to just under seven million, of which only a little over half would be Singaporeans. The public outcry prompted the government to issue a clarification; the figures were a forecast, not a target, it said. This might seem odd for a country which is after all built on immigration, and which has already achieved the world's highest per capita GDP. But it is part of a wider sense of unease you hear being expressed over what, and whom, Singapore is for. Goh Chok Tong has called it Singapore's "mid-life crisis". It helps to explain the success of a younger generation of opposition politicians at the last election in 2011. With its share of the vote dropping to just over 60%, the ruling PAP had its worst result since independence. It is worth remembering that Singapore is as much a concept as a country, an artificial creation forced on its people by its expulsion from Malaysia in 1965. It is a tiny city-state in an era of nation states. It does not have great historical narratives or national myths to define its existence. Instead it has always been defined by the performance of its government, both in utilising the limited living space and resources it has, and in ensuring better living standards for its people. The manner in which the government does this was set down by Singapore's domineering founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. He imposed top-down, rigorously-planned modernisation, with curbs on individual freedom - a government-knows-best strategy he later described as "Asian Values". The best and brightest were attracted to the top ranks of the PAP and the government with generous salaries to carry this out. If this is a nanny state, he wrote later, then I am proud to have fostered one. For decades Singaporeans accepted this arrangement, with only minor grumbling. Not any more. Bukit Brown is an old Chinese cemetery, close to the centre of the island. Some of the earliest Chinese settlers to arrive in Singapore, when it was a British-ruled trading colony, are buried there. They include Lee Kuan Yew's grandfather. The elaborate tombs and gravestones are a rich historic resource, in a country which has lost much of its heritage in the name of progress. It is also a wonderfully overgrown green space in a mostly built-up city. The government currently plans to drive a four-lane highway through the cemetery to ease traffic congestion. In years gone by this might have gone through with only a few mutterings of complaint. This time the government's plans have run into a sophisticated civic protest movement. "The way the government works is always to frame the issue as heritage versus development, and nothing in between", said Catherine Lim, who co-founded one of the Bukit Brown conservation campaigns. "What we're trying to do is reframe the conversation to include heritage as part of development. I think they realise these things are important. This sense of loss for many Singaporeans who have lost the familiar landmarks they grew up with, it's also very much to do with the fact that we are almost like a foreign country now - we have so many foreigners." The government has not altered its plans yet. But there was a striking change of tone, if not direction, in the annual independence day speech given this year by Lee Hsien Loong, who happens to be Lee Kuan Yew's son. Gone was the typically confident list of achievements by the PAP, now in its sixth decade in office. Instead, Mr Lee offered a frank acknowledgement of the unhappiness felt by many lower-income people. Singaporeans, he said "are feeling uncertain and anxious" because "technology and globalisation are widening our income gaps and in addition to that, we have domestic social stresses building". Our country is at a turning point, he said. "I understand your concerns. I promise you, you will not be facing these challenges alone because we are all in this together." There was talk of better access to education, of wider healthcare cover, and more access to low-cost housing. There seemed to be an effort in the speech by Mr Lee to offer empathy, rather than statistics, a realisation that the Mandarin-style meritocracy built by his father may no longer be enough to retain the loyalty of Singaporeans. In a statement to the BBC a government spokesman re-iterated the long-standing belief, that as a small, open economy, Singapore must remain open and connected, for trade or talent flows. But, the statement said, "we are deliberately slowing our foreign workforce growth rate. This will also slow economic growth, but it is a compromise we need to make to continue to give Singaporeans a high quality of life." "I see that the government is changing," said Mallika Naguran, who runs a sustainability website called Gaia Discovery. "They are becoming more transparent, more approachable, taking definite steps towards sustainability. Yet this could still improve. There could be more openness in policy-making, more access for civic groups to become stakeholders in nation-building". The passing of Lee Kuan Yew, who has just turned 90 years old and is in frail health, will be another turning point for this micro-state, a moment when its citizens will once again contemplate their uncertain future. The elder Mr Lee has always taken a pessimistic view of his country's vulnerability. He wept publicly when it was ejected from Malaysia and has repeatedly warned his citizens not to relax their vigilance, whether it was against communist subversion in the 1960s, or against the declining birth-rate in the 21st Century. In one of his most recent statements he pondered gloomily whether Singapore would even exist in 100 years time. It was down to the competence of the government, he said. If we get a dumb government, we are done for. That view is being increasingly challenged, mostly within the relatively safe confines of the internet, but with vigorous, sometimes angry exchanges of views. The era of government-knows-best is slowly coming to an end in Singapore. No-one is quite sure what will take its place. </body>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $4.7bn (£2.9bn) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <title>Triple killer gets life sentence</title>
      <description>A convicted killer who murdered a man going to the aid of a neighbour in a Hertfordshire village is jailed for life.</description>

      <body>A triple killer who admitted the fatal stabbing of a man in a Hertfordshire village has been jailed for life. Ian John McLoughlin, 55, pleaded guilty to the murder of Graham Buck, 66, in Little Gaddesden, last July, while he was a day release prisoner. Mr Buck was stabbed when he went to help his neighbour, Francis Cory-Wright, 86, who was being robbed. Sentencing McLoughlin at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Sweeney said he must serve a minimum of 40 years. McLoughlin was on day release from prison where he was serving a life term for the murder of Brighton barman Peter Halls, whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992. He had previously been jailed for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, 49, in 1984, whom he hit over the head with a hammer after a row, before leaving his body in a cupboard. Mr Justice Sweeney said that he was barred from passing a whole life term because of a European judgment that those sentences are in breach of human rights. The court heard McLouglin turned up at Mr Cory-Wright's house claiming to need help setting up a charity supporting elderly ex-offenders. But McLoughlin suddenly grabbed him and demanded to know where he kept his "gold and silver". He tied Mr Cory-Wright to the bed, stuffed silver family heirlooms into a pillowcase and demanded his bank cards and Pin numbers. Father-of-three Mr Buck, who lived two doors away from Mr Cory-Wright, went to help him after hearing shouting in his front garden. McLoughlin told police he was "sorry" for what he did to Mr Buck. He said he was confronted by Mr Buck as he tried to flee Mr Cory-Wright's house, and stabbed him in the neck. Witnesses described seeing Mr Buck with his throat slashed "wide open", prosecutor Ann Evans said. The court heard that Mr Buck's wife, Karen, said her life had been "turned upside down" by her husband's death. Shortly before his murder he had returned from a long weekend in Poland, where he met his baby granddaughter for the first time. Mr Buck was born in London and lived in Surrey and Sussex before moving to Hertfordshire in 1995. Since his retirement he had worked as a non-executive director at Aldwyck Housing Association in Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire. Mr Buck, who was described by his family as a "truly genuine person" had two sons, a daughter and two grandchildren. In July, Det Ch Supt Jeff Hill said: "Mr Buck's actions were totally selfless and illustrate a deep sense of community spirit which deserves recognition and respect." McLoughlin was jailed for 10 years in October 1983 for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, who lived in Stoke Newington. This sentence was reduced to eight years on appeal. McLoughlin was convicted of the murder of barman Peter Halls, 56, in Brighton in July 1992, who had offered him work. McLoughlin stabbed him in the neck. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years. McLoughlin said he assumed Mr Halls was gay, and thought that he may be expected to sleep with him. Ms Evans said: "The defendant claimed that Mr Halls confessed to liking young boys and... that he took holidays in Morocco for under-age sex." McLoughlin stabbed Mr Halls several times, and in 1992 was jailed for 25 years for murder, serving a total of 21 years behind bars, when he was allowed out on day release. </body>

      <title>30,000 tonnes of Tesco food 'wasted'</title>
      <description>Supermarket giant Tesco reveals it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of the year.</description>

      <body>Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013. Using its own data and industry-wide figures, it also estimated that, across the UK food industry, 68% of salad to be sold in bags was wasted - 35% of it thrown out by customers. And it estimated 40% of apples and 47% of bakery items in the UK were wasted. The retailer is introducing measures to reduce wastage including developing promotions for smaller bags of salad. The latest figures published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) suggested 15 million tonnes of food went to waste in the UK in 2010. Figures for 2012 will be published next month. Publishing its food waste figures for the first time, Tesco said that, in the first six months of this year, its stores and distribution centres generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste. But it said that, where possible, if food could not be sold it was either donated to poverty charity FareShare, converted into animal feed for livestock, or was recycled into renewable fuel. Prime Minister David Cameron recently praised the FareShare charity and, on Monday, his spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing: "There will be widespread concern about levels of food that go to waste and that's why the prime minister has noted the excellent work that FareShare does." Tesco has also given wastage estimates for the 25 best-selling products across the UK food industry as a whole. The figures were based on waste data from Tesco supermarkets, distribution centres, suppliers and producers - combined with Wrap figures on levels of waste in UK homes. It estimated that 24% of grapes were wasted between the vine and the fruit bowl and that a fifth of all bananas were unused - with one-in-10 thrown away by customers. Tesco said it addressing the problem of waste by ending multi-buys on large bags of salad, removing "display until" dates from fresh fruit and vegetables, using smaller cases in stores, and rearranging 600 in-store bakeries to reduce the amount of bread on display. And it said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease. Other measures to tackle the problem would include providing simple tips to customers about storing fruit, Tesco said. It said it would also share tips about how to use leftover bread, adding it was working with grape and banana suppliers to improve delivery times and conditions. Matt Simister, Tesco's commercial director of group food, said there was "no quick-fix single solution" to tackling food waste. "Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin," he said. "We're playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. "Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we'll be reviewing what else we can do." He said Tesco was working with its suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork. Richard Swannell, director of Wrap, said: "We welcome Tesco's approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. "Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so." Investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman, meanwhile, said consumers were being "ripped off" by supermarket promotions - especially those involving fresh food. "What we could say to consumers is 'wise up'," she told the BBC News Channel. "The minute you walk into the supermarket you may be able to get a few bargains but, more likely than not, you'll be nudged into buying stuff you didn't really want or need and it will go in the bin." </body>

      <body>The mother of a British child who went missing in Greece in 1991 has said the case of a girl allegedly abducted by a Roma couple has given her "fresh hope". A blonde girl called Maria, aged five or six, was found at a Greek Roma camp last week, and a couple who claimed to be her parents were arrested. Kerry Needham, whose son Ben was abducted in Kos aged 21 months, said she always believed gypsies took Ben. She said Greek police must now "investigate the gypsy theory further". Ms Needham said Maria's case had given her family "fresh hope and maximum publicity", and she remained certain Ben would be found. She told the BBC Greek authorities had suggested it would be "impossible" to conceal a blonde-haired child in a gypsy encampment, but the case of Maria - who has blonde hair - proved that wrong. She said the family had repeatedly claimed Ben had been taken by gypsies, but Greek police had always "strongly denied" the possibility. Ben, from Sheffield, went missing while on a family holiday in Kos. Ms Needham said she was in contact with South Yorkshire Police, but the force said there appeared to be "no direct correlation" between the cases of her son and Maria. A spokesman added: "No investigation is currently being carried out by the force in light of this recent case and officers from South Yorkshire Police will only become involved should authorities in Greece require our assistance." The girl named Maria was found in central Greece when police, who were carrying out a raid looking for drugs and weapons, noticed the lack of resemblance between the child and the couple claiming to be her parents. Officers checked documents, and DNA tests later revealed Maria was not related to the couple. A fake birth certificate suggested she was four years old, but the charity now caring for her says medical examinations have revealed she is probably five or six. A lawyer for the Roma couple has said Maria was given to them, not kidnapped. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, parents of Madeleine McCann, said the case of Maria had given them hope, according to the Daily Mirror. Madeleine was three years old when she was abducted in Portugal in 2007, and police investigating her disappearance have received more than 2,400 calls since an appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme was broadcast last week. </body>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>Don't cut our expenses, say MPs</title>
      <description>A powerful group of MPs rejects a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses for hotels, second homes, TVs, taxis and tea and biscuits.</description>

      <body>A powerful MPs' group has rejected a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wants to ban claims for tea and biscuits and installing televisions in second homes. It also proposes cutting costs on hotel bills and evening meals. But the Commons Standards Committee insists that other professionals would be able to claim such expenses in compensation for unsociable hours. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up following the MPs' expenses scandal of 2009 and it has frequently come into conflict with those whose behaviour it was set up to police. In its latest report, it proposed MPs should get a £7,000 pay rise. But it said they should no longer be able to claim for: Ipsa says these perks cost the taxpayer £161,000 in 2011/12, about £250 per MP, and that most professional people would be expected to pay for them themselves. But the Standards Committee, in its formal submission to Ipsa's consultation, disagrees, saying MPs are like police, solicitors and junior doctors and should be able to claim expenses in compensation for "regular unsocial hours or residence away from home". It adds: "Practices vary widely within and between professions. In some professions there is indeed no reimbursement for unsocial hours and the associated costs of those hours but salaries may be supplemented to compensate." The committee is asking Ipsa to "establish an evidence base for the proposals", adding: "We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses." It says: "We find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 0100 before booking a hotel." On the curb on taxis before 2300, the committee says: "We are also concerned about the effects of such rules on members' ability to perform their duties effectively. "We note that many committees begin work at 08.55, and members are expected to attend regardless of the hour at which they ended their work the night before." And on the ban on claims for getting a TV installed, it says: "Since MPs' work involves being informed and available at virtually any hour, we consider access to media and the internet when residing away from home is a legitimate business expense." The consultation on the proposals - including the pay rise - ended on Sunday. Ipsa says it will announce its final decision on both pay and conditions before Christmas. </body>

      <title>School gates smokers abuse principal</title>
      <description>A head teacher in south London is targeted for abuse after asking parents to stop smoking outside the school gates.</description>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. "I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <body>Police are looking at CCTV and speaking to witnesses in a bid to find two young children who they say were taken from a hotel room in Stoke-on-Trent. Na'llah Khan, two, and her 10-month-old brother Sulailman were staying at the Quality Inn Hotel, Hanley, with family. They were taken by their father, Saleem Tahir, 40, who is originally from the Nottingham area, on Friday evening. Police believe all three are in Birmingham with Mr Tahir's mother, 67-year-old Denise Smith-Sellers. Mr Tahir forced his way past an elderly relative of the children after entering their hotel room, police said. They were last seen on the Bristol Road in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at about 20:00 BST on Friday. Detectives are looking at CCTV, talking to other police forces and speaking to witnesses. Ch Insp Jane Hewitt, from Staffordshire Police, said: "Our priority is the safe return of the children. "We believe that Saleem, Denise and the children are still in Birmingham and would urge them to contact us immediately on 101 so we can talk to them to resolve this situation." </body>

      <body>A 29-year-old man has been charged with the theft of a Labour MP's mobile phone in 2010. Michael Ankers, from south-west London, is accused of stealing the phone belonging to Siobhain McDonagh. He was charged under Operation Tuleta, a Scotland Yard investigation focused on computer hacking and other alleged privacy breaches. Prosecutors have said a Sun journalist, Nick Parker, will also face charges related to the alleged theft. Both men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 November. Operation Tuleta began in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. It is being run by the Metropolitan Police alongside Operation Elveden, which is an investigation into inappropriate payments to public officials, and Operation Weeting, the Met's phone-hacking inquiry. Ms McDonagh, who has represented Mitcham and Morden since 1997, had her mobile phone stolen from her car in Colliers Wood in south-west London on 17 October 2010. The Crown Prosecution Service has said Mr Parker, 52, from south-west London, will face two charges - one of receiving stolen goods and one of unauthorised access to computer material. </body>

      <body>A Wolves fan who missed his first home game since 1976 to attend his stepdaughter's wedding is to be presented to the next home crowd to "mark his loyalty and support". Peter Abbott, from Ipswich, missed Saturday's match but will be back in Wolverhampton for Tuesday's fixture. The club sent its record goalscorer Steve Bull to the wedding as a surprise when it heard he would miss the match. It now intends to make a presentation to him on the pitch at the next match. Mr Abbott has been a fan of League One Wolverhampton Wanderers since 1970 and the last home match he missed was against Tottenham on 16 March 1976. He regularly makes the 330-mile (530km) round trip to the Molineux ground to see his team, but had to follow Saturday's 1-1 draw with Coventry by text, while attending the family wedding. He said he was "gutted" when he first realised the wedding of stepdaughter Sarah Butler and Jonathan Liddle coincided with the game. However, Wolves heard of his plight and decided to send Steve "Bully" Bull along with a signed shirt and programme from the match, to "soften the blow". Mr Abbott said it was "a big surprise" and described Bull as "a legend". Paul Richards, Wolves' supporter liaison officer, said: "We were only too happy to work with the sponsors... in getting Bully to attend the reception on Saturday, and are pleased it helped make Peter's day." He added: "There are many [fans] with great stories about how many games they have attended, but I'm not sure any can match the achievement of Peter in not missing a home game in 34 years. "We now want to mark his continuing loyalty and support of the club by making a presentation to him during half-time of Tuesday night's Oldham game. "In typical Peter fashion, he has already warned us that after being away from Molineux on Saturday, he doesn't want to miss a single second of the game so we must have him back in his seat well in advance of the start of the second half." </body>

      <body>Northern Ireland Finance Minister Simon Hamilton has announced that a new children's hospital is to be built in Belfast. The £250m facility will replace the existing hospital on the Royal site in Belfast. The announcement was made as part of a reallocation of unspent funds, mainly from the stalled A5 road project. The Department of Health has been allocated £52m, £15.5m of which is to go towards the new hospital. It is expected to be completed by 2020/2021. The department has also been allocated £14m to address waiting lists. Mr Hamilton said he had recently visited the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and was "shocked and ashamed" by the conditions. Building on the new hospital could begin next year. Other health projects allocated money include: Mr Hamilton has also given the green light to dualling the Frosses Road section of the A26. "The allocations I have announced today will leave a lasting economic impact on Northern Ireland, boost our economy as the recovery gathers momentum and provide assistance for vulnerable people in our society," Mr Hamilton said. "I am especially pleased that we are able to fund a new regional children's hospital and significant strategic roads improvements." Health Minister Edwin Poots said the money would help provide services fit for the 21st century for children. "A replacement regional children's hospital is a major project that I have been keen to take forward, particularly as parts of the current facilities are nearly 100 years old," he said. "Securing this additional funding from the executive provides me with the opportunity to move this much needed project forward to ensure that our children will receive their care and treatment in a modern paediatric environment." </body>

      <title>Shankill bomber apology dismissed</title>
      <description>A man whose wife was killed in the 1993 Shankill bomb says one of the bomber's apology is meaningless.</description>

      <body>A man whose wife was killed in the 1993 Shankill bomb has said he does not believe one of the IRA bombers who apologised about the lives lost. IRA man Thomas Begley and nine Protestant civilians were killed in the 1993 attack in Belfast. On Sunday, a memorial ceremony was held for Begley. The other bomber, Sean Kelly, told the crowd he was sorry for the loss of life. Alan McBride, whose wife died in the blast, said his apology was hollow. "He (Kelly) went out that day, I have no doubt he was trying to murder UDA men upstairs in that shop, so I'm not suggesting for a minute my wife was the intended target, but she wasn't even considered, her life wasn't even considered that it was worth anything," Mr McBride said. "He left that bomb on the counter and the timescale for them getting out of that was so small that they had to have known the potential for innocent casualties to be taken that day was huge and that's exactly what happened. "So for Sean Kelly to come out now and say he's sorry, I don't really believe him." Charlie Butler, who lost three relatives in the attack - his niece Evelyn Baird, her partner Michael Morrison and their seven-year-old daughter Michelle - said the apology was "20 years too late". "I don't think any apology will bring back what happened," he said. He said he respected the right of the Begley family to remember their son, but added: "I think there's better ways of remembering your son than being a child murderer and a murderer of women and pensioners." During Sunday's ceremony, Billy Begley, Thomas Begley's father unveiled a plaque stating that the bomber "died on active service" and is "always remembered by his many comrades and friends". In a brief speech at the ceremony, his father, thanked the crowd and said: "As you well know, this is not a celebration or a glorification of that tragic day that happened. It's also (not to) degrade the innocent people on the Shankill Road." The crowd was also addressed by Sean Kelly, the IRA man who was with Begley on the day and survived the bomb. He described it "an IRA operation that went tragically wrong". "I offer no excuse that will change how any of these innocent people and families will think about myself or Thomas or the IRA as a result of this operation. I am truly sorry for the loss of life and the injuries that were suffered that day and for the suffering the families have endured," Kelly added. There were two protests against the commemoration, one involving victims families and another one staged by loyalist youths on the Crumlin Road. The nine other people killed in the IRA attack included two children age seven and 13. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in October in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. Begley and Kelly posed as fishmongers and carried the bomb into Frizzell's fish shop where shoppers were queuing for food. In addition to the 10 deaths, a further 57 people were injured by the bomb. The wounded included Kelly, who was pulled from the rubble of the collapsed building. He received a total of nine life sentences for his role in the attack but was released early in July 2000, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Families of some of the Shankill bomb victims condemned the commemoration when the plans emerged earlier this month. The Begley family, from Ardoyne in north Belfast, had previously publicly stated their opposition to the Shankill Road bombing and their son's role in the IRA attack. Last week, the bomber's brother, Sean Begley, told the Belfast News Letter that his family had not been involved in producing the flyer or the plaque tribute, but would be attending the memorial service to mark the 20th anniversary of his death. Michelle Williamson, who lost both her parents in the explosion, wrote a personal letter to Begley's parents, asking them to call off the ceremony. She told them she had "no problem in acknowledging your loss" but said the unveiling of the plaque to a bomber was "a sick and cruel insult to the memory of our loved ones". </body>

      <body>Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away after 14 caravans moved onto the 300-space area. Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on. He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result. But one hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said it was "infuriating". "Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing," the worker said. "I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. "There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. "They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp." Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: "Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. "It just shouldn't be allowed to happen. "It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. "I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon." Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately 65 spaces. "We will ensure that security is available on site from 6am-10pm every day to reassure and support staff," he said. "We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible - there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible. "There has been no disruption to hospital services and, in the main, staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning." </body>

      <title>Enterprise zone jobs 'in pipeline'</title>
      <description>The first minister says there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones, as he also announces 100 new jobs in the Cardiff zone.</description>

      <body>The first minister has said there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones. Carwyn Jones' comments came as he announced accountancy firm Deloitte will create 100 jobs in the Cardiff zone over the next three years. He also announced a cut in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Welsh Conservatives say the enterprise zones still have "a long way to go". At his monthly press conference, the first minister defended his Welsh government's enterprise zone policy saying they "are the envy of the rest of the UK". There are seven enterprise zones in Wales, each dedicated to nurture specific industries. Companies have access to a range of benefits, including business rate relief, enhanced capital allowances, skills support, superfast broadband, bespoke infrastructure projects and simplified planning rules. Carwyn Jones said almost 2,000 jobs have been created across the seven zones, with a further 6,500 planned, 3,000 of them in the Cardiff zone. Located in the centre of the capital, a further 100 jobs are set to be created in the zone dedicated to financial services as financial advisory firm Deloitte's is set to expand. Deloitte will set up the Cardiff Centre of Excellence to support its International Assignment Services, helping employers meet tax compliance. The Welsh government has invested £170,000 into the project, which will centralise client administration and support. Carwyn Jones welcomed the news at the firm's Cardiff headquarters. "This latest expansion which is set to create 100 jobs in Cardiff sends out a strong message that Wales is becoming the location of choice for companies operating in the professional and financial services sector that are looking to grow their business," he said. "I am hugely encouraged that Cardiff has been selected and confident this latest project will build on the success of their quality and risk operations team in Cardiff. "Wales is the first place in the UK with an enterprise zone dedicated to this sector and Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone is helping to enhance the city's position as a capital location for professional business services." Shadow Minister for Business Nick Ramsay AM, said: "This is extremely welcome news - and long overdue. "Progress on the Labour government's enterprise zone in Cardiff has been disappointingly slow - and today's announcement is a step in the right direction. "In the two years since this zone's announcement, very little has been announced and very few details released. "There is a long way to go on every enterprise zone in Wales and I am pleased that some progress is finally being made." The first minister also announced SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment bank. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to look at the bank's interest rates more widely. Eluned Parrott AM, said: "This announcement will be welcomed by small and medium sized businesses planning on investing in Enterprise Zones, however, questions still have to be answered as to why Finance Wales's interest rates are higher than they need to be across the country. "I do hope that the Welsh Government will look seriously at the interest rates it is offering through Finance Wales across the country, and take action to ensure that its rates are comparable with the market not unnecessarily expensive for companies who are trying to create wealth and encourage growth." The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the announcement raises some questions. FSB Welsh Policy Unit chair Janet Jones said: "The announcement of a 2% cut in rates from Finance Wales for businesses in Welsh enterprise zones is welcome, but rather perplexing. "The Welsh government's own report into access to finance by Professor Dylan Jones-Evans noted that Finance Wales' interest rates were often well above their regulatory requirements. "FSB Wales agrees with that assessment, and this announcement suggests that there is more flexibility in Finance Wales' setting of its interest rates than was previously stated. "In the light of this announcement we would call for Finance Wales to re-examine its rates as it appears that state aid rules do not require rates to be as high as they are at present," she added. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth deal deadline approaches</title>
      <description>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos.</description>

      <body>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos. The firm said that, by Sunday, it had received about 300 positive returns out of a workforce of 1,350. But the Unite union said it had been given more than 500 forms rejecting the offer on pay and pensions. The union has asked its 1,100 members at Grangemouth not to hand the forms to Ineos. It has accused the company of giving workers an ultimatum of accepting worse pay and conditions or losing their job. The 2.6 square-mile refinery and petrochemical site was shut down ahead of a planned strike by Unite members. It remains closed despite the 48-hour strike, which had been due to begin on Sunday, being called off. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. Calum MacLean, chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the company had received "around 300" forms by Sunday. Mr MacLean said he expected most of the returns to come in on Monday, and he "remained pretty confident" there would be strong support for the company from workers. He added: "Getting the plant back up and running again is not about necessarily the number of people, albeit that will influence when we can start it. "What is important here is that we have asked the unions to give us an assurance that there will be no strike action during the consultation period, which is the 45 to 60 days when we are going to sit down and negotiate with the employees and talk about the changes we are trying to impose. "People need to realise that this site has lost £150m per year for the last four years. It has got a pension fund which is £200m in deficit and it is on the point of going bust. "If it wasn't because of the support of the shareholders, who are funding those losses, then there is a very, very serious situation here which means the site may not start up again". Ineos has put forward what it calls a survival plan for Grangemouth and warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. These changes were detailed in letters sent to staff at the end of last week. They include freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support its survival plan at this stage will receive a transitional payment of up to £15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Unite said it had strongly advised its members at Grangemouth not to return the forms backing the changes to their contract. It accused Ineos of "bribes and blackmail". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, told Good Morning Scotland: "We have continuously given assurances of no strikes from now up until December. "In fact yesterday (Sunday), when we had a rally here, I gave a commitment that we would have no strikes for however long it took to allow negotiations to take place between ourselves and Ineos on the survival plan. We are not imposing any conditions. "Ineos wants to come to the negotiating table at the same time as threatening our members and threatening people here with the sack in 45 days. You can't negotiate and impose at the same time." Mr Rafferty said he expected the majority of workers have would reject the new pay and conditions. First Minister Alex Salmond repeated his calls for Ineos to "fire up the plant" and for Unite to commit to a "no strike - without strings - guarantee" at the SNP conference in Perth. Ineos shareholders are due to discuss the future of the complex on Tuesday. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who is scheduled to meet with Ineos later this week, urged the company to "withdraw the ultimatums delivered to the workforce". She said: "The company should also undertake to immediately reopen the plant and return to production and both the union and the company should return to meaningful talks, with Acas if necessary, to deliver a solution to this matter which has serious consequences for Scotland and the UK." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <body>A Lancashire woman who suffered brain damage in a quad bike accident in Australia has been awarded about £175,000 in compensation. Holly Raper, of Chorley, was working on a farm on King Island, Tasmania, when she came off the bike in December 2011. Doctors say she will need round-the-clock care for the rest of her life. Farmers David and Jocelyn Bowden were told to pay Ms Raper's mother the sum, the maximum amount allowable under Tasmanian legislation. At a Tasmanian Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Tribunal, Chief Commissioner Stephen Carey said Ms Raper, who was 21 at the time of the accident, had sustained "catastrophic neurological injury". She is being looked after by her mother and professional carers at her home. It is believed Ms Raper, a keen photographer, was herding cows on the vehicle when she fell off. She remained in a coma for a number of months before being flown home. Her return to the UK was delayed as the insurance company said her policy did not cover work injuries. The Tasmanian government eventually paid for her return. The lump sum of about 290,000 Australian dollars was the maximum amount allowable and was ordered to be paid within seven days. </body>

      <body>A second man has been charged by police investigating the exploitation of migrant workers following a series of raids in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. Juris Valujevs, 35, of Turbus Road, King's Lynn, Norfolk, is accused of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster. He is also charged with fraud by false representation, conspiring to commit immigration offences and blackmail. Mr Valujevs appeared at Norwich Magistrates' Court on Saturday and was remanded in custody until October 24. On Thursday, Ivars Mezals, 27, of Conference Way, Wisbech, appeared before magistrates accused of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster, blackmail and fraud by false representation. He was remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 25 October. Eight other people detained after Tuesday's raids have been bailed. Two 44-year-old men from March, two men aged 26, both from Wisbech, and a 36-year-old woman, also from Wisbech, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, were given conditional bail last Wednesday. A 22-year-old woman from Wisbech, arrested on suspicion of possessing pepper spray, was bailed until 9 December. A 44-year-old man from March and a 27-year-old woman from Wisbech have been bailed until 7 November. Three recruitment agencies have also had their licences suspended by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). The raids were part of Operation Endeavour, which is looking into the working and living conditions of migrant agricultural workers - mainly from Lithuania and Latvia - in the Wisbech area of Cambridgeshire. </body>

      <title>Man Utd still in title race - Wenger</title>
      <description>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United can still win the Premier League despite their poor start.</description>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United are still involved in the Premier League title race. The Gunners are top of the table, eight points clear of the reigning champions, who have endured their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the standings. "Are Man United out of the title race? No, but of course 10 points starts to be a little gap," said Wenger. "They have big players, big experience and they are a big club." A late goal from Southampton's Adam Lallana denied United victory at Old Trafford on Saturday, with the south-coast club sitting sixth and holding a four-point advantage over David Moyes's side. In contrast, Arsenal's resounding 4-1 win over Norwich at the Emirates maintained their two-point advantage at the top of the league and extended their unbeaten run since their opening day defeat to Aston Villa. "If you have the choice, you want to be in the race at the top, but you cannot rule Man United out today," added Wenger. "It is too early." The Frenchman, whose side overturned United's 12-point lead to win the title in 1998, added that eight points can be retrieved quickly. "It is three games," said Wenger. "That is very quick in our league." Scrutiny of United's form has been intense since Moyes became manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since a 4-1 opening day win at Swansea, his side have only beaten the league's bottom two sides and have suffered defeats by Liverpool, Manchester City and West Brom. The run leaves them seven points worse off than at the same stage last season, when they eventually won the title by 11 points. BBC pundit Alan Hansen says the poor run of form is in danger of ending their hopes this term. "In terms of the title, they are certainly on the verge of losing it as a consequence of their unconvincing start to the season," Hansen wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.  "United were truly awful at times in the early weeks and months of last season, but the difference between then and now was that they dragged themselves to victories with the late surges that are missing now. "Maybe that is down to the 'Fergie factor', but it is more likely down to the inevitability that, sooner or later, the tide begins to turn." Former Everton manager Moyes has already admitted filling the void left by Ferguson after his 27 years and 38 trophies at Old Trafford will be difficult. Ex-United striker Dion Dublin, speaking to MOTD2 Extra, believes Ferguson is missed. "As a player who played at Old Trafford for Coventry and Villa, you sometimes lose the game before you get off the coach because you're in such awe of the stadium and players you are going to play against - and managers can be the same," said Dublin. "Ferguson's not there anymore, so players are thinking 'hold on, we've got a chance here'." </body>

      <body>Rory McIlroy says he is getting back to his best after finishing joint second in the Korean Open. The 24-year-old Northern Irishman carded five birdies in his final round to finish a shot behind winner Kang Sung-hoon. "Things are definitely on the up," said McIlroy. "I feel like I'm getting back to where I need to be. "I've had to stay patient this season - it hasn't been one of my best - but it's getting there, it definitely is." It was McIlroy's second top-five finish of a difficult year in which he has slipped to sixth in the world rankings.

McIlroy will play in the BWM Masters  on Thursday before taking part in the HSBC WGC Championships  a week later. Both tournaments are in Shanghai. "I'm excited about these next two weeks in China," McIlroy said. "They're a big two weeks for me to get a little bit of momentum for the end of the season and going into 2014.

      <title>Flare use 'a real worry' for police</title>
      <description>Police are worried about the rise in the use of flares in English football grounds after an assistant referee is hit by one.</description>

      <body>Police say the rising number of flares being taken into football grounds by supporters is "a real worry". Assistant referee David Bryan was hit by a flare during Sunday's match between Aston Villa and Tottenham. The head of football policing for the Association of Chief Police Officers, Andy Holt, said he was "anxious" to crack down on the problem. He told BBC Radio 5 live: "It is not appropriate to let off smoke flares or fireworks inside a stadium." The Football Association has launched an investigation into the incident at Villa Park. Two men aged 25 and 47 were arrested over the matter by West Midlands police and have been released on bail pending further enquiries. Deputy chief constable Holt said: "Last year, we saw an increase in the use of flares and pyrotechnic devices by nearly 140% compared to the previous season. "Arrests for the possession of a firework or a flare were up more than 150%, so it is certainly something we are seeing becoming more prevalent in today's game and it's a real worry for us. "It is prevalent abroad and I would argue they have a greater problem than we do in this country. But I'm anxious that we don't head the same way and it does not become embedded in the culture of English football. "It is no way appropriate to let off either smoke flares or fireworks inside a stadium. Those that argue that it gives a European flavour to the occasion are plain wrong." Bryan was struck on the back of the neck by a flare thrown from part of the ground where Tottenham supporters were seated. It was thrown moments after Andros Townsend gave Spurs the lead in the first half. Bryan was able to continue without treatment, although smoke from the flare delayed the restart of the game. In May, a 15-year-old boy suffered lung damage from a smoke bomb thrown during Villa's game at Wigan. The boy needed hospital treatment, while two women, aged 22 and 24, also required attention for the effects of the device, which was lit during the 2-2 draw. In August, Policing Minister Damian Green warned that fans  who smuggled flares and smoke bombs into games were putting the lives of other supporters at risk. The government's warning over the devices said they could burn as hot as 1,600 degrees Celsius for as long as an hour. In February, a 14-year-old boy was killed by a flare thrown by supporters during a South American Libertadores Cup match in Oruro, Bolivia. </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>It's the height of the British apple season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24578762</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70603000/jpg/_70603521_small-apples.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was £1.95/kg, Cox £1.75/kg and Pink Lady £3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink Lady® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <body>The BBC tried to open a bureau in Russia during World War II but only succeeded some 20 years later - in 1963. In the last half century, much has changed for the BBC's Man in Moscow. It was the summer of 1942 and Winston Churchill had flown to Russia to cement his wartime alliance with Joseph Stalin. "We will continue hand in hand like comrades and brothers," Churchill declared on arrival, "until every vestige of the Nazi regime has been beaten into the ground." Talk like this gave BBC bosses an idea. If Blighty and the Bolsheviks were suddenly best buddies, perhaps now was the moment to have a BBC correspondent based full-time in Moscow? So they sounded out the Soviets. And the answer came back: "Nyet!" A memo from the Assistant Controller of News written at the time reads: "The DG and editor-in-chief went to see the Soviet ambassador the other day and got no change at all. The Ambassador was extremely chilly. DG was left with the impression that nothing is likely to come of it." Mind you, it wasn't only Stalin who poured cold water on the idea. "I think all Moscow cover is a waste of time and money," argued the BBC Central European Correspondent. It was his job to report on Russia from the safety, and coffee-shop comfort of Vienna. In 1961 he tried to knock the whole idea on the head in a memo to his editor: "It is impossible in the USSR to get either official or unofficial reaction to anything except through the pages of the press the next day. Though this is often forgotten in London where it is naturally assumed correspondents will be able to go and talk to the renowned man-in-the-street. They can't. The opportunities for being a journalist are very slight indeed and to an experienced man this is very annoying." But when Soviet censorship eased under Nikita Khrushchev, the temptation to establish a permanent presence behind the iron curtain became irresistible and in 1963 the BBC finally opened a Moscow bureau. Erik de Mauny was the obvious choice for the BBC's first resident correspondent in the USSR. Not only did he have plenty of foreign reporting experience (previous postings included Vienna, Beirut and Washington), he also had a university degree in Russian. The BBC bought him a car, a dark green Humber Super Snipe, which had been specially adapted to cope with the cold. And to keep himself warm, the intrepid reporter had brought with him two key items - an ankle-length suede coat from Moss Bros and a pair of RAF flying boots. De Mauny wrote about his Moscow experiences in a book, Shouting Through the Static. Sadly, he died before it could be published. The manuscript reads like the screenplay for a James Bond film. Particularly the account of a scoop with a spook - his exclusive interview in 1964 with the spy, Kim Philby. The two men spent six hours in Philby's hotel suite getting drunk on vodka, wine and Armenian cognac, while Philby's KGB minder waited patiently in the corridor. Then de Mauny had a tough decision to make. I woke at 09:00 next morning with throbbing temples and with a realisation that I was in a dilemma. Should I send a news despatch to London about my meeting with Kim? What was more, should I mention it to any of my close colleagues? I knew I had a scoop, if I chose to play it that way, because apart from one brief sighting by a Reuters' correspondent some months earlier, no-one had tracked Kim down, still less talked to him at length as I had done. Nevertheless, I decided to wait. A news despatch would certainly make an impact, but it was highly likely to prove a nine-days wonder. I seemed to me sensible to keep my powder dry and wait to see whether my encounter with Kim might yield long-term benefits. After careful thought, however, I decided that the Embassy ought to be informed. So a bit later that morning, my hangover having subsided, I drove down to the big pseudo-Gothic mansion on the river embankment opposite the Kremlin. I found the Minister, Tom Brimelow, in his office and while we made small talk I slipped him a piece of paper on which I'd written: "I saw Kim Philby last night. Thought you might like to know about it." Tom contemplated this without emotion, but a few moments later he said, "That reminds me - I must have a word with the ambassador. I shan't be long." He was back a moment or two later with the ambassador, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, who gave me a brief nod. Then, with Tom leading, we made our way in silence down to the Embassy "safe room", a small basement room enclosed in an electronic shield in which one could talk without fear of being bugged... A day or so later, as I was crossing the courtyard (at home), I was intercepted by one of the first secretaries from the embassy, who handed me a folded piece of paper. "From the ambassador," he said, adding in a low voice, "better put it down the loo when you've read it." I opened the paper and saw that it contained a single typewritten sentence: "London advises break off contact." In my role as Moscow correspondent I have never had to scribble secret notes to embassy officials or participate in drinking sessions with secret agents. And yet, 50 years on, Moscow correspondents are still chasing spy stories. After all, espionage didn't end when the Cold War did. Like most foreign journalists in Moscow at the time, De Mauny assumed that his apartment was bugged. As frustrating as that may have been for his family, this created comical situations. During a visit to Moscow by the BBC's director general, Hugh Greene, and the head of BBC foreign liaison, Donald Stephenson, the correspondent invited his bosses - and British ambassador Sir Humphrey Trevelyan - back to his flat for a drink. Suddenly, Donald caught my eye. "I say, old boy, there's one thing I've been meaning to ask," he said. "Is it true that Mrs Furtseva is Khrushchev's mistress?" Before I could utter a word, Sir Humphrey had cut in. "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture," he said firmly. "Yes, I know," said Donald, not to be put off, "but is she Khrushchev's mistress?" The ambassador directed his gaze at the ceiling, and, this time in loud, decisive tones, once more declared: "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture!" I saw Donald open his mouth, as if to make a further try. Then, fortunately, the penny dropped. There was a moment of embarrassed silence, and we turned to other topics. It was from the Central Telegraph Office on Gorky Street that Erik de Mauny filed many of his stories. This sprawling construction was the communications hub of the Soviet Union - people came here to send telegrams, telexes, letters and to make long-distance calls. De Mauny would often book telephone lines to London hours in advance. At the allotted time he would turn up, go into a booth and voice his despatch. At least, that was the theory. But sometimes the lines never came up. This happened so often that de Mauny even wrote to the Soviet communications minister to complain. Since then, of course, technology has moved on. Today the Moscow correspondent can use his smart phone to broadcast live radio in quality, even to transmit TV pictures. As for the Central Telegraph, you can still send telegrams from there. But all those old Soviet telephone booths have been ripped out and replaced by a bank and a cafe. I checked out the cafe. The food is adequate, but not as exotic as some of the delicacies de Mauny was treated to in the 1960s. All foreign correspondents and the entire diplomatic corp based in Moscow would get invited to lavish banquets at the Kremlin. De Mauny interpreted it as an attempt by Khrushchev to impress the outside world: The chosen guests and members of the politburo were grouped behind the top table, while the rest of us circulated between the two long side tables. All three tables were lavishly laden with the most succulent dishes imaginable, from mounds of the finest Iranian caviar from the southern Caspian - plump globules of grey imperial malosol in crystal dishes surrounded by crushed ice - to great platters of smoked salmon and sturgeon... Meanwhile, waiters hurried among the guests with trays of delicious hot snacks, ice-cream and champagne, coffee and Armenian cognac. The Moscow correspondent today has fewer opportunities to dine in such decadence at the heart of Russian power. But, on the positive side, he has far more options for eating out than de Mauny ever did - today Moscow is awash with cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The supermarkets are better stocked, too, and many of them are open round the clock. The Soviet concept of "defitsit" or "shortage" has, thankfully, passed into history. Erik de Mauny spent three years in Moscow. During that time he covered such momentous events as the first woman cosmonaut in space and Nikita Khrushchev's fall from power. In 1966 he left Moscow and moved to the BBC's Paris bureau. But six years later he was back in the USSR for a second stint. In 1974 he reported the arrest of the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Only hours before, de Mauny had recorded Solzhenitsyn reading from his book, Gulag Archipelago. Now he needed to get that tape to London, fast. And it was de Mauny's wife Elizabeth, a fellow journalist, who came up with an ingenious solution. In a souvenir shop she bought a cassette recording of the Red Army choir. She took out the tape and put the Solzhenitsyn recording in its place. Then a family friend who was returning to London smuggled it out. Collectively they had beaten the system - with a little help from the Soviet military's finest voices. Having read de Mauny's memoirs, I'm struck both by what has changed in Russia over the last 50 years and by what hasn't. As a foreign correspondent based in Moscow, Erik de Mauny wasn't allowed to travel more than a few miles out of the Soviet capital without permission from the Soviet authorities. I have much more freedom to move around, although even today some parts of the country are still off-limits to me. And yet today, just like in 1963, dealing with officialdom can be problematic. I sense that many officials continue to view Western journalists with deep suspicion. De Mauny wrote that there were "so many contradictions between the warmth and generosity of individual friends and the sheer heartlessness of the system". That rings true now today. Russians who don't fit in with "the system" or who openly criticise it run the risk of being identified as troublemakers, even enemies of Russia. But there is one story in Russia today which I'm certain Erik de Mauny would have gained great pleasure and pride from telling. And it's 700 miles east of Moscow. I fly to the city of Perm in the Ural Mountains and attend a rehearsal at the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre. This is one of the oldest and most successful musical theatres in Russia. And the general manager and executive producer here is Marc de Mauny, the son of the BBC's first Moscow correspondent. Marc was just three when his father's second posting to Moscow ended in 1974. But, years later, he would return to study music at the St Petersburg Conservatory. He became fascinated by Russia, just like his father. "My father loved Russian culture, literature and music, and I think, unwittingly, he passed that on to me," Marc says. "I didn't wake up to that until I was 16 or 17 and wondering where to go for my gap year and what to study at university. And it came to me in a blinding flash that I'd like to study Russian and travel in Russia and discover this country which I'd heard so much about from my father. But I had grown up with Russia and the Soviet Union very much present as this vast, mysterious land. It was an emotional involvement. Russia is an emotional place." In a tiny practice room, spellbound, I watch a soloist putting heart and soul into a piece from Madame Butterfly. And I have to agree - Russia is an emotional place. This is a country of big hearts, great talents. But also huge problems and deep disappointments. Russia is beauty and beast. For the Moscow correspondent the challenge was, and always will be, to paint a complete picture. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Lib Dems showing 'school priorities'</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems are right to raise concerns about free schools in England as part of a pre-election drive to set out their own policies, a Cabinet minister says.</description>

      <body>The Lib Dems are right to raise concerns about free schools as part of a pre-election move to set out their priorities, a Cabinet minister says. Ed Davey suggested the party had backed aspects of education policy as a price of being in coalition with the Tories. It comes after Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the schools should employ only qualified teachers and adhere to the national curriculum. But the Conservatives have rejected calls for tighter controls. No 10 said the government's policy on free schools was clear and "there is no change to it". In a speech later this week, Mr Clegg will distance his party from part of the government's policy on free schools in England but has denied his comments represented a "great coalition crisis". Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but Mr Clegg is set to question this and other features of the schools which he will claim have been driven by Conservative "priorities". While insisting he continues to back the schools and will not interfere with education policy, Mr Clegg will insist that "core standards" of teaching and care must be met. Last week, the head teacher of a free primary school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the al-Madinah free school in Derby was judged by the education watchdog Ofsted to be "inadequate" in a number of areas. Mr Davey said told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his party leader was "right to say that when taxpayers are putting money into schools, they should expect minimum standards from the teachers". "People will be surprised we are embarking on a programme that could mean that lots of unqualified teachers are teaching our children," he added. Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position, saying that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Davey said it was not "surprising" that the Lib Dems and the Tories disagreed over aspects of education policy. Asked why Lib Dem ministers - including schools minister David Laws - had not spoken out earlier, Mr Davey said neither of the parties could have "their whole way" in a coalition and ministers were bound by collective responsibility to defend the agreed "government line". He added: "What Nick Clegg is showing is what our policy will be at the next election... "A party leader preparing for the next election and our manifesto, talking about party policies that have gone through a democratic vote at the Lib Dem conference. He has got to put those policies forward and he is right to do so." In a vote at the party's 2010 conference, Lib Dem activists rejected free schools and urged parents to boycott them, claiming they would worse educational outcomes for the majority of children and complicate admissions procedures. At the time, Lib Dem ministers made clear that "government policy was made by government ministers". Transport minister Baroness Kramer said she believed the public understood that Mr Clegg had a "dual role" as deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader, enabling him to talk about the party's future intentions as well as current policies. But Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Graham Stuart, the Conservative chair of the Commons Education Committee, said the Lib Dems' position was "strangely illiberal" and left Lib Dem schools minister Mr Laws in a "difficult position". "My understanding is that a typical Liberal view would be believing that you trust the front line to decide how and who should teach but you hold them strongly to account through exam results and Ofsted," he told Today. "I thought they believed in localism and, yet, here we are at the first sign of trouble and Nick Clegg comes over all Barbara Castle. It's a very peculiar approach." And Conservative peer Baroness Buscombe accused Mr Clegg of being "two-faced" and "grandstanding" in order to appeal to his party activists unhappy with some of the compromises of coalition. "Nick Clegg is trying to keep his head above water and appear big and strong," she told the BBC's Daily Politics. Labour, who have also been accused of changing their position, have said they would not close existing free schools but would not allow new ones to open under the government's existing model. Although parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local council control, local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. Shadow leader of the House of Lords Baroness Royall told the BBC that her party had sought guarantees on teacher qualifications when legislation authorising free schools was passed but the Lib Dems had opposed this. </body>

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <body>A high proportion of violent crimes and rapes committed against sex workers rarely result in convictions in the UK. The average national conviction rate for alleged rapes on sex workers is just 6.5%. The Greater London Authority's Silence on Violence report found that sex workers in London are at least 12 times more likely to be murdered than the national average. The report also found that sex workers felt they cannot safely report crime to the police. Writer Ruth Jacobs, formerly in prostitution herself, investigates why violent crimes against sex workers often go unpunished. She meets Fiona MacTaggart MP, from the All Parliamentary Group on Prostitution, who says the police need to do more to protect women in the sex trade from violent attacks and rape. The same offenders are often those who go on to attack other members of society. Inside Out looks at a revolutionary model of policing prostitution run by Merseyside Police which has a 67% success rate on convictions for rapes against sex workers. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One London and North West on Monday 21, October at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>

      <body>Britain's changing weather patterns have resulted in an increase in the number of landslides in recent years as the result of heavy summer and winter rainfall. Geologists from the British Geological Survey have been measuring landslides across the UK for almost 30 years and have created a database of every landslide reported. Inside Out's Marie Ashby meets the team based in Nottinghamshire which is using technology to predict future landslides to help reduce the risk of disasters. Recent events including a road slippage in Rothbury, Northumberland and a railway landslip at Stainforth, South Yorkshire illustrate the impact of landslips on communities. The collapse of a section of cliffs in Dorset also claimed the life of Charlotte Blackman from Derbyshire when she was on holiday a year ago. It is hoped new technology will allow the British Geological Survey team to link geology and weather to produce a daily landslide forecast and prevent similar accidents.

      <body>In April, the government ended Legal Aid for nearly all court cases in which separated couples were disputing access to their children. Ministers wanted people to try to settle things outside the courtroom - for example by using trained mediators. However, in the last six months the numbers of parents applying to go to court in England and Wales has risen, and the numbers using mediators falling dramatically. The Today programme's Tom Bateman heard from Andy, a parent who got Legal Aid before April 2013. He said if he had not received Legal Aid he would have "had to beg" the expert who was helping him. "I love my kids to bits, I want them with me every day," he explained. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday 21 October 2013. </body>

      <description>A new witness to the al-Hilli killings speaks</description>

      <body>A witness who claims to have seen the car thought to have been involved in the murders of three members of a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps last September, has spoken publicly for the first time. A forestry worker has told the BBC's Panorama programme he saw a British dark grey BMW shortly before the attack. We drive through the sleepy village of Chevaline up a narrow road leading high into the Alps. Rounding the corner we pull over at a parking spot called Le Martinet, hidden beneath the tree canopy. The mountains are shrouded in mist and amidst the rush of the stream and chatter of birds, it is hard to imagine the horror of what happened in this idyllic spot. Three members of the al-Hilli family - a father, mother and grandmother - were murdered at point blank range here. A seven-year-old child was left for dead and her four-year-old sister was so traumatised she was only discovered hiding underneath her dead mother's skirt in the back of the car eight hours after the emergency services arrived. Only Zaid al-Hilli, the brother of the driver of the car, has ever been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. He denies arranging the murders and is on bail. He has not been charged. I have come back to the scene with a British cyclist who discovered the crime to find out exactly what happened. Brett Martin, a former RAF pilot who has a holiday home in the area, set off for a cycle ride in the early afternoon of 5 September 2012. "I left the house at about 14:30 [with] no fixed route in my mind," he said. "It was sunny… [and] quite a peaceful, pleasant afternoon." He took the same narrow road up the mountain. Ahead of him was a French cyclist. On his way up he was overtaken by a vehicle which he believes was the al-Hilli's car. According to French police, the Al Hillis reached Le Martinet at about 15:40, having passed the French cyclist. Saad al-Hilli got out of the car with his seven year old daughter, Zainab. In less than a minute, Saad and his wife Iqbal, from Surrey, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, and the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, had been fatally shot. Zainab had been wounded but the gunman ran out of bullets and clubbed her with his gun. She survived but all she has been able to tell investigators about the killer is that she saw 'one bad man'. Coming up the hill at about 15:45, Brett Martin saw the motorcyclist escaping. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he said. When he arrived at the scene, Mr Martin initially thought he had come across a traffic accident. Realising there had been a shooting, he feared for his own life. "I was thinking is there a hunter, a sniper kind of character, hiding in the trees, maybe shooting from a covered position? "I was thinking to myself, I wonder if this is going to be painful when I get shot?" Mr Martin tried to call the emergency services but could not get a signal. After checking on the little girl he went for help. No culprit has been found and French police admit they have no evidence as to who the hitman and his accomplices were. But Panorama has tracked down a witness who suggests the killer was not acting alone. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting has never spoken publicly before. He drove me along the same route but does not want to be identified for fear of the killer still at large. "When I arrived there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here," he said. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." He also saw a British car driven by someone who seems to have been an accomplice. "He arrived on the left and he passed really quickly. The car was a BMW 4x4, X5, grey metallic, in good condition. "It was a right hand drive, English. I didn't get much of a look at him but the driver was slightly bald and he had dark skin, no glasses." Ten minutes later, two of his colleagues driving down the same road saw the motorbike up the hill from the parking area beyond where motor vehicles were not allowed to go. "They told me they passed the motorbike I had passed at Place Martinet - two bends further up. "They had words with him because motor vehicles aren't allowed. So they called out to him and asked him to drive down. They saw his face because he lifted his helmet...he had a bit of a beard." This seems to suggest that at least two people acted together - one carrying out surveillance, the other the hitman. The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said there is no evidence as to who the hitman or his accomplices were. In less than a minute, 21 bullets were fired with great accuracy, leading investigators to wonder whether the attack was a contract killing carried out by someone in the criminal underworld. French police have traced all the vehicles in the area that day except two - the motorbike and the grey four-by-four. They are still searching for them. The terrible events he witnessed have not stopped Brett Martin from riding his bike up the same road when he visits his holiday home. But the events of that day will always be with him. "It's a mystery. Perplexing, unsolved, [it's] one of those Agatha Christie 'whodunit' scenarios."

      <description>The peril facing Britain's woodlands from foreign pests</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <title>Defence chief admits huge challenges</title>
      <description>Britain's new top general on the future of the armed forces</description>

      <body>The new Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Nick Houghton, says he has taken over at a time of "huge challenges". The UK's most senior military officer told the BBC the armed forces had shown great resilience in recent years. But Gen Houghton said it was too soon to judge the recruitment levels to the reserves, which are running at around half the planned levels. He is responsible for implementing cuts to the Army, while ensuring the Afghanistan withdrawal goes smoothly. UK troops are continuing to fight a campaign in Afghanistan, while preparing to withdraw - at the same time as reducing the number of regulars by 20,000 and bringing back troops based in Germany. Gen Houghton, an Oxford University history graduate and former Green Howard, is now the nation's most senior military officer and professional head of the armed forces. He is responsible for implementing the many simultaneous changes flowing from the Strategic Defence Review in 2010. The review cut 8% from the MoD's already stretched budget. In his first broadcast interview, Gen Houghton said: "If you just look at what the Army is being asked to do in terms of continuing to fight a campaign, to withdraw and downscale its numbers by 20,000 regulars, to bring 20,000 of its people back from Germany, to restructure, to build up the strength of the reserves, and during all this, take other things like public duties and Olympic security in its stride, yes, these are huge challenges." So what impact is this having on the armed forces, particularly on morale? "In terms of morale, it's not about individual happiness," he said. "It is about the ability to endure in times of real austerity, endure through times of hostility, in times of pressure. "And I think if anything has demonstrated the resilience of the morale of the British armed forces, it is the last couple of years - and the fact they still continue to perform, and are one of our nation's unique selling points." One of the tasks at the top of the agenda is the plan to continue cutting regulars in the Army to 82,000 from 102,000, while trying to increase the number of reservists from 19,000 to 30,000. Last week, MPs passed a motion that noted concerns about the government's defence reforms "in relation to whether its proposals for the reserve forces will deliver either the anticipated cost savings or defence capability". So with the current recruitment of reservists lagging well behind target, would he advise the government to think again? Gen Houghton said: "Well, I think this is more an argument in Parliament than it is one within the armed forces. "You can't compare these 82,000 regulars of the 21st Century with Victorian figures. These are 82,000 regulars, the vast percentage of which are deployable capability, not mess waiters or guards. "It's a force that's networked by modern communications. Private soldiers are connected to close air support and artillery fires. The capability of soldiers nowadays are transformed from what they were even a decade ago". "But of course, size is important, and that is why the reserves provide an essential and cost-effective mechanism of maintaining resilience." On the level of reservist recruitment so far, Gen Houghton insists it is too early to make a judgement. "We think that we have produced a good offer. We've got to get out the message that people who join now are joining something that is exciting, will give them all sorts of rewards and has a very, very strong future." However, after the Parliamentary vote on Syria that rejected UK military action, how does he see their role today? "Well, I think the message is that we've got to be quite hard-nosed about defining what the core national interest is when we want to use our armed forces, and the utility of doing so." That does not rule out military action abroad, but it may well be of a rather different sort from Iraq and Afghanistan. "We want to influence, to use our unique access in all sorts of countries to build capacity, to stabilise, and prevent conflict," Gen Houghton explains, "as well as being the 'go-to' organisation for domestic crisis, whether it's fire strikes, foot and mouth, or Olympic security." First, though, British combat forces must perform an orderly exit from Afghanistan by the end of next year after 12 years and 445 British lives lost. What is his verdict? "You've got to really take a strategic look," Gen Houghton said. "The United Kingdom has been part of an international effort to maintain the integrity of Afghanistan, to give that country the chance of looking after its own security, having a democratic process that elects the next president, that has the prospect of some prosperity and has not been the source of international terrorism. So I would deem that success." </body>

      <body>Ouch asked its Twitter followers for disability and health acronyms, after a member of the team learned a new one - Tatt - at the doctor's surgery. Many disabilities get condensed into strings of two, three or four letters, because their full medical names are long and cumbersome. Cerebral palsy becomes CP, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is shortened to EDS and BPD is borderline personality disorder, to name but three. These names are often difficult to say, and the conditions themselves difficult to explain to strangers. Nor are the acronyms very enlightening. @EclipseNQ has a quirky solution to this. He tells people that he has HTE, which of course leads to the follow-up question: "What's that?" "I say it's Hard To Explain. Nobody gets it." And @Sectioned_ tells us there are many acronyms for mental health services that look like alphabet soup and which can throw up confusing results in search engines. CMHT = Community Mental Health Team "but also the College of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism". The AMHP is Approved Mental Health Professional "but also the Association of Major Holiday Parks". While these are probably unwitting duplicates, London Underground has knowingly repurposed one of the world's most common acronyms to describe some of its disabled customers. In Tube stations, VIPs aren't Very Important but Visually Impaired People. With this in mind, can you guess what MIP stands for? Finally, for those of you holding your breath to find out what Tatt means, it stands for Tired All The Time.

      <description>Ten reasons to take notice of the Rugby League World Cup</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/24481185</url>

      <body>The Rugby League World Cup begins on 26 October, with 14 teams taking part in the tournament across the UK, Ireland and France. Though the international game is traditionally dominated by Australia, New Zealand and England - where it is sometimes seen as a sport for the M62 corridor and little more - the World Cup is an opportunity for rugby league to reach beyond its core demographic. From defying fascism to Fijians in Rochdale, expensive players to cheap tickets, BBC Sport gives you 10 reasons to take notice. Perhaps the biggest cross-code star in rugby, New Zealand second-rower Sonny Bill Williams could swell World Cup gates just by showing up. A headline-grabber on and off the pitch, Williams helped Sydney Roosters win the National Rugby League (NRL) title in his first season back in league after completing a five-year ban for walking out on Canterbury Bulldogs. In his time away, the 28-year-old played union in France, Japan and his native New Zealand, as well as helping the All Blacks win the World Cup in 2011. A return to union looks on the cards and seemed certain when he made himself unavailable for the tournament because of "other commitments", only for a change of heart 24 hours later and the subsequent confirmation that he will stay in league for a year at least. Now, the man who is also New Zealand's heavyweight boxing champion  (six wins from six fights) has the chance to fill the only gap on his CV, having missed out when the Kiwis triumphed in 2008. Little-known outside of rugby league circles in the UK, Sam Burgess and his twin brothers George and Tom are celebrities in Australia, especially league-loving Sydney. All three - along with a fourth Burgess brother, Luke - play for NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sam having been persuaded to move down under in 2009 by Souths owner Russell Crowe.  Crowe's treatment of Sam - before his Souths debut, Sam was presented with a Rabbitohs membership card for his late father Mark - led to the other three Burgess boys following and, earlier this year, they became the first quartet of brothers since 1910 to play for an Australian top-flight side in the same game. With mum Julie also having moved to Sydney, the only disappointment for the Burgess family came when Luke missed out on a place in the England squad for the World Cup. On top of all that, Sam has developed something of a rivalry with Sonny Bill Williams. Just after Williams took to the field for his league return, Burgess powered through Williams's attempted tackle, a steamrollering that has since been watched more than 300,000 times on YouTube.  Will the two lock horns once more during the World Cup? The Rugby League World Cup will be something of a farewell tour - for now, at least - for England full-back Sam Tomkins, who is joining NRL side New Zealand Warriors. A world-record fee was paid to prise Tomkins away from Wigan, a sum in excess of the £450,00 paid by the Super League champions for Bradford's Stuart Fielden in 2006. Intelligent, twinkle-toed and blessed with a touch of genius, Tomkins - the 2012 Super League Man of Steel - is England's all-time leading try-scorer. Wigan have the first option on Tomkins should he decide to leave his new side, but with the possibility of the 24-year-old following brother Joel into union in the future, opportunities to see him play league in England are now at a premium. With 28 games scheduled for 21 venues  across England, Wales, Ireland and France, the Rugby League World Cup is nothing if not accessible. While most of the stadiums used are around rugby league's traditional M62 heartland, the tournament also finds its way to union strongholds Neath, Bristol, Limerick and Cardiff, where the Millennium Stadium hosts the opening double-header when England face Australia and Wales take on Italy. Prices are reasonable too, with 55% of tickets costing £20 or less  and six grounds offering buy one, get one half-price deals. But the best deal may be reserved for the semi-finals at Wembley, with both games played on 23 November and tickets starting at £20. Pickles the dog earned a place in football history for discovering the Jules Rimet Trophy a week after it was stolen in March 1966 - but that story pales in comparison to the mystery surrounding the Rugby League World Cup trophy.  Commissioned for the inaugural tournament in France in 1954 at a cost of eight million Francs, the trophy was used until 1970, when the holders, Australia, put it on display in the Midland Hotel in Bradford. Stolen six days before the final, it would not be seen again for 20 years. In 1990, it was found on a rubbish dump in the city by Stephen Uttley, who eventually identified it with the help of a local newspaper. When the trophy was returned to Rugby Football League headquarters in Leeds, an official said: "It is like the return of the Holy Grail. No-one knows what its value is, but in rugby league terms it is priceless." Fiji's game with Ireland at Rochdale's Spotland on 28 October may seem to have little significance aside from the fact it is both sides's opening game in Group A, but it may provide the most raucous atmosphere of the entire tournament. Thanks to Joe Levula and Orisi Dawai, recruited by Rochdale Hornets  in 1961, Rochdale has the UK's biggest Fijian population outside of London. The affection shown to Levula and Dawai by Hornets fans was reciprocated, with Rochdale becoming imprinted on the minds of Fijians 10,000 miles away. Fijians recruited to the British Army would travel to Rochdale, and the resulting community would eventually boost the Greater Manchester town's bid to host the tournament. Rochdale will go even more Fijian for the Ireland game - special menus will be served in pubs, a Fiji Celebration Day will be held and hotels are sold out. The Irish should expect a partisan crowd. Describing rugby league as the toughest sport in the world is a big claim, but there is science to back it up. International rugby league players lose more playing time through injury  than any other sport - 220 hours per 1,000 compared to 112 in American Football, 80 in ice hockey, 40 in football and 10 in cricket. In a tackle, a rugby league player feels a force of over 10G, the same as a car crash. If that doesn't convince you, consider some of the injuries suffered at the top level. Harlequins full-back Ben Jones-Bishop once played 25 minutes against Wigan with a cracked skull, Great Britain's Paul Deacon fractured the roof of his mouth in a 2005 international against New Zealand and Warrington Wolves prop Paul Wood played on with a ruptured testicle, subsequently having it removed. These boys are hard as nails. In the run-up to World War II, rugby league was on an unstoppable rise in France - 225 clubs had been established in five years. Seen as modern, innovative and linked to the pre-war left-wing government, it was banned by the Vichy regime - the puppets of Nazi Germany - after some lobbying from French rugby union, itself in decline. The French had been pushing for a World Cup since 1935 and the dream was realised by Paul Barriere, a former union player who met league leaders when part of the French resistance. Barriere worked to restore league in France following the war and, in 1951, proposed a World Cup, with the idea being adopted at a meeting in Blackpool in 1953. The inaugural tournament was held in France in 1954, with the hosts narrowly beaten by Great Britain in the final. After hosting once more in 1972 and sharing duties with the UK in 2000, France again welcomes two games in the 2013 tournament. For 25 years, the Rugby League World Cup was a showcase of Australia's dominance. Six consecutive titles gave them nine out of 12 overall. But that run came to a halt in the 2008 final with a 34-20 defeat by New Zealand in the Aussies's Brisbane backyard. Now, the Kangaroos travel north to regain what they see as their property, spearheaded by the trio of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and Billy Slater. Named in the top four players in the NRL  by the Sydney Morning Herald, each man has also won the Golden Boot Award - given to the player voted the best in the world - in the past six years. Smith, the captain, is a formidable presence at hooker, Slater has scored more tries than any other full-back in NRL history and creative half-back Thurston was the leading points scorer five years ago. While the Rugby League World Cup has been an almost exclusive preserve of Australia success, their 2008 failure was proof that the tournament is not a closed shop. New Zealand, boosted by the inclusion of Williams, travel with hope of defending their title, while co-hosts England, perhaps with the benefit of a post-Olympic bounce, are genuine contenders, despite the shock warm-up defeat by Italy. It would be a surprise if the world's leading trio do not fill three of the four semi-final spots, with the last slot up for grabs to the rest of a field that could use unfancied Fiji's run to the last four in 2008 as inspiration. The unorthodox format  is an attempt to keep one-sided contests to a minimum, a theory that was largely successful five years ago - the majority of lower-ranked nations will not have to meet the big boys until the knockout stage. 35 days. 28 games. 21 venues. 14 teams. One team crowned rugby league world champions. Bring it on. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: The Voice winner Andrea Begley</title>
      <description>Voice winner Andrea Begley on her chart ambitions and more</description>

      <body>Andrea Begley only won the second series of The Voice in June, but her album is already finished. The 27-year-old says she wants to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor, Leanne Mitchell - who waited a year to release an album, only to see it stall at number 134 in the UK charts. The time constraints mean Begley's debut mostly consists of cover versions, with Bruce Springsteen's Dancing In The Dark and Jake Bugg's Lightning Bolt among the songs to receive an acoustic makeover. But Begley also sings two original songs, including the title track, The Message. The former law student, who has only 10% vision, talked to the BBC about recording her vocals "line by line"; will.i.am's protest at her victory on The Voice (he tweeted he was "sad" and "perplexed"); and how she would change the show next year. Has it been a rush to get your album ready? Obviously, we couldn't plan for what happened beyond the show, because nobody knew what the result was going to be - but I always had ideas in my head about things I'd like to do if I ever did an album. So we started with that kind of blank page and went from there. What we tried to do was get some stuff from the show, and also do covers of songs I have loved over the years. We knew it was important to get out an album before Christmas. Why was that? From the point of view of what happened last year: Everyone knows things didn't go quite as well as they might have done. Leaving the winner's album for so long, it didn't keep the momentum. For me, it was important to make a good job of it, but not take so long that people had forgotten about me. Do you think you got the balance right? Hopefully! I think the album captures different sides of me as an artist. Within the show I only really got to show a certain angle. What do you mean by that? I suppose what I mean is you've only got a certain number of performances, and you've got a time limit as well. I guess, for me, beyond the show it's great to show I can sing all kinds of things. How long was the time limit? It's quite short. One of them was 1 minute 10 seconds. You find ways and means around it. It's all in the edit - picking out the bits people like to listen to. But there's no doubt about it, you are under a constraint. It's nice to have the luxury of doing a full song on the album! Your audition song (Sarah McLachlan's Angel) is on the album. How far in advance did you decide to perform it on the show? Pretty much from the get-go. As soon as I met the production team, I said: 'This is the kind of song I'd like to do. It isn't too over-played, it isn't too well-known, but it suits my style and I can sing it very well.' I very much nailed my colours to the mast with that song - and it bore out in the end. It really worked. A lot of people, including will.i.am, said they were disappointed you beat Leah McFall. How did that make you feel? Music is subjective and everyone has their own opinion. You'll always get people who'll prefer my music to what Leah or Will are into. The thing is, I love all kinds of music. I love the stuff that Will does, so it was never case of me versus them. Will's tweet is very much in the past. He spoke to me afterwards and said 'look, it's just because I wanted my act to win, and I would have supported you if you'd been my act'. Some people suggested you won because you're visually impaired. Was that a shock? It's a little bit disappointing, I guess, if people go down the route of saying I only won because I had a story. That's not giving the public the credit it's due. People don't vote for those reasons - it's a singing show, at the end of the day, and I was there on the same basis as everyone else. I never, ever tried to make out that I was there because I was visually impaired. Did your law degree come in handy when you were reading your recording contract? [Laughs] It's always helpful, in the sense that it keeps your wits about you. But my experience was a long way off the world of showbusiness. How does singing in the studio compare to live performances? It's very different. Studio days are tiring because you're standing in front of a microphone for hours on end. People don't realise how meticulous it is. You record everything line by line by line by line. But then, when you hear it back, you realise how much you need to focus on each individual part to get it right. Your aunt is country singer Philomena Begley. Did she give you any tips? I've had quite a lot of contact with my aunt in the past couple of months, and she's been keeping me advised of songs, and things I should watch out for. She's very excited about the album coming out. There's a little bit of country on it, so she'll be happy with that. What did she tell you to watch out for? Just to make sure I get my opinions across. I'm always pretty determined anyway, and I speak my mind. So I definitely did that. What was the biggest argument you had? Did you have to pull a diva strop? Not yet - but I'm working on it. I want a newborn kitten in every dressing room! You played a concert with Evelyn Glennie for people with sensory disabilities in over the summer. What was that like? It was done in conjunction with the RNIB and Action for Hearing Loss. My set was made accessible to people with hearing loss by having sign interpreters there, so I just had to make sure I stuck to the set list and did all the lyrics in the correct order! It's easy to assume that people with hearing loss wouldn't get anything from a concert, but I guess there's a visceral, physical element to live music. Of course, and obviously you've got all the visual aspects of watching the band. If you've got some level of hearing, you can pick up some of the concert and enjoy it. It's the same for me if I go to see a film. I won't necessarily get all the visuals, but it's still an experience - going out to the cinema and the big screen, and all that. Has going to the cinema become more accessible with things like audio description? It's definitely improving, although audio description is nowhere near the level I think it should be. Someone asked me recently what I felt was the single biggest problem for people with visual impairment. From my point of view, I'd like to get people to understand what visual impairment is, so that if they come across someone with a stick or a dog, that they know not to freak out or ask silly questions. Does that happen a lot? I run into it very rarely, but you do get it sometimes. People have come up and shouted loudly at me. They must have thought my ears didn't work, as well as my eyes! Finally - what do you think of the new line-up on The Voice? I'm excited. It's good to give it a fresh look. I know some people think Danny and Jessie leaving might be a little too much disruption. But the new setting will keep viewers' interest alive. Everybody wants to see what kind of banter there'll be between the new coaches. If you were auditioning this year, whose team would you want to be on? I don't know! Possibly Tom, or Kylie. I think will.i.am's going to have a lot of competition from her. She has a sparkle and personality that'll be really good for the show. And if they put you in charge, what would you change? For me, definitely, the knock-out rounds were absolutely horrendous. So I'd make them do two knock-out rounds, just to be a little bit devious. You'd make it harder! I'd just like to fully test them. See if they're up to the challenge. Andrea Begley's album, The Message, is out on Monday, 21 October. </body>

      <body>Plans for the UK's first nuclear plant in two decades generate headlines in Monday's newspapers. It is the lead story in the Guardian, which describes the deal as Britain's "nuclear rebirth". But it says the guaranteed subsidies promised by the government for Hinkley Point C in Somerset will lead to accusations that ministers are loading a further cost on spiralling energy prices. According to the Times, experts say it is a subsidy which could add about £8 a year to average bills when the power station begins operating. The Daily Mirror says households are set to be "clobbered" on the back of the "nuclear bombshell". Meanwhile, the papers find irony in the French and Chinese involvement as investors to build the plant. The Financial Times remarks that a country that won the race to harness atomic power for peaceful uses is having to rely on French technology and Chinese money to revive its programme. Or as the Daily Telegraph puts it, nearly 60 years after the Queen opened the world's first nuclear power station, we find ourselves relying on a communist superpower to keep the lights on. An interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury makes the Daily Telegraph's main story. Justin Welby tells the paper that a strong economy is "necessary, but not sufficient" to solve Britain's problems. Creating a more caring society is just as important, he says. The Daily Mail leads with the survey by Tesco showing how much of its produce ends up in the bin. The paper says experts blame our throwaway culture for the colossal waste, as well as misleading sell-by dates and offers. According to the Independent's main story, a legal loophole lets companies receiving government contracts to provide care for tens of thousands of vulnerable people avoid millions of pounds in tax. Nick Clegg's change of heart on free schools gets him into trouble with the leader writers. In the Daily Mirror's view, the deputy prime minister has a nerve to suddenly voice criticism of the schools after he voted for them. The Daily Mail accuses him of cynical opportunism and playing cheap political games with children's education. But according to the Daily Telegraph, his views will doubtless play well with the critics of free schools in his own party and beyond. Addressing Mr Clegg's concern that free schools are allowed to recruit unqualified teachers, the Sun notes the best private schools do not worry about jobsworth restrictions, they look for people with a vocation for teaching. The housing market is bursting into life, the Daily Express says as it reports figures showing that prices in the past four weeks have soared by an average of £7,000. The rise puts the price of a typical three-bedroom semi at more than £250,000. Finally, you won't be able to miss the actress Emma Thompson. She is on many front and inside pages including the Times and the Guardian after her appearance on the red carpet in Leicester Square for the premiere of her new film, Saving Mr Banks. She stars as PL Travers, the creator of Mary Poppins' books, alongside Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Borrowing a line from Mary Poppins herself, the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail both describe Thompson's role as "practically perfect in every way". </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <title>Co-op Group to lose control of Co-op Bank</title>
      <description>Co-op Group's hopes of retaining control of Co-op Bank after its rescue have been dashed by opposition from creditors, led by hedge funds.</description>

      <body>Co-op Group's hopes of retaining control of Co-op Bank after its £1.5bn rescue have been dashed by opposition from creditors, led by a duo of hedge funds, I understand. But Co-op Group hopes the bank's co-operative ethos can be protected. Co-op Bank is also expected to announce later today that its provisions for the costs of compensating customers for mis-selling PPI insurance or for flaws in lending documentation, inter alia, will be around £100m greater than it expected. Or to put it another way, a bank that has taken itself to the brink of collapse because of the scale of losses, from loans going bad and an expensive IT project that had to be written off, turns out to be even more loss making than was thought. However I am told that the banks' supervisor, the Prudential Regulation Authority, has concluded that the amount of new capital needed by Co-op Bank to remain viable does not need to be increased from the £1.5bn agreed in the summer. So the challenge for Co-op Bank of staying alive remains what it was (and see what I wrote here a couple of days ago for more on this). However, after a weekend of intensive talks with Co-op Bank's creditors, Co-op Group, owner of Co-op Bank, has conceded - or so I am told - that its own plan for rescuing the bank has to be torn up and replaced. Co-op Group's original plan involved it putting in £1bn of the capital needed by Co-op Bank, with bondholders and owners of preference shares contributing the remaining £500m. Under this proposal, Co-op Bank would have been floated on the London Stock Exchange, but Co-op Group would have retained control of it with a 70% stake. This deal cannot go ahead without the agreement of the bondholders and owners of preference shares, and they've told Co-op Group they reject it. The most important opposition to what Co-op Group wanted came from owners of 43% of "lower-tier-two-capital" bonds - or lenders to the bank with greater rights over Co-op Bank's assets than other bondholders. The leaders of these opponents were a couple of hedge funds, Silver Point and Aurelius, advised by investment bank Moelis. These hedge funds favoured a plan in which their bonds would be converted largely into Co-op Bank shares, which would give the bondholders ownership and control of the bank. Under this alternative rescue, the banks would still be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The hedge funds are getting their way. Under a revised rescue plan, it is the bondholders - which also include insurers and pension funds - which would end up controlling Co-op Bank. At the time of writing, that revised plan has not been formally agreed. But I am told it is likely to be finalised over the coming week - with an announcement on the detail likely next Monday. Under any new rescue deal, Co-op Group would retain a stake, but it would be less than the 50% necessary for Co-op Group to boss the bank. Institutional investors, led by hedge funds, would collectively be the majority owners. This conversion of Co-op Bank into just another bank owned by professional investors has the potential to fundamentally alter the bank's ethos and culture, I am told that the hedge funds recognise that such perceived cultural change would be a bad thing, because they see there would be a risk of Co-op Bank being deserted by hundreds of thousands of customers who choose it because they see it as a more ethical bank than the others. So as part of any rescue, the bank's co-operative and ethical underpinnings are expected to be written into the bank's governing principles. Meanwhile it is hoped that the structure of the new deal will placate another group unhappy with Co-op Group's original proposals, namely thousands of individuals who invested in the bank's preference shares and perpetual subordinated bonds. Under the Co-op Group's rescue plan, holders of these perpetual subordinated bonds and preference shares would have received ordinary shares in the new bank in exchange for their bonds and preference shares - because that was the conventional way of forcing a financial sacrifice on investors very low down the food chain of creditors (the perpetual subordinated bonds and preference shares have less claim on Co-op Bank's assets than the lower-tier-2-capital holders). This would have caused considerable hardship for many of these individuals, because their existing Co-op Bank investments pay a handsome income, whereas the new Co-op Bank shares would probably pay little or no income for many years. So there has been a public campaign against what Co-op Group was proposing by these small investors, co-ordinated by Mark Taber. Co-op Group has been insisting it has been trying to protect the interests of the retail investors. And it looks as though they have won some kind of victory, because the revised rescue deal will - breaking with convention - offer them income-paying bonds. Meanwhile the hedge funds and lower-tier-2-capital owners will receive mainly shares, because they want direct ownership of a bank that they believe can be restored to health and turned into a valuable business over three to five years. The hedge funds and other institutional investors are also expected to invest tens of millions of pounds of their own money in Co-op Bank, to boost its capital and reinforce their control of the bank. As I wrote on Friday, however, if no rescue can be agreed voluntarily, control of the bank would temporarily be seized by the Bank of England, under a process called resolution. The Bank would then protect the interests of depositors by forcing big losses on Co-op Group and obliging the bank's bondholders to convert their loans to the bank into loss-absorbing shares on terms regarded by the Bank of England as fair. </body>

      <title>Greenspan fears more debt deadlock</title>
      <description>Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan tells the BBC that the US debt ceiling crisis is far from over, that the eurozone needs political union, and "crony capitalism" is growing.</description>

      <body>Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that a repeat of the crisis that brought the country close to default is "perfectly conceivable". He told the BBC that he had not seen another situation in Washington where "compromise" seemed so far away. Mr Greenspan confessed to sympathies with the aims of the Tea Party, the Republican faction that fought the government during debt ceiling talks. But the former central banker said the movement's tactics were "undemocratic". Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over. The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees "consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going". He said: "The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. "The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be." But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy. "What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would," Mr Greenspan said. "As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected." Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market. He said: "One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010." There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said. He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. "I was very worried about what the impact would be." Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing "crony capitalism" in the US. He said: "Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which… public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours." He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: "I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction." On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative. "One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. "There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. "Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means. "What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is that… unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down," Mr Greenspan said. Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not "think outside of the box" enough. </body>

      <body>Merlin Entertainments, the UK company that owns Legoland, Madame Tussauds and Chessington World of Adventures, says it plans to issue shares to the public. Merlin operates 99 attractions in 22 countries, and has 54 million visitors to its parks a year. It says it is the second-largest company of its kind in the world after Walt Disney. Its other well-known attractions include Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Warwick Castle. The business has a turnover of £1bn a year and is thought to be worth some £3bn.

Shareholders will also get a one-off 30% discount on certain entry passes for Merlin's theme parks. The company, which was formed in 1999, says the number of visitors to its parks has grown by 11% a year since 2008. The company's non-executive chairman, Sir John Sunderland, said: "I have been impressed by the significant growth that Merlin has delivered as a private company. "But there is more to come and I believe Merlin has a very promising future as a publicly listed company." </body>

      <description>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos.</description>

      <body>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos. The firm said that, by Sunday, it had received about 300 positive returns out of a workforce of 1,350. But the Unite union said it had been given more than 500 forms rejecting the offer on pay and pensions. The union has asked its 1,100 members at Grangemouth not to hand the forms to Ineos. It has accused the company of giving workers an ultimatum of accepting worse pay and conditions or losing their job. The 2.6 square-mile refinery and petrochemical site was shut down ahead of a planned strike by Unite members. It remains closed despite the 48-hour strike, which had been due to begin on Sunday, being called off. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. Calum MacLean, chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the company had received "around 300" forms by Sunday. Mr MacLean said he expected most of the returns to come in on Monday, and he "remained pretty confident" there would be strong support for the company from workers. He added: "Getting the plant back up and running again is not about necessarily the number of people, albeit that will influence when we can start it. "What is important here is that we have asked the unions to give us an assurance that there will be no strike action during the consultation period, which is the 45 to 60 days when we are going to sit down and negotiate with the employees and talk about the changes we are trying to impose. "People need to realise that this site has lost £150m per year for the last four years. It has got a pension fund which is £200m in deficit and it is on the point of going bust. "If it wasn't because of the support of the shareholders, who are funding those losses, then there is a very, very serious situation here which means the site may not start up again". Ineos has put forward what it calls a survival plan for Grangemouth and warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. These changes were detailed in letters sent to staff at the end of last week. They include freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support its survival plan at this stage will receive a transitional payment of up to £15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Unite said it had strongly advised its members at Grangemouth not to return the forms backing the changes to their contract. It accused Ineos of "bribes and blackmail". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, told Good Morning Scotland: "We have continuously given assurances of no strikes from now up until December. "In fact yesterday (Sunday), when we had a rally here, I gave a commitment that we would have no strikes for however long it took to allow negotiations to take place between ourselves and Ineos on the survival plan. We are not imposing any conditions. "Ineos wants to come to the negotiating table at the same time as threatening our members and threatening people here with the sack in 45 days. You can't negotiate and impose at the same time." Mr Rafferty said he expected the majority of workers have would reject the new pay and conditions. First Minister Alex Salmond repeated his calls for Ineos to "fire up the plant" and for Unite to commit to a "no strike - without strings - guarantee" at the SNP conference in Perth. Ineos shareholders are due to discuss the future of the complex on Tuesday. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who is scheduled to meet with Ineos later this week, urged the company to "withdraw the ultimatums delivered to the workforce". She said: "The company should also undertake to immediately reopen the plant and return to production and both the union and the company should return to meaningful talks, with Acas if necessary, to deliver a solution to this matter which has serious consequences for Scotland and the UK." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <title>AT&amp;T agrees $4.85bn tower deal</title>
      <description>US telecom giant AT&amp;T has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International.</description>

      <body>US telecom giant ATandT has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International. ATandT will receive nearly $4.85bn (£3bn) in cash upfront as part of the deal. The deal gives ATandT cash to fund a new share buyback announced earlier this year, as well as a multi-billion dollar plan to upgrade its wireless and high-speed internet networks. It has also hinted that it is looking at making acquisitions in Europe. "This deal will let us monetise our towers while giving us the ability to add capacity as we need it," Bill Hogg, a senior vice-president with ATandT said in a statement. "And we'll get additional financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders." The deal is the latest such move by a US telecom operator. Last year, T-Mobile USA agreed to sell the rights to operate 7,200 cellular towers to Crown Castle for $2.4bn. Mobile operators can free up cash and focus on more profitable areas of their business by leasing or selling their towers. Meanwhile, specialist operators tend to lease the capacity on the towers to multiple operators in an attempt to maximise their profits. According to the latest deal, ATandT will sublease capacity on the towers from Crown Castle for a minimum of 10 years for $1,900 per month per site, with annual rent increases of 2%. Crown Castle said in a statement that it "will have the right to sublease other available capacity on the towers to additional tenants and believes the ATandT towers have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one additional tenant per tower". It added that nearly half of the towers were "located in the top 50 markets, where we expect the majority of network densification and upgrade activity to occur". Under the terms of the deal, Crown Castle will have exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 9,100 ATandT towers. The average term of the lease rights is about 28 years and Crown Castle will have the option to purchase the leased towers for about $4.2bn as the leases expire. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <title>Japan in 15th straight trade deficit</title>
      <description>Japan posts a trade deficit for the 15th month in a row in September as a weak yen pushes up import costs.</description>

      <body>Japan has posted a trade deficit for the 15th month in a row in September as a weak yen pushed up import costs. The deficit for the month rose to 932bn yen ($9.5bn; £5.8bn), up 64% from a year ago, as imports rose 16.5%. A series of aggressive measures aimed at reviving Japan's economy has resulted in the yen falling nearly 25% against the US dollar since November. While that has helped Japan's exports by making them cheaper, it has also made imports more expensive. However, the growth in exports has not been sufficient enough to offset the higher import bill. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that exports rose 11.5% in September, from a year earlier. Japan's imports have grown at a faster rate than its exports in all but one of the past 11 months. Analysts said that imports have been rising over these months partly due to higher demand for fuel, which has been triggered by the shutdown of all of Japan's nuclear reactors. At the same time, a recovery in Japan's economy is also helping spur domestic demand. Last month, revised data showed that Japan's economy expanded 0.9% in the April-to-June period, from the previous three months. That translates into an annualised growth of 3.8%. Martin Schulz, of Fujitsu Research Institute, said that given these factors "Japan was likely to see a trade deficit for some time to come". "And as long as it is being driven by a recovery in domestic demand, this is not necessarily a negative sign for the overall economy," he added. </body>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <title>30,000 tonnes of Tesco food 'wasted'</title>
      <description>Supermarket giant Tesco reveals it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of the year.</description>

      <body>Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013. Using its own data and industry-wide figures, it also estimated that, across the UK food industry, 68% of salad to be sold in bags was wasted - 35% of it thrown out by customers. And it estimated 40% of apples and 47% of bakery items in the UK were wasted. The retailer is introducing measures to reduce wastage including developing promotions for smaller bags of salad. The latest figures published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) suggested 15 million tonnes of food went to waste in the UK in 2010. Figures for 2012 will be published next month. Publishing its food waste figures for the first time, Tesco said that, in the first six months of this year, its stores and distribution centres generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste. But it said that, where possible, if food could not be sold it was either donated to poverty charity FareShare, converted into animal feed for livestock, or was recycled into renewable fuel. Prime Minister David Cameron recently praised the FareShare charity and, on Monday, his spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing: "There will be widespread concern about levels of food that go to waste and that's why the prime minister has noted the excellent work that FareShare does." Tesco has also given wastage estimates for the 25 best-selling products across the UK food industry as a whole. The figures were based on waste data from Tesco supermarkets, distribution centres, suppliers and producers - combined with Wrap figures on levels of waste in UK homes. It estimated that 24% of grapes were wasted between the vine and the fruit bowl and that a fifth of all bananas were unused - with one-in-10 thrown away by customers. Tesco said it addressing the problem of waste by ending multi-buys on large bags of salad, removing "display until" dates from fresh fruit and vegetables, using smaller cases in stores, and rearranging 600 in-store bakeries to reduce the amount of bread on display. And it said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease. Other measures to tackle the problem would include providing simple tips to customers about storing fruit, Tesco said. It said it would also share tips about how to use leftover bread, adding it was working with grape and banana suppliers to improve delivery times and conditions. Matt Simister, Tesco's commercial director of group food, said there was "no quick-fix single solution" to tackling food waste. "Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin," he said. "We're playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. "Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we'll be reviewing what else we can do." He said Tesco was working with its suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork. Richard Swannell, director of Wrap, said: "We welcome Tesco's approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. "Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so." Investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman, meanwhile, said consumers were being "ripped off" by supermarket promotions - especially those involving fresh food. "What we could say to consumers is 'wise up'," she told the BBC News Channel. "The minute you walk into the supermarket you may be able to get a few bargains but, more likely than not, you'll be nudged into buying stuff you didn't really want or need and it will go in the bin." </body>

In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>Credit union offering 'payday loans'</title>
      <description>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans.</description>

      <body>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans. London Mutual offers people the chance to borrow between £100 and £1,000 at an interest rate of 2% per month. Borrowers do not have to save with the credit union to apply but they must live or work within one of four inner-London boroughs. Other UK credit unions are expected to adopt a similar model next year. The loans are available on the London Mutual Credit Union's CUOK website. Credit unions are currently limited to charging no more than 2% interest per month, so to borrow £400 over a month would cost just £8 in interest. Customers who want the payment on the same day as they apply have to pay an £11 fee. Borrowers must live or work within four London boroughs - Westminster, Camden, Southwark or Lambeth. They also have to undertake a short psychometric test as part of the application process. The five questions ask borrowers if they tend to obey rules and worry about what other people think of them. Lakshman Chandrasekera, London Mutual Credit Union's chief executive, said the test helped them make lending decisions: "We are trying to find out if you are the type of person who will borrow and not care about not paying. It is useful. There's a correlation between what they say and what their payment patterns are." The whole application process can be finished in under 10 minutes. Mr Chandrasekera said that applicants were given a fast service: "Our online payday loan facility is exactly the same as any other payday loan service. People can apply for the loan, get the decision there and then, and then get the money within a couple of hours." However, the cost of borrowing is significantly lower than commercial payday lenders. Many would charge more than £100 to borrow £400 for a month. Mr Chandrasekera said his credit union also makes careful checks to ensure customers will not struggle to repay the loan: "We are doing thorough checks on affordability, so we will make sure this person can afford to pay the loan." Emma took out a loan for £100 with CUOK last month in order to buy her children school uniforms which she has agreed to pay back over a three month period, costing her just £4.04 in interest: "I'd overspent on holiday with the children. We went through what I had coming in and they worked out what I could afford to pay back. I think within 24 hours I had the money. It was very easy, very straightforward." London Mutual admitted that only one in five applicants like Emma can be approved solely on the basis of the online application process. The other four out of five applicants normally then have to speak to someone over the phone to give additional information. But they would still hope to process the application within 24 hours. Michael regularly used payday loan firms until he discovered he could borrow £400 from CUOK: "Payday loan companies are so aggressive. They also charge about 10 times as much as a credit union. I didn't have to stress." Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, says it is important his members speed up their processing of loans but they should still not be too short term: "The sector has just introduced an automated scoring system built on a score card working with the credit reference agencies. We might not be keen on making loans for a 10-day period but we absolutely need to not take 10 days to make a loan." Some industry commentators believe there are strict limits to the extent that credit unions could ever compete with payday lenders. Julian Knight, money editor of the Independent newspaper, says payday lending has grown too big: "They just don't have the scale. The payday lending industry is worth £3bn to £4bn. It would just be a scratch on the surface." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle. When you look at comparators ie on dividend on yield on profitability, I think the price was just about right." </body>

      <title>British Gas Twitter move draws ire</title>
      <description>An attempt by British Gas to engage its customers in a question and answer session on Twitter ended up attracting a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage.</description>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The figures come as mortgage lenders reported another strong month in September, after a summer flurry. LSL said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up rental prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), also published on Friday, showed that mortgage lending for house purchases continued its summer strength. Gross mortgage lending in the UK stood at £16.2bn in September, slightly below lending of £16.4bn in August, but 41% higher than lending of £11.5bn in September last year. "Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years. House prices too have revived but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. However, the annual rise in rental costs was still slower than the general increase in the cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation at 2.7% in September. </body>

      <title>Bank says rate rise unlikely in 2014</title>
      <description>The Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rate rise next year.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in interest rates next year. In a question and answer session on the social network Twitter, he said the UK would need to see sustained growth before rates rose from the 0.5% level. Earlier this week he said that rates could rise in 2014 if conditions were strong enough. Mr Dale is one of the nine people at the Bank that set monetary policy. As might be expected from a central banker, Mr Dale gave little in the way of surprises in his answers on current monetary policy. In its latest minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current record low of 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. Many questioners wanted to know about QE. Asked "is Quantitative Easing a necessary evil? What will be the implications on the UK's macroeconomic objectives?", Mr Dale replied:"QE not evil. Has helped to support economy and protect jobs." Another of the big economic debates in the country is whether or not house prices are rising dangerously high. When asked if he had any concerns that there was a housing bubble, fuelled by the Help to Buy scheme which helps borrowers struggling to raise a deposit, Mr Dale answered: "A healthy housing market is good for economy. But watching carefully for overheating." Twitter's unfiltered nature inevitably draws offbeat comments. Of less importance to UK economy watchers was "do you ever polish the gold 1Kg brick in the museum?" "No need," was the reply, "It stays shiny without out being polished." But questions to Mr Dale answered in the hour-long session were markedly more serious and respectful than the session held by British Gas on Thursday, which was widely hailed as a lesson in how not to engage through social media. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24576773</url>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>
      <date>1381964753</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>
      <date>1381878293</date>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>
      <date>1381707185</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70398000/jpg/_70398329_vw.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan. Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van. "It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home. "I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this." Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months. His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals. Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed. And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area. "I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says. He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes. "It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham. "I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly." In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's". To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate. Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week." To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors". "I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'. "I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman. "What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful. "We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us." But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose. "I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go." Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit. The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum. Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years. But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success. "The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying." Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing. "I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends. "And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck." Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role. "It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says. "The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else." Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive. Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff. "I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that." </body>

      <title>'High demand' for Games tickets sale</title>
      <description>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow sees "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking.</description>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <title>Advisor seeks more Rangers directors</title>
      <description>Two board members is "not suitable" to run Rangers, the football club's advisor, Paul Shackleton, admits.</description>

      <body>Two board members is "not suitable" to run Rangers, the football club's advisor, Paul Shackleton, admits. And he says he is trying to find a suitable compromise between the board and disgruntled shareholders. "I can't go into detail, but I have been speaking with shareholders," said Shackleton, from the club's nominated advisors, Daniel Stewart. "I have been talking to everybody, trying to map out a path through this minefield." Craig Mather this week resigned his post as chief executive, with non-executive board member Bryan Smart also standing down. With non-executive director Ian Hart and chairman Walter Smith having left previously, Rangers International Football Club plc now has only two board members in situ - finance director Brian Stockbridge and non-executive director James Easdale. Those latest departures followed Rangers' being forced to delay their annual general meeting after a group of shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision. The group led by former chairman Malcolm Murray and former director Paul Murray want that pair to be elected to the board along with allies Alex Wilson and Scott Murdoch. Bus tycoon Sandy Easdale, who is on the football club board along with his brother and Stockbridge, subsequently broke his family's silence to say that the "constant tit-for-tat" was damaging the club. "We are actively trying to sort the situation out," said Shackleton. "We are doing everything we can to get it sorted. It needs stability." Shackleton hoped to achieve that after speaking to all sides in the battle for control of the League One club. "Once we have done that, I think we can make a decision," he said. "There needs to be more directors at the club. Two directors are not suitable for the long-term. "But I've not been sitting on my hands. It is a very complicated situation and we are doing what we can to sort it out. "There is a process to go through and I'm trying to come up with ideas. "We are very keen to get it resolved as soon as possible and I think I am making progress." Rangers' recently released annual accounts showed an operating loss of £14m and a new date for the AGM has yet to be announced. </body>

      <body>The International Cricket Council has handed Bangladesh an extension until 30 November to complete work on stadiums for next year's ICC World Twenty20. It had been widely reported  that concerns over facilities might cause the tournament to be moved to another country, such as South Africa. But the ICC board has now approved a request to extend the deadline. The full schedule for the event, due to take place between 16 March and 6 April 2014, will be released on 27 October. The news follows an inspection report by the ICC's venue consultant. The World Twenty20 will feature men's and women's tournaments played in parallel, as has happened at three of the four previous events, and both are set to be the biggest yet - with 16 men's teams rather than 12, and 10 women's teams rather than eight. The two-day ICC board meeting in London also discussed banned Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Amir's plea to resume his career in domestic cricket - opting to review the matter in due course once its revised anti-corruption code has been adopted. Amir, 21, was jailed for six months and banned from cricket for five years for his part in a spot-fixing betting scam in England in 2010. The board also approved the schedule of next year's Under-19 World Cup, to be held in the United Arab Emirates in February and March; approved a recommendation to increase assistance given to Afghanistan by $1.1m (£680,461); and agreed that an ICC chairman will be appointed after next year's annual conference. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Nuclear strike price</title>
      <description>What is the strike price and why is it needed?</description>

      <body>The government has finally agreed a nuclear strike price with French power company EDF. But what is this price and why is it needed? Nuclear what price? No-one is talking about a nuclear strike here - Armageddon is not upon us. The nuclear strike price simply refers to the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced from its proposed new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset. Why do we need a strike price in the first place? Because the government has maintained all along that it will not provide any public subsidies to the nuclear industry. It would not actually be illegal to do so, but the coalition would need permission from the European Union. Any such u-turn would be hugely embarrassing, however, not to mention hugely unpopular. How does the price work in practice? In essence, the government has guaranteed EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour (Mwh), so if the market price of electricity falls below this level, the government has in effect said it will make sure EDF receives the difference between the two prices. The wholesale price of electricity at the moment is about £45/Mwh. If the wholesale price remains at this level, then EDF will receive an additional £47.50/Mwh. In practice, this money will not come from taxpayers (that would count as a subsidy), but from consumers of electricity. The strike price works the other way as well - EDF has to refund the difference if the price of electricity is above £92.50/Mwh. For example, if the wholesale price is £110/Mwh, then it has to refund £18.50/Mwh. Again, this money goes back to bill payers, not to the government. The strike price will fall from £92.50 to £89.50 if EDF agrees to develop another new reactor in Sizewell, Suffolk. This simply reflects the fact that EDF's costs will be lower per reactor if it builds two of them. But why the need for any guaranteed price? Nuclear reactors cost a lot of money, and EDF wants to build two of them. The final bill is estimated at £16bn. Even for a massive company like EDF, this is a huge investment, which makes it inherently risky. For example, if the price of electricity falls, or becomes more volatile, the company could lose a lot of money. And because the plant would take 10 years to build, there is simply too much uncertainty to commit to such a huge investment. For this reason, EDF needs an added incentive to build the reactors. Knowing it will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity generated at Hinkley provides some kind of certainty that the investment will be worthwhile - in other words, profitable. For its part, the government has been unable to play different energy companies off against each other, as German power giants RWE and E.On have decided against building new plants in the UK. It has, therefore, been forced to negotiate with EDF. But this doesn't mean EDF holds all the cards - the company is desperate to get Hinkley Point C started so it can serve as a blueprint for similar power stations across the world. So what does it mean for bills? Until we know the price of electricity on the open market when Hinkley Point C starts generating power, we simply won't know. If the electricity price is below the strike price, then bills will probably go up. If it is above the strike price, then bills could go down. It will also depend on the energy mix at the time, in other words how much of your electricity is generated by nuclear power. At the moment, almost 20% of the UK's power is generated by nuclear reactors, but this is likely to fall in the short term as the UK's current nuclear capacity is decommissioned. This is all very well, but why are we building new nuclear power plants? Precisely because there will be a shortfall in electricity generation as a result of existing nuclear power stations going offline. The question then is how to make up this shortfall. The government is committed to renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, but to get enough generating capacity from these sources will take too long, so another solution is needed. In theory, it could simply increase power generation from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and gas, but stringent, legally-binding CO2 emissions targets mean this is not possible. There is some room for an increase in gas-generated power, but as we import most of this gas, the government has concerns about energy security - it wants us to generate our own power, not rely on others for it. So, in the government's eyes, that leaves nuclear. And it wants EDF to lead by example, paving the way for other power companies to invest in new reactors in the UK, because two new reactors will not be enough. </body>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $4.7bn (£2.9bn) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>How heavily marketed New Zealand apples are winning in UK</description>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was £1.95/kg, Cox £1.75/kg and Pink Lady £3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink Lady® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is room for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Why breaking up is getting harder</title>
      <description>Why breaking up is getting harder</description>

      <body>As Abba once sang so wistfully, breaking up is never easy. But when Benny and the band reflected on the passing memories and the tears, they forgot to mention the practical dilemmas faced by separating couples: how to divide the money, and what to do about the children. And in the last six months sorting out those issues has got even harder. Dozens of centres designed to help couples split up amicably are in danger of closure. Indeed some are already in the process of shutting their doors. The closures are an unintended consequence of cuts to the legal aid system, which the government introduced in April. Since then mediators have seen far fewer couples coming through their doors. In May last year 2,800 couples attended sessions, according to the government. By May this year that had more than halved to 1,200. For most people, mediation is a much less stressful process than going to court. It is also cheaper. The mediator will take it for granted that the couple is splitting up, so his or her job is simply to help divide the financial assets, and arrange access to the children. Lawyers are not involved. "It gets sorted a lot quicker. You both still have your say. And there are no arguments," says 23 year-old Sinead Harris from Guildford in Surrey. She spilt from her partner earlier this year, and needed help with arranging access to her two year-old son. "Going through the courts would have meant more stress and more arguments," she says, "which is not good for a child to be around." So why are fewer people using the service? Since April, most couples no longer qualify for legal aid for divorce or separation. When they did receive legal aid, lawyers would often refer them on to mediators. Now that process no longer happens. "Because there's no legal aid, people don't look at mediation," says Eileen Pereira, of National Family Mediation. "Ours has become a hidden service," she adds. Eight mediation services, including some based in Sussex, Wiltshire, Hertfordshire and Lancashire, have already announced their intention to close. Eileen Pereira believes three or four times that number are also under threat. If the closures continue she worries that many more families will be forced to use lawyers instead. "That means they will be spending more," she says. "But also the emotional impact on the family will be much greater because the families will not be supported through this process." The government, which had hoped the legal aid changes might actually encourage more people to use mediation, has been taken by surprise by the fall-off in demand. Lord McNally, the Families Justice Minister, admitted that it was a "hiccup". "We've noticed the dip," he told the BBC. "We're looking at how we can address the issue, and hope to help them promote more mediation more vigorously in the future," he said. But in the meantime much of the £25m set aside as legal aid for mediation has remained unspent. From April 2014, a new law will require those separating in the courts to at least have tried mediation. The government believes that will re-invigorate demand for the services. National Family Mediation, which represents mediation services around the country, cannot be certain how many services will still be in existence by then. In the meantime the government is doing its best to encourage people to go ahead and find a mediator themselves, without being referred by a lawyer. Couples can go via a Ministry of Justice website to locate a mediator based near them, or via National Family Mediation. Those interested are also being reminded that in many cases legal aid is available. Anyone with income below £31,884 might be eligible, depending on some property-owning criteria as well. In addition the government has produced a video, to give people further advice. When they sang, Knowing me, knowing you, Abba also suggested, "There is nothing we can do." However, that is a sentiment that advocates of mediation might well challenge. Even though some break-ups are inevitable, there are ways in which the practicalities, and the costs, of separation can be made more tolerable. </body>

      <title>Energy bills: Where does my money go?</title>
      <description>Where does my money go?</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged that gas and electricity bills will not go up for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 election. The promise, made in his speech at the party's annual conference, has stoked up a debate over energy prices and their justification. So where exactly does customers' money go and what might be the effect of a price freeze? How much do we pay? The average annual dual-fuel bill - covering gas and electricity - is £1,315 per household. This figure, published by regulator Ofgem in mid-September, is based on the latest assumption of the amount of energy a typical household uses. Bear in mind, this is an average. The amount you pay depends on your energy consumption and the method of payment. It is one of the largest regular bills that a household has to pay, behind mortgage or rent, and council tax. Prices have risen in recent years, and analysts predict another increase in the coming weeks. Do people in other countries pay more or less? As with many aspects of this sector, the answer is not simple. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has had a crack at a comparison, but data for countries including Belgium, Italy and Sweden is unavailable. These figures show that average domestic electricity prices in the UK, including taxes, last year were the fourth lowest among 15 EU countries, and the fourth highest among the G7 group of nations. For gas, domestic prices in the UK in 2012 were the second lowest among the 15 EU counties that were compared, and the third lowest in the G7. Households in the US benefited from the lowest prices for both gas and electricity. How much of my bill ends up as the energy firms' profits? The argument over whether the major energy suppliers' profits are "excessive" is central to this debate. The regulator has been collecting data on these firms' profit margins for the past three years. The latest statistics, from mid-September, show that the average profit margin made on the £1,315 bill is £65. This was £30 higher than September 2011 and September 2012. However, it is worth bearing in mind that this is a snapshot and the figure has been volatile. In some months, the profit margin has risen above £100, whereas in others the margin has been negative. Ofgem says that seasonal factors are key to this volatility. Where does the rest of the money go? By far the biggest chunk of your bill goes on the cost of buying gas and electricity on the wholesale market, or directly from an electricity generator or gas supplier. This, in addition to the costs of running a retail business with billing and sales, accounts for 67% of a gas bill and 58% of an electricity bill, according to Ofgem. But this is where the figures get really complicated. Wholesale gas and electricity is not a single product but a whole series of contracts. Each company's team of traders will be buying energy at different prices, depending on whether this is delivered tomorrow, next month, or even in five years' time. They spread out the purchases of energy to mitigate the risk of volatility when, for example, there is unrest in an oil-producing region. OK, and what else does my bill cover? About 16% of it goes on distribution charges - the cost of the gas pipes and electricity wires that get the energy into your home. The cost of high pressure gas and high voltage transmission networks account for 2% of a gas bill and 4% of an electricity bill. VAT accounts for 5% of each. A bit goes on costs of metering and storing gas. Then, 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. It is these "green" fees that the energy suppliers say have pushed up the cost of a typical bill in recent years. What might be the effect of a price freeze? Some of the energy companies, and those who represent them, argue that the lights could go out if prices cannot be changed for nearly two years. In reality, we will not be plunged into darkness. What they mean is that the decommissioning of coal - and ultimately nuclear - power plants, is going to create a shortfall in energy production in the UK. If they are going to build new power production plants, such as wind farms or power stations, huge amounts of investment are needed. An inability to set prices would affect this long-term strategy. In response, Ed Miliband says that firms have been "overcharging" customers for many years. Consumer groups say a price freeze would be popular, but there would be hurdles in making such a policy work. Can the regulator step in if prices are pushed up ahead of the general election? No, Ofgem has no control of the prices that companies charge their customers. Instead, a supplier might find that it is undercut by other firms if it puts up prices significantly, leading customers to switch. If all firms do the same, this competition argument is weakened. However, Ed Miliband says he would take action if prices went up sharply before the election, if Labour formed the next government. What else might it mean for competition? It could affect new, smaller businesses trying to get into the market. They would be unable to change prices, leading to more volatility in terms of profits. Open4Energy, one of only a handful of new suppliers licensed by Ofgem, has already said that it would pull out of the UK if a price freeze looked like becoming policy. How can I save money on my bill now? There are various ways to save money on your energy bill, if you are a homeowner or a tenant. They include looking for better deals and switching suppliers if needs be, especially if you have been on the same tariff for a long time. Paying by direct debit, and receiving bills online can also reduce costs for those currently paying by cheque every quarter. </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost £16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of £92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to £89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be £800m to £1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be £77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <body>Fire fighters in Australia's New South Wales have worked throughout the day to battle bushfires across the state, amid fears three blazes could merge. New South Wales has been badly hit by bushfires after the hottest September on record. It has declared a state of emergency. Early on Monday, the fire commissioner said three fires near Lithgow could be at risk of joining into one fire front. Officials say conditions will worsen this week, with a peak on Wednesday. NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told a news briefing early on Monday that the State Mine fire was at risk of merging with a fire at Mount Victoria. "Modelling indicates that there's every likelihood under the forecast weather conditions that these two fires, particularly up in the back end of the mountains will merge at some point... there is every likelihood that these two fires will join up," he said. He added that in a "worst-case scenario" the fire could merge with a third fire at Springwood but said: "With the continued success of the fire-fighting effort, let's hope that it doesn't extend all that far eastward." Speaking at the end of the day, he said the fires at Springwood and State Mine were still burning. "Advice back from the Springwood fire area is that the fire... is still very active and is still burning in the valley system," he said. At the State Mine fire, planned back-burning - a controlled burn aimed at managing a fire - had been thwarted "by the forward spread of the main fire front," he said. Remote area teams would be working on Monday night to try to secure the Blackheath community near Mount Victoria, Mr Fitzsimmons said. "It's a very difficult and challenging operation," he said. "They're going down very deep gorges... right down to creek lines." Around 800 personnel from interstate fire departments are expected to arrive on Tuesday to assist in fire-fighting efforts. Dry weather conditions had made firefighting efforts difficult on Monday, Mr Fitzsimmons added. "The challenge is that most of the thunderstorm activity and lightning activity we are seeing is unaccompanied by any moisture." NSW declared a state of emergency on Sunday, allowing emergency services to order mandatory evacuations, and cut gas and power supplies if needed. Caroline Russell from Winmalee, in the Blue Mountains area, told the BBC that people were scared and getting ready to leave. "We're about one or two streets away from the fire. So, it's extremely hot; it's very scary and it's a little bit panicked around here at the moment," she said. "We're packed and ready to go. Everything's ready in the car. We're just waiting on the... response now as to whether we need to evacuate or not." Fire fighting efforts are set to continue this week, with weather conditions expected to be the most challenging this Wednesday, with warm weather and strong winds predicted. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started the State Mine bushfire. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, has also been arrested over the fires, local media say, citing police. One of the fires, at Heatherbrae, led to Newcastle Airport being shut and forced hundreds of people to evacuate, local reports said. With hundreds of houses already destroyed disaster welfare centres have been set up where families can start the planning needed to rebuild their lives, the BBC's Jon Donnison, who is near the community of Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, reports. Most of the fire fighters are volunteers - many look exhausted, and some have even lost their homes, our correspondent adds.

The child, who is about four years old, was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece last week. DNA tests showed that the girl is not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for in Athens by a charity, called The Smile of the Child, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal for information. The Roma couple - a woman aged 40 and a 39-year-old man - are due to appear before judges later on Monday to answer charges of abducting a minor and holding false papers. The Roma community where the girl was found has rallied around the couple, saying they looked after her well. The head of the Roma association in Farsala in central Greece says the pair treated her better than their biological children and that she loved them. The brother of the man claiming to be Maria's father repeated the defence that she had been given to them lawfully after her birth, says the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens. A lawyer representing the Roma couple, Kostas Katsavos, said they were carrying out a search for the girl's mother. He said the couple claim the woman had given Maria to them because she could not look after her own biological daughter. "Our clients' claim is that 'we never abducted this child we just adopted her' in a way that was not legal, that we can confess," said Mr Katsavos. But the couple are suspected by social workers of kidnapping the girl and sending her out to beg, or involving her in a sex ring. Police initially raided the Roma camp to search for drugs and weapons. They noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents, and found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple had registered different numbers of children with different regional family registries. The Greek authorities say the couple were in possession of false papers which suggested the woman had given birth to six children within a 10-month period. When questioned about how they came to have Maria, the couple gave "constantly changing claims", Thessalia Province Police Director Vassilis Halatsis said. Through Interpol, Greece has requested assistance from other European countries. Police decided to appeal internationally as the girl looked as if she might be from northern or eastern Europe. The case has also brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>French outrage over US spying claims</title>
      <description>France summons the US ambassador over claims in Le Monde newspaper that the US routinely spied on millions of phone calls in France.</description>

      <body>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has summoned the US ambassador over newspaper claims that the US spied on millions of phone calls in France. France has labelled such activity between allies as "unacceptable". Le Monde says the data, based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, suggest the US NSA agency monitored businesses and officials as well as terrorism suspects. The intercepts were apparently triggered by certain key words. The paper says the National Security Agency (NSA) spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France in just 30 days between December 10 last year and January 8, 2013. The agency also apparently captured millions of text messages. It was unclear whether the content of the calls and messages was stored, or just the metadata - the details of who is speaking to whom. And the paper did not say whether the operation, codenamed US-985D, was still in progress. Mr Fabius announced that he had summoned the US ambassador to discuss the claims "immediately". Interior Minister Manuel Valls had earlier said the allegations were "shocking", and added: "If an allied country spies on France, this is totally unacceptable." The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says the outrage is largely for public consumption, because the French government has been accused of running its own snooping operation similar to the US. Le Monde reported in July that the French government stores vast amounts of personal data of its citizens on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the DGSE intelligence service. Connections inside France and between France and other countries were all monitored, Le Monde reported. Emails, text messages, telephone and internet browsing records are stored for years, it said. The latest revelations follow claims in the German media that US agents hacked into the email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Edward Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>30,000 tonnes of Tesco food 'wasted'</title>
      <description>Supermarket giant Tesco reveals it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of the year.</description>

      <body>Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed it generated almost 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013. Using its own data and industry-wide figures, it also estimated that, across the UK food industry, 68% of salad to be sold in bags was wasted - 35% of it thrown out by customers. And it estimated 40% of apples and 47% of bakery items in the UK were wasted. The retailer is introducing measures to reduce wastage including developing promotions for smaller bags of salad. The latest figures published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) suggested 15 million tonnes of food went to waste in the UK in 2010. Figures for 2012 will be published next month. Publishing its food waste figures for the first time, Tesco said that, in the first six months of this year, its stores and distribution centres generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste. But it said that, where possible, if food could not be sold it was either donated to poverty charity FareShare, converted into animal feed for livestock, or was recycled into renewable fuel. Prime Minister David Cameron recently praised the FareShare charity and, on Monday, his spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing: "There will be widespread concern about levels of food that go to waste and that's why the prime minister has noted the excellent work that FareShare does." Tesco has also given wastage estimates for the 25 best-selling products across the UK food industry as a whole. The figures were based on waste data from Tesco supermarkets, distribution centres, suppliers and producers - combined with Wrap figures on levels of waste in UK homes. It estimated that 24% of grapes were wasted between the vine and the fruit bowl and that a fifth of all bananas were unused - with one-in-10 thrown away by customers. Tesco said it addressing the problem of waste by ending multi-buys on large bags of salad, removing "display until" dates from fresh fruit and vegetables, using smaller cases in stores, and rearranging 600 in-store bakeries to reduce the amount of bread on display. And it said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease. Other measures to tackle the problem would include providing simple tips to customers about storing fruit, Tesco said. It said it would also share tips about how to use leftover bread, adding it was working with grape and banana suppliers to improve delivery times and conditions. Matt Simister, Tesco's commercial director of group food, said there was "no quick-fix single solution" to tackling food waste. "Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin," he said. "We're playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. "Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we'll be reviewing what else we can do." He said Tesco was working with its suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork. Richard Swannell, director of Wrap, said: "We welcome Tesco's approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. "Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so." Investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman, meanwhile, said consumers were being "ripped off" by supermarket promotions - especially those involving fresh food. "What we could say to consumers is 'wise up'," she told the BBC News Channel. "The minute you walk into the supermarket you may be able to get a few bargains but, more likely than not, you'll be nudged into buying stuff you didn't really want or need and it will go in the bin." </body>

      <title>Kenya CCTV 'shows soldiers looting'</title>
      <description>Security camera footage emerges which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's Westgate mall siege, in which some 67 people died.</description>

      <body>Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall. In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. </body>

      <title>Triple killer gets life sentence</title>
      <description>A convicted killer who murdered a man going to the aid of a neighbour in a Hertfordshire village is jailed for life.</description>

      <body>A triple killer who admitted the fatal stabbing of a man in a Hertfordshire village has been jailed for life. Ian John McLoughlin, 55, pleaded guilty to the murder of Graham Buck, 66, in Little Gaddesden, last July, while he was a day release prisoner. Mr Buck was stabbed when he went to help his neighbour, Francis Cory-Wright, 86, who was being robbed. Sentencing McLoughlin at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Sweeney said he must serve a minimum of 40 years. McLoughlin was on day release from prison where he was serving a life term for the murder of Brighton barman Peter Halls, whom he stabbed multiple times in 1992. He had previously been jailed for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, 49, in 1984, whom he hit over the head with a hammer after a row, before leaving his body in a cupboard. Mr Justice Sweeney said that he was barred from passing a whole life term because of a European judgment that those sentences are in breach of human rights. The court heard McLouglin turned up at Mr Cory-Wright's house claiming to need help setting up a charity supporting elderly ex-offenders. But McLoughlin suddenly grabbed him and demanded to know where he kept his "gold and silver". He tied Mr Cory-Wright to the bed, stuffed silver family heirlooms into a pillowcase and demanded his bank cards and Pin numbers. Father-of-three Mr Buck, who lived two doors away from Mr Cory-Wright, went to help him after hearing shouting in his front garden. McLoughlin told police he was "sorry" for what he did to Mr Buck. He said he was confronted by Mr Buck as he tried to flee Mr Cory-Wright's house, and stabbed him in the neck. Witnesses described seeing Mr Buck with his throat slashed "wide open", prosecutor Ann Evans said. The court heard that Mr Buck's wife, Karen, said her life had been "turned upside down" by her husband's death. Shortly before his murder he had returned from a long weekend in Poland, where he met his baby granddaughter for the first time. Mr Buck was born in London and lived in Surrey and Sussex before moving to Hertfordshire in 1995. Since his retirement he had worked as a non-executive director at Aldwyck Housing Association in Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire. Mr Buck, who was described by his family as a "truly genuine person" had two sons, a daughter and two grandchildren. In July, Det Ch Supt Jeff Hill said: "Mr Buck's actions were totally selfless and illustrate a deep sense of community spirit which deserves recognition and respect." McLoughlin was jailed for 10 years in October 1983 for the manslaughter of Len Delgatty, who lived in Stoke Newington. This sentence was reduced to eight years on appeal. McLoughlin was convicted of the murder of barman Peter Halls, 56, in Brighton in July 1992, who had offered him work. McLoughlin stabbed him in the neck. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 25 years. McLoughlin said he assumed Mr Halls was gay, and thought that he may be expected to sleep with him. Ms Evans said: "The defendant claimed that Mr Halls confessed to liking young boys and... that he took holidays in Morocco for under-age sex." McLoughlin stabbed Mr Halls several times, and in 1992 was jailed for 25 years for murder, serving a total of 21 years behind bars, when he was allowed out on day release. </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <description>Descendants of the founding fathers of football attend a ceremony at Wembley Stadium as a blue plaque is unveiled in their honour.</description>

      <body>Descendants of the founding fathers of football have attended a ceremony at Wembley Stadium as a blue plaque was unveiled in their honour. The families of six of the eight men who drafted the original 13 laws of Association Football were tracked down on behalf of the Football Association. They have travelled from as far away as Washington DC, Chicago and Auckland, as well as Lancashire and London. The event starts a week of celebrations to mark the FA's 150th birthday. The FA said little was known about Ebenezer Morley, Arthur Pember, Charles William Alcock, Francis Maule Campbell, John Forster Alcock, Herbert Thomas Steward, George Twizell Wawn and James Turner, who formed the FA in 1863. Mr Morley, a London solicitor who formed Barnes Football Club in 1862, wrote to popular newspaper Bell's Life suggesting that football should have one set of rules to end disputes about how the game should be played. He said football should follow the example of cricket, whose rules were set by the Marylebone Cricket Club. Mr Morley's letter led to the first meeting between the men at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, where the FA was formed on October 26, 1863. Mr Morley was not represented as his family tree ended upon his death in 1924. However, 16 relatives of six of the other men were expected to attend following a four-month search led by cultural historian Dr Jane Clayton, of the International Football Institute at the University of Central Lancashire. It was also discovered that the family tree of Mr Pember crossed with that of another figure of huge historical and cultural significance, Charles Darwin. In 1925 Mr Pember's great-niece married the evolutionary theorist's grandson, Charles Galton Darwin. Dr Clayton said: "For the search to have been so successful is incredibly pleasing as, from a historical perspective, we now know a lot more about a number of the men that created the most popular sport in the world 150 years ago." Alex Horne, general secretary of the FA, said: "In terms of historical significance, the eight founding fathers of football should be placed alongside other great pioneers of this nation. "The game has become a focal point of the lives of nearly every household in England since it was formed, so to now understand more about the history of these men is incredibly important." </body>

      <body>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Manchester United are still involved in the Premier League title race. The Gunners are top of the table, eight points clear of the reigning champions, who have endured their worst league start in 24 years and lie eighth in the standings. "Are Man United out of the title race? No, but of course 10 points starts to be a little gap," said Wenger. "They have big players, big experience and they are a big club." A late goal from Southampton's Adam Lallana denied United victory at Old Trafford on Saturday, with the south-coast club sitting sixth and holding a four-point advantage over David Moyes's side. In contrast, Arsenal's resounding 4-1 win over Norwich at the Emirates maintained their two-point advantage at the top of the league and extended their unbeaten run since their opening day defeat to Aston Villa. "If you have the choice, you want to be in the race at the top, but you cannot rule Man United out today," added Wenger. "It is too early." The Frenchman, whose side overturned United's 12-point lead to win the title in 1998, added that eight points can be retrieved quickly. "It is three games," said Wenger. "That is very quick in our league." Scrutiny of United's form has been intense since Moyes became manager following the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since a 4-1 opening day win at Swansea, his side have only beaten the league's bottom two sides and have suffered defeats by Liverpool, Manchester City and West Brom. The run leaves them seven points worse off than at the same stage last season, when they eventually won the title by 11 points. BBC pundit Alan Hansen says the poor run of form is in danger of ending their hopes this term. "In terms of the title, they are certainly on the verge of losing it as a consequence of their unconvincing start to the season," Hansen wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.  "United were truly awful at times in the early weeks and months of last season, but the difference between then and now was that they dragged themselves to victories with the late surges that are missing now. "Maybe that is down to the 'Fergie factor', but it is more likely down to the inevitability that, sooner or later, the tide begins to turn." Former Everton manager Moyes has already admitted filling the void left by Ferguson after his 27 years and 38 trophies at Old Trafford will be difficult. Ex-United striker Dion Dublin, speaking to MOTD2 Extra, believes Ferguson is missed. "As a player who played at Old Trafford for Coventry and Villa, you sometimes lose the game before you get off the coach because you're in such awe of the stadium and players you are going to play against - and managers can be the same," said Dublin. "Ferguson's not there anymore, so players are thinking 'hold on, we've got a chance here'." </body>

      <body>Former world champions France have been drawn against Ukraine in the European play-offs for the 2014 World Cup. Portugal face Sweden, which means either Cristiano Ronaldo or Zlatan Ibrahimovic will not take part in next summer's tournament in Brazil. Iceland, the lowest-ranked team in the play-offs, must beat Croatia to reach their first ever major tournament, while Greece meet Romania. The two-legged ties will be played on 15 November and 19 November. The eight nations all finished second in the qualifying groups, with 1998 World Cup winners France runners-up to current holders Spain in Group I. Ukraine were beaten to automatic qualification by Group H rivals England. Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine were the four seeded teams in the draw which took place on Monday. The four teams that qualify will complete a total of 13 European nations at the tournament in Brazil. </body>

      <body>Rory McIlroy says he is getting back to his best after finishing joint second in the Korean Open. The 24-year-old Northern Irishman carded five birdies in his final round to finish a shot behind winner Kang Sung-hoon. "Things are definitely on the up," said McIlroy. "I feel like I'm getting back to where I need to be. "I've had to stay patient this season - it hasn't been one of my best - but it's getting there, it definitely is." It was McIlroy's second top-five finish of a difficult year in which he has slipped to sixth in the world rankings. The former world number one was 10 shots off the lead after three rounds in Korea but fired an impressive 67 to finish on five under par. McIlroy will play in the BWM Masters  on Thursday before taking part in the HSBC WGC Championships  a week later. Both tournaments are in Shanghai. "I'm excited about these next two weeks in China," McIlroy said. "They're a big two weeks for me to get a little bit of momentum for the end of the season and going into 2014. "My putter let me down in the last couple of days [in Korea]. If I can get the putting right, hopefully I'll have a chance." </body>

      <body>Tim Cahill scored the fastest goal in Major League Soccer history with his effort after eight seconds for New York Red Bulls on Sunday. Ex-Everton midfielder Cahill, 33, volleyed in from outside the area in a 3-0 win over Houston Dynamo to beat the previous record of 11 seconds set by Dwayne de Rosario in 2003. "It was a special goal and something I won't forget," said Cahill. The Red Bulls top the Eastern Conference with one game to play. Australian Cahill left Everton midway through last year's MLS season and plays alongside former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry. Now in his first full season, he is the club's top scorer with 11 goals. A run of seven games without defeat has helped the Red Bulls reach top spot in the Eastern Conference. They needed to finish in the top five to qualify for the MLS Cup, a knockout tournament that also includes the best five teams from the Western Conference. Former England midfielder David Beckham was part of the Los Angeles Galaxy team which won the MLS Cup in 2012. </body>

      <title>Ten reasons to watch the Rugby League World Cup</title>
      <description>Big stars, cheap tickets, feisty rivalries and fascinating stories - there are plenty of reasons to watch the Rugby League World Cup</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/24481185</url>
      <date>1382338104</date>

      <body>The Rugby League World Cup begins on 26 October, with 14 teams taking part in the tournament across the UK, Ireland and France. Though the international game is traditionally dominated by Australia, New Zealand and England - where it is sometimes seen as a sport for the M62 corridor and little more - the World Cup is an opportunity for rugby league to reach beyond its core demographic. From defying fascism to Fijians in Rochdale, expensive players to cheap tickets, BBC Sport gives you 10 reasons to take notice. Perhaps the biggest cross-code star in rugby, New Zealand second-rower Sonny Bill Williams could swell World Cup gates just by showing up. A headline-grabber on and off the pitch, Williams helped Sydney Roosters win the National Rugby League (NRL) title in his first season back in league after completing a five-year ban for walking out on Canterbury Bulldogs. In his time away, the 28-year-old played union in France, Japan and his native New Zealand, as well as helping the All Blacks win the World Cup in 2011. A return to union looks on the cards and seemed certain when he made himself unavailable for the tournament because of "other commitments", only for a change of heart 24 hours later and the subsequent confirmation that he will stay in league for a year at least. Now, the man who is also New Zealand's heavyweight boxing champion  (six wins from six fights) has the chance to fill the only gap on his CV, having missed out when the Kiwis triumphed in 2008. Little-known outside of rugby league circles in the UK, Sam Burgess and his twin brothers George and Tom are celebrities in Australia, especially league-loving Sydney. All three - along with a fourth Burgess brother, Luke - play for NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs, Sam having been persuaded to move down under in 2009 by Souths owner Russell Crowe.  Crowe's treatment of Sam - before his Souths debut, Sam was presented with a Rabbitohs membership card for his late father Mark - led to the other three Burgess boys following and, earlier this year, they became the first quartet of brothers since 1910 to play for an Australian top-flight side in the same game. With mum Julie also having moved to Sydney, the only disappointment for the Burgess family came when Luke missed out on a place in the England squad for the World Cup. On top of all that, Sam has developed something of a rivalry with Sonny Bill Williams. Just after Williams took to the field for his league return, Burgess powered through Williams's attempted tackle, a steamrollering that has since been watched more than 300,000 times on YouTube.  Will the two lock horns once more during the World Cup? The Rugby League World Cup will be something of a farewell tour - for now, at least - for England full-back Sam Tomkins, who is joining NRL side New Zealand Warriors. A world-record fee was paid to prise Tomkins away from Wigan, a sum in excess of the £450,00 paid by the Super League champions for Bradford's Stuart Fielden in 2006. Intelligent, twinkle-toed and blessed with a touch of genius, Tomkins - the 2012 Super League Man of Steel - is England's all-time leading try-scorer. Wigan have the first option on Tomkins should he decide to leave his new side, but with the possibility of the 24-year-old following brother Joel into union in the future, opportunities to see him play league in England are now at a premium. With 28 games scheduled for 21 venues  across England, Wales, Ireland and France, the Rugby League World Cup is nothing if not accessible. While most of the stadiums used are around rugby league's traditional M62 heartland, the tournament also finds its way to union strongholds Neath, Bristol, Limerick and Cardiff, where the Millennium Stadium hosts the opening double-header when England face Australia and Wales take on Italy. Prices are reasonable too, with 55% of tickets costing £20 or less  and six grounds offering buy one, get one half-price deals. But the best deal may be reserved for the semi-finals at Wembley, with both games played on 23 November and tickets starting at £20. Pickles the dog earned a place in football history for discovering the Jules Rimet Trophy a week after it was stolen in March 1966 - but that story pales in comparison to the mystery surrounding the Rugby League World Cup trophy.  Commissioned for the inaugural tournament in France in 1954 at a cost of eight million Francs, the trophy was used until 1970, when the holders, Australia, put it on display in the Midland Hotel in Bradford. Stolen six days before the final, it would not be seen again for 20 years. In 1990, it was found on a rubbish dump in the city by Stephen Uttley, who eventually identified it with the help of a local newspaper. When the trophy was returned to Rugby Football League headquarters in Leeds, an official said: "It is like the return of the Holy Grail. No-one knows what its value is, but in rugby league terms it is priceless." Fiji's game with Ireland at Rochdale's Spotland on 28 October may seem to have little significance aside from the fact it is both sides's opening game in Group A, but it may provide the most raucous atmosphere of the entire tournament. Thanks to Joe Levula and Orisi Dawai, recruited by Rochdale Hornets  in 1961, Rochdale has the UK's biggest Fijian population outside of London. The affection shown to Levula and Dawai by Hornets fans was reciprocated, with Rochdale becoming imprinted on the minds of Fijians 10,000 miles away. Fijians recruited to the British Army would travel to Rochdale, and the resulting community would eventually boost the Greater Manchester town's bid to host the tournament. Rochdale will go even more Fijian for the Ireland game - special menus will be served in pubs, a Fiji Celebration Day will be held and hotels are sold out. The Irish should expect a partisan crowd. Describing rugby league as the toughest sport in the world is a big claim, but there is science to back it up. International rugby league players lose more playing time through injury  than any other sport - 220 hours per 1,000 compared to 112 in American Football, 80 in ice hockey, 40 in football and 10 in cricket. In a tackle, a rugby league player feels a force of over 10G, the same as a car crash. If that doesn't convince you, consider some of the injuries suffered at the top level. Harlequins full-back Ben Jones-Bishop once played 25 minutes against Wigan with a cracked skull, Great Britain's Paul Deacon fractured the roof of his mouth in a 2005 international against New Zealand and Warrington Wolves prop Paul Wood played on with a ruptured testicle, subsequently having it removed. These boys are hard as nails. In the run-up to World War II, rugby league was on an unstoppable rise in France - 225 clubs had been established in five years. Seen as modern, innovative and linked to the pre-war left-wing government, it was banned by the Vichy regime - the puppets of Nazi Germany - after some lobbying from French rugby union, itself in decline. The French had been pushing for a World Cup since 1935 and the dream was realised by Paul Barriere, a former union player who met league leaders when part of the French resistance. Barriere worked to restore league in France following the war and, in 1951, proposed a World Cup, with the idea being adopted at a meeting in Blackpool in 1953. The inaugural tournament was held in France in 1954, with the hosts narrowly beaten by Great Britain in the final. After hosting once more in 1972 and sharing duties with the UK in 2000, France again welcomes two games in the 2013 tournament. For 25 years, the Rugby League World Cup was a showcase of Australia's dominance. Six consecutive titles gave them nine out of 12 overall. But that run came to a halt in the 2008 final with a 34-20 defeat by New Zealand in the Aussies's Brisbane backyard. Now, the Kangaroos travel north to regain what they see as their property, spearheaded by the trio of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and Billy Slater. Named in the top four players in the NRL  by the Sydney Morning Herald, each man has also won the Golden Boot Award - given to the player voted the best in the world - in the past six years. Smith, the captain, is a formidable presence at hooker, Slater has scored more tries than any other full-back in NRL history and creative half-back Thurston was the leading points scorer five years ago. While the Rugby League World Cup has been an almost exclusive preserve of Australia success, their 2008 failure was proof that the tournament is not a closed shop. New Zealand, boosted by the inclusion of Williams, travel with hope of defending their title, while co-hosts England, perhaps with the benefit of a post-Olympic bounce, are genuine contenders, despite the shock warm-up defeat by Italy. It would be a surprise if the world's leading trio do not fill three of the four semi-final spots, with the last slot up for grabs to the rest of a field that could use unfancied Fiji's run to the last four in 2008 as inspiration. The unorthodox format  is an attempt to keep one-sided contests to a minimum, a theory that was largely successful five years ago - the majority of lower-ranked nations will not have to meet the big boys until the knockout stage. 35 days. 28 games. 21 venues. 14 teams. One team crowned rugby league world champions. Bring it on. </body>

      <title>Taxman takes on 'pension liberators'</title>
      <description>The UK's tax authority is stepping up its scrutiny of pension funds amid concerns over people being enticed into cashing in their pension early.</description>

      <body>The UK's tax authority is stepping up its scrutiny of pension funds amid concerns over people being enticed into cashing in their pension early. Pension liberation schemes encourage people to access their pension savings before the age of 55. These schemes will no longer be automatically registered to receive funds when an online form is received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Now the details will be scrutinised before they can operate. "The changes to our process are part of a government-wide initiative involving HMRC and other agencies aiming to detect, disrupt and deter promoters of pension liberation schemes and to ensure that individuals are aware of the true tax position," a spokesman for the tax authority said. "The vast majority of pension funds abide by their legal obligations but we won't hesitate to de-register a pension scheme where rules are not adhered to." Up to 70% of any funds released from a pension early can go to the tax authority. This is because pension saving is tax privileged, under the proviso that the funds are not touched until the saver reaches the age of 55 at least. These liberation scheme operators can also charge high fees, often between 10% and 20% of the amount "released". The operators of pension liberation schemes tend to work in the grey areas of the law, according to the regulator. Introducers to the schemes, or advisers, use text messages, cold calls, or website promotions to encourage people to access their "frozen" pension. They might suggest that people take a loan from the scheme provider, secured on their pension funds. Alternatively, the money might be transferred from the pension scheme into risky, unregulated investments often based overseas, the Pensions Regulator said. </body>

      <title>Don't cut our expenses, say MPs</title>
      <description>A powerful group of MPs rejects a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses for hotels, second homes, TVs, taxis and tea and biscuits.</description>

      <body>A powerful MPs' group has rejected a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wants to ban claims for tea and biscuits and installing televisions in second homes. It also proposes cutting costs on hotel bills and evening meals. But the Commons Standards Committee insists that other professionals would be able to claim such expenses in compensation for unsociable hours. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up following the MPs' expenses scandal of 2009 and it has frequently come into conflict with those whose behaviour it was set up to police. In its latest report, it proposed MPs should get a £7,000 pay rise. But it said they should no longer be able to claim for: Ipsa says these perks cost the taxpayer £161,000 in 2011/12, about £250 per MP, and that most professional people would be expected to pay for them themselves. But the Standards Committee, in its formal submission to Ipsa's consultation, disagrees, saying MPs are like police, solicitors and junior doctors and should be able to claim expenses in compensation for "regular unsocial hours or residence away from home". It adds: "Practices vary widely within and between professions. In some professions there is indeed no reimbursement for unsocial hours and the associated costs of those hours but salaries may be supplemented to compensate." The committee is asking Ipsa to "establish an evidence base for the proposals", adding: "We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses." It says: "We find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 0100 before booking a hotel." On the curb on taxis before 2300, the committee says: "We are also concerned about the effects of such rules on members' ability to perform their duties effectively. "We note that many committees begin work at 08.55, and members are expected to attend regardless of the hour at which they ended their work the night before." And on the ban on claims for getting a TV installed, it says: "Since MPs' work involves being informed and available at virtually any hour, we consider access to media and the internet when residing away from home is a legitimate business expense." The consultation on the proposals - including the pay rise - ended on Sunday. Ipsa says it will announce its final decision on both pay and conditions before Christmas. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>University demand 'to rise by 26%'</title>
      <description>Universities minister says demand for undergraduate places will grow by a quarter in two decades.</description>

      <body>The number of places at UK universities will have to grow by at least a quarter over the next 20 years, the universities minister has warned. David Willetts says in a paper for the Social Market Foundation that the number of places needs to grow from 368,000 to 460,000 to meet demand. Universities have seen a squeeze on places in recent years, with thousands of students failing to get on courses. The primary school place shortage could go on to hit undergraduates, he says. The paper from the universities minister is billed as his projection of the future of higher education in the UK. It seeks to update a report written 50 years ago when just 5% of young people went to university. The Robbins report called for and led to a bold expansion in university places. It rested on the guiding principle that higher education should be open to all able and qualified enough to go. Robbins considered what the demand was likely to be over the next 20 years - based on the number of suitably qualified young people, not economic forecasts of future jobs. The projections in Mr Willetts's pamphlet follow this model and suggests there will be a need for 92,000 more places for England-based students in UK universities in the next 20 years. He says the current demographic backdrop is very different to the 1960s, when the country was in the grip of a baby boom, because of the fall in the number of babies born in the 1990s. But he adds: "However, looking ahead to the 2020s, we can see the increase in the number of births since the turn of the century feeding through into more young people. Those pressures have already been felt in our nurseries and primary schools." He also argues that as educational standards in England improve over the coming years, there will be a greater supply of young people with the potential to go to university, thus increasing demand still further. And he goes on to highlight differences between the English higher education system and European ones, hinting at a more liberal approach. He also says: "The English system is quite unusual amongst advanced countries for having such selective systems of entry to university... Other countries allow virtually automatic progression to your local university if you have the requisite qualifications." Although the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has introduced more flexibility in the system, with universities being allowed to recruit unlimited numbers of brighter students (those gaining certain high grades), overall the numbers have remained fairly static since 2010. But it is expected numbers will begin to recover again this coming year when admissions quotas for individual universities are being relaxed. When the Robbins report was published in 1963 there were nearly 216,000 full-time students in higher education. Robbins projected this number would grow to 558,000 by 1980-81. Director of the Social Market Foundation Emran Mian said: "David Willetts provides a compelling case for expanding higher education. This is our best bet for equipping the UK economy with the skills it needs and improving social mobility." The report stops short of saying how such demand will be met. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the pamphlet was Mr Willetts's personal view but would not comment further. </body>

      <description>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets.</description>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become un-useable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <body>Rock legend David Bowie has been left empty-handed at this year's Q Awards, despite receiving six nominations. He was trounced by Ellie Goulding in the prize for best solo artist, while Vampire Weekend beat him to the award for "best act in the world today". The 66-year-old's comeback record, The Next Day - given five stars by Q Magazine in April - lost out to Biffy Clyro in the best album category. The awards are chosen by readers of the monthly music magazine and its website. Biffy Clyro's Simon Neill said: "Thank you so so much. I think I speak on every award winner's behalf when I say thank goodness David Bowie didn't turn up." Glastonbury won best event of 2013, beating Bowie's exhibition at the VandA Museum, and Kraftwerk's series of 3D live shows at Tate Modern. Best single went to Arctic Monkeys, for Do I Wanna Know?; while The Manic Street Preachers took home best video, for Show Me The Wonder. Comic Al Murray quipped as the Manics left the stage: "The Manic Street Preachers. Apart from Doctor Who, the only industry left in Wales." Starring Submarine actor Craig Roberts, the miniature love story was filmed in the Pioneer Working Men's Club in Porth, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales. Teenage singer-songwriter Jake Bugg was named best new act, while cerebral Oxford rockers Foals won the best live band trophy. Yannis Philippakis, lead singer from the band, said: "It shows you don't need a backing track, you don't need affectation, you don't need Elvis Presley impersonations." Bowie, who did not attend the award ceremony, was expected to win several prizes following his surprise comeback in January after a 10-year hiatus. Q Magazine had showered his album with praise, calling it "a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that... sound like they desperately need to be sung". However, he was not the only artist to walk away empty-handed. Daft Punk, the French dance duo whose inescapable single Get Lucky has contributed to the best year for British single sales in history, also failed to win any of the three categories in which they were nominated. The annual ceremony also distributes a number of lifetime achievement awards, decided by "Q's resident musical experts". This year's recipients included Chrissie Hynde (classic songwriter), Robbie Williams (Q Idol) and reinvigorated rock band Suede (Q Icon). Williams joked as he collected his award: "Sorry I couldn't be here in person to receive this. Of all the made-up awards to get a celebrity to an awards show, this is definitely one of them." The Pet Shop Boys were also given the Outstanding Contribution to Music award. "We keep being told that these are tough times for the industry, but the evidence here suggests the opposite," said Q's senior editor Matt Mason. "We're particularly delighted to salute evergreen artists such as Robbie, the Pet Shop Boys and Suede, who've all made excellent new music over the last 12 months. "They're brilliant reminders of the enduring power of the great British pop act." </body>

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>Two economists with conflicting views on the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the Nobel prize. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24579616</url>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is room for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>The latest property of choice for holiday home buyers in Southern Italy is not a rustic villa or a rambling farmhouse - it is a former farmer's shed, which would not look out of place on the set of Lord of the Rings. Trulli are the trademark of Puglia - existing nowhere but the Valley of Itria. Round limestone buildings with conical roofs, they are as magical as they are historical. Dotted across the landscape, alone or in clusters, with one cone or even a dozen, they look like miniature rustic fairytale castles - Asterix meets Disney. Originally nothing more than farmers' sheds used to store equipment or animals, the structure is made with the same drystone technique as the low walls that demarcate the olive groves. No cement, just local limestone cut into large, heavy slabs called chiancarelle - carefully positioned to make the perfect water-tight structure. It is said that back in the 1600s, when there was a tax on new buildings, the locals built trulli so they could be dismantled when the inspectors came and rebuilt after they had gone. In between viewings estate agent, Alessandro Melpignano tells us enthusiastically about the trullo revival. They became trendy holiday homes when the Trulli of Alberobello became a Unesco world heritage site in 1996. "That is when the market really exploded", he explains. The first to buy were the Germans, who soon got fed up with break-ins. The British were hot on their heels. "But they have stayed," says Melpignano. "And they are still buying. Low-cost flights to Bari and Brindisi have helped keep them coming." Trulli need renovating every 100 to 150 years. It takes around a month to rebuild a cone and costs about 15,000 euros (£12,700). Do they have experts who renovate and rebuild trulli? "Oh yes," he grins. "They are called trullari. And I know a master trullaro." The next morning I go in search of Giovanni d'Errico and find him, unsurprisingly, building a trullo. If anybody ever looked the part, it is d'Errico, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Hobbit. He tells me he has always been passionate about trulli, but when he was young, nobody cared about them. "They were mostly abandoned ruins. People saw them as hovels for the poor." "I became a trullaro about 20 years ago. Before that I was a tiler. When I began, there was just one trullaro left in this area. It was a dying trade. Now there are loads of us." I wonder if d'Errico thinks tourists are mad for falling in love with old farmers' sheds? On the contrary, he says he is supremely grateful. "They gave us work and a bit of well-being - they brought our abandoned land back to life. "Even if it has slowed down with the recession and heavy taxes on homeowners, our profession's still growing. I do not make a fortune but I do love my job. It is a beautiful thing that everyone wants a trullo." According to Giuseppe Miccolis, another master trullaro specialising in historic trulli, "the problem is that anyone can set himself up as a trullaro without any formal training or qualification". Miccolis, who comes from a long line of trullari, was born into the profession. "At the age of three, I used to play with the stones. At 14 I started working." He considers his trade an art and a passion. But it is tinged with disappointment and frustration. "It is not just the unskilled self-styled trullari, it is the people who build illegally without respecting our landscape." Nevertheless, Giuseppe is determined to preserve his beloved traditional craft. He has begun taking school children on walks, visiting historic trulli and explaining and demonstrating how they are built. "I am hoping to inspire local kids to develop the passion my family passed on to me. I am going to organise walks for tourists too," he says. "Why don't you come back for one?" My eyes light up.

      <body>A Wolves fan who missed his first home game since 1976 to attend his stepdaughter's wedding is to be presented to the next home crowd to "mark his loyalty and support". Peter Abbott, from Ipswich, missed Saturday's match but will be back in Wolverhampton for Tuesday's fixture. The club sent its record goalscorer Steve Bull to the wedding as a surprise when it heard he would miss the match. It now intends to make a presentation to him on the pitch at the next match. Mr Abbott has been a fan of League One Wolverhampton Wanderers since 1970 and the last home match he missed was against Tottenham on 16 March 1976. He regularly makes the 330-mile (530km) round trip to the Molineux ground to see his team, but had to follow Saturday's 1-1 draw with Coventry by text, while attending the family wedding. He said he was "gutted" when he first realised the wedding of stepdaughter Sarah Butler and Jonathan Liddle coincided with the game. However, Wolves heard of his plight and decided to send Steve "Bully" Bull along with a signed shirt and programme from the match, to "soften the blow". Mr Abbott said it was "a big surprise" and described Bull as "a legend". Paul Richards, Wolves' supporter liaison officer, said: "We were only too happy to work with the sponsors... in getting Bully to attend the reception on Saturday, and are pleased it helped make Peter's day." He added: "There are many [fans] with great stories about how many games they have attended, but I'm not sure any can match the achievement of Peter in not missing a home game in 34 years. "We now want to mark his continuing loyalty and support of the club by making a presentation to him during half-time of Tuesday night's Oldham game. "In typical Peter fashion, he has already warned us that after being away from Molineux on Saturday, he doesn't want to miss a single second of the game so we must have him back in his seat well in advance of the start of the second half." </body>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. "I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <title>Grangemouth deal deadline approaches</title>
      <description>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos.</description>

      <body>Staff at the Grangemouth complex have until 18:00 to sign up to new terms and conditions put forward by site operator Ineos. The firm said that, by Sunday, it had received about 300 positive returns out of a workforce of 1,350. But the Unite union said it had been given more than 500 forms rejecting the offer on pay and pensions. The union has asked its 1,100 members at Grangemouth not to hand the forms to Ineos. It has accused the company of giving workers an ultimatum of accepting worse pay and conditions or losing their job. The 2.6 square-mile refinery and petrochemical site was shut down ahead of a planned strike by Unite members. It remains closed despite the 48-hour strike, which had been due to begin on Sunday, being called off. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. Calum MacLean, chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the company had received "around 300" forms by Sunday. Mr MacLean said he expected most of the returns to come in on Monday, and he "remained pretty confident" there would be strong support for the company from workers. He added: "Getting the plant back up and running again is not about necessarily the number of people, albeit that will influence when we can start it. "What is important here is that we have asked the unions to give us an assurance that there will be no strike action during the consultation period, which is the 45 to 60 days when we are going to sit down and negotiate with the employees and talk about the changes we are trying to impose. "People need to realise that this site has lost £150m per year for the last four years. It has got a pension fund which is £200m in deficit and it is on the point of going bust. "If it wasn't because of the support of the shareholders, who are funding those losses, then there is a very, very serious situation here which means the site may not start up again". Ineos has put forward what it calls a survival plan for Grangemouth and warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. These changes were detailed in letters sent to staff at the end of last week. They include freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support its survival plan at this stage will receive a transitional payment of up to £15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Unite said it had strongly advised its members at Grangemouth not to return the forms backing the changes to their contract. It accused Ineos of "bribes and blackmail". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, told Good Morning Scotland: "We have continuously given assurances of no strikes from now up until December. "In fact yesterday (Sunday), when we had a rally here, I gave a commitment that we would have no strikes for however long it took to allow negotiations to take place between ourselves and Ineos on the survival plan. We are not imposing any conditions. "Ineos wants to come to the negotiating table at the same time as threatening our members and threatening people here with the sack in 45 days. You can't negotiate and impose at the same time." Mr Rafferty said he expected the majority of workers have would reject the new pay and conditions. First Minister Alex Salmond repeated his calls for Ineos to "fire up the plant" and for Unite to commit to a "no strike - without strings - guarantee" at the SNP conference in Perth. Ineos shareholders are due to discuss the future of the complex on Tuesday. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who is scheduled to meet with Ineos later this week, urged the company to "withdraw the ultimatums delivered to the workforce". She said: "The company should also undertake to immediately reopen the plant and return to production and both the union and the company should return to meaningful talks, with Acas if necessary, to deliver a solution to this matter which has serious consequences for Scotland and the UK." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <body>Northern Ireland Finance Minister Simon Hamilton has announced that a new children's hospital is to be built in Belfast. The £250m facility will replace the existing hospital on the Royal site in Belfast. The announcement was made as part of a reallocation of unspent funds, mainly from the stalled A5 road project. The Department of Health has been allocated £52m, £15.5m of which is to go towards the new hospital. It is expected to be completed by 2020/2021. The department has also been allocated £14m to address waiting lists. Mr Hamilton said he had recently visited the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children and was "shocked and ashamed" by the conditions. Building on the new hospital could begin next year. Other health projects allocated money include: Mr Hamilton has also given the green light to dualling the Frosses Road section of the A26. "The allocations I have announced today will leave a lasting economic impact on Northern Ireland, boost our economy as the recovery gathers momentum and provide assistance for vulnerable people in our society," Mr Hamilton said. "I am especially pleased that we are able to fund a new regional children's hospital and significant strategic roads improvements." Health Minister Edwin Poots said the money would help provide services fit for the 21st century for children. "A replacement regional children's hospital is a major project that I have been keen to take forward, particularly as parts of the current facilities are nearly 100 years old," he said. "Securing this additional funding from the executive provides me with the opportunity to move this much needed project forward to ensure that our children will receive their care and treatment in a modern paediatric environment." </body>

      <title>Shankill bomber apology dismissed</title>
      <description>A man whose wife was killed in the 1993 Shankill bomb says one of the bomber's apology is meaningless.</description>

      <body>A man whose wife was killed in the 1993 Shankill bomb has said he does not believe one of the IRA bombers who apologised about the lives lost. IRA man Thomas Begley and nine Protestant civilians were killed in the 1993 attack in Belfast. On Sunday, a memorial ceremony was held for Begley. The other bomber, Sean Kelly, told the crowd he was sorry for the loss of life. Alan McBride, whose wife died in the blast, said his apology was hollow. "He (Kelly) went out that day, I have no doubt he was trying to murder UDA men upstairs in that shop, so I'm not suggesting for a minute my wife was the intended target, but she wasn't even considered, her life wasn't even considered that it was worth anything," Mr McBride said. "He left that bomb on the counter and the timescale for them getting out of that was so small that they had to have known the potential for innocent casualties to be taken that day was huge and that's exactly what happened. "So for Sean Kelly to come out now and say he's sorry, I don't really believe him." Charlie Butler, who lost three relatives in the attack - his niece Evelyn Baird, her partner Michael Morrison and their seven-year-old daughter Michelle - said the apology was "20 years too late". "I don't think any apology will bring back what happened," he said. He said he respected the right of the Begley family to remember their son, but added: "I think there's better ways of remembering your son than being a child murderer and a murderer of women and pensioners." During Sunday's ceremony, Billy Begley, Thomas Begley's father unveiled a plaque stating that the bomber "died on active service" and is "always remembered by his many comrades and friends". In a brief speech at the ceremony, his father, thanked the crowd and said: "As you well know, this is not a celebration or a glorification of that tragic day that happened. It's also (not to) degrade the innocent people on the Shankill Road." The crowd was also addressed by Sean Kelly, the IRA man who was with Begley on the day and survived the bomb. He described it "an IRA operation that went tragically wrong". "I offer no excuse that will change how any of these innocent people and families will think about myself or Thomas or the IRA as a result of this operation. I am truly sorry for the loss of life and the injuries that were suffered that day and for the suffering the families have endured," Kelly added. There were two protests against the commemoration, one involving victims families and another one staged by loyalist youths on the Crumlin Road. The nine other people killed in the IRA attack included two children age seven and 13. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in October in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. Begley and Kelly posed as fishmongers and carried the bomb into Frizzell's fish shop where shoppers were queuing for food. In addition to the 10 deaths, a further 57 people were injured by the bomb. The wounded included Kelly, who was pulled from the rubble of the collapsed building. He received a total of nine life sentences for his role in the attack but was released early in July 2000, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Families of some of the Shankill bomb victims condemned the commemoration when the plans emerged earlier this month. The Begley family, from Ardoyne in north Belfast, had previously publicly stated their opposition to the Shankill Road bombing and their son's role in the IRA attack. Last week, the bomber's brother, Sean Begley, told the Belfast News Letter that his family had not been involved in producing the flyer or the plaque tribute, but would be attending the memorial service to mark the 20th anniversary of his death. Michelle Williamson, who lost both her parents in the explosion, wrote a personal letter to Begley's parents, asking them to call off the ceremony. She told them she had "no problem in acknowledging your loss" but said the unveiling of the plaque to a bomber was "a sick and cruel insult to the memory of our loved ones". </body>

      <body>Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away after 14 caravans moved onto the 300-space area. Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on. He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result. But one hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said it was "infuriating". "Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing," the worker said. "I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. "There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. "They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp." Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: "Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. "It just shouldn't be allowed to happen. "It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. "I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon." Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately 65 spaces. "We will ensure that security is available on site from 6am-10pm every day to reassure and support staff," he said. "We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible - there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible. "There has been no disruption to hospital services and, in the main, staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning." </body>

      <body>More than 40 people have been killed and scores wounded in an attack on villages in South Sudan's Jonglei state, an army spokesman has said. The attackers were believed to be members of David Yau Yau's rebel group, the spokesman said. Jonglei is badly affected by ethnic rivalries and disputes over land and cattle ownership. More than 1,500 people are estimated to have been killed in the area since South Sudan's independence in 2011. Tens of thousands have also been left homeless by the fighting. Col Philip Aguer, the army spokesman, told the BBC at least two villages were burnt during the attack on Sunday. The militiamen were armed with machine guns and RPG rocket launchers, he added. Thousands of cattle had also been stolen during the attack, the acting governor of Jonglei, Hussein Maar, said, Associated Press news agency reports. South Sudan is awash with small arms after decades of conflict against Khartoum's rule. Khartoum gave it independence in 2011 following talks brokered by the US and regional countries. Cattle lie at the heart of life for many communities in the country which has hardly any banks - they are used as a form of wealth, to pay dowries and as a source of food in the lean season. A single cow can be worth hundreds of dollars depending on its colouring. </body>

      <body>Three people, including a girl aged eight, died when gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on a wedding party outside a Coptic Christian church in Cairo. At least nine others were wounded in the attack in Giza, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Egypt's Coptic Christian community has been targeted by some Islamists who accuse the Church of backing the army's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in July. The unidentified attackers fired indiscriminately as people left the church. A man and a girl were killed outside the church and a woman died on her way to hospital. "We heard a very loud sound as if something was collapsing," one eyewitness said. "I found a woman seated in a chair with lots of bullet wounds, covered in blood. Many other people had fallen around her, including a child," he added. Coptic priest Thomas Daoud Ibrahim said he was inside the church when the gunfire erupted. "What happened is an insult to Egypt, and it's not only directed against Coptic Christians. We are destroying our own country," he said. Another priest, Beshay Lotfi, told Egyptian media that the church had been left without a police guard since the end of June. The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD. Christians make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million, and have generally coexisted peacefully with majority Sunni Muslims for centuries. However, the overthrow of Mr Morsi by the military has been followed by the worst attacks on churches and Christian properties in years. When head of the armed forces, Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, went on television to announce that the Islamist president had been deposed in the wake of mass opposition protests demanding his resignation, Pope Tawadros II appeared alongside him. Pope Tawadros said that the "roadmap" mentioned by the general had been devised by honourable people, who had Egypt's best interests at heart. He has since received death threats, while several Christians have been killed. Christian shops, homes and businesses have also been targeted. </body>

      <body>Smog has choked China's northern city of Harbin, Heilongjiang province, forcing schools and highways to shut and disrupting flights on Monday. The density of airborne particles was several times above World Health Organisation recommended limits. Visibility was reduced to below 50m (160ft) in parts of the city, reports said. Local media have linked the pollution to the city switching on its public heating system for winter. PM2.5 levels, used to measure the amount of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometres in the air, were above 500 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday morning, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. World Health Organization guidelines say average daily concentrations of PM2.5 should be no more than 25 microgrammes per cubic metre. All of Heilongjiang province's highways, and the Taiping International Airport in Harbin were forced to close, Xinhua reported. A red alert for thick smog had been issued in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, the news agency added. Earlier this year, air pollution in China's capital, Beijing, also soared past hazardous levels. The smog generated extensive discussion on Sina Weibo, one of China's Twitter-like microblogs. "We were all late for class today because we couldn't find the academic building," microblog user MaltzZz from Jilin province wrote. Harbin-based Sina Weibo user Backpacker Xiao described Harbin as "today's dead city". "Beijing, you're no longer alone. You have us too now," he wrote, in reference to the frequent air pollution suffered by Beijing. Meanwhile, netizen Pen and Ink Silent, a student in Changchun, Jilin, posted the following tongue-in-cheek message: "My mother called... and asked how the air in Changchun was, and if I was coughing.

      <title>India probes toxic alcohol deaths</title>
      <description>Officials in India begin an inquiry after at least 42 people die from drinking toxic alcohol in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</description>

      <body>Officials in India have begun an inquiry after at least 42 people died from drinking toxic alcohol in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Dozens of people are recovering in hospitals and officials say they expect the number of dead to rise further. Police say they have raided several places and arrested 12 people. They say the liquor was spiked with excessive chemicals which made it poisonous. Deaths from contaminated alcohol are a regular occurrence in India. The homemade alcohol - commonly called desi daroo in India - usually costs as little as 10 rupees (20 US cents) and the majority of the consumers are poor people. Chemicals and pesticides are often added to the alcohol to increase the strength or improve the flavour and the tainted liquor can lead to fits, vomiting and death. People in eight villages of Mubarakpur area in Azamgarh district consumed illegal alcohol on Friday after which they fell ill, police said. "At least 42 people have died in hospitals but we expect the toll to be higher since many bodies have been cremated by families without informing the police or the medical authorities," the chief medical officer in Azamgarh, BB Singh, told the BBC. Some of the victims have gone blind after drinking the toxic brew, officials said. Half a dozen policemen and five officials from the state's excise department have been suspended by the state government. India has witnessed many toxic alcohol deaths over recent years. Some 169 people were killed in West Bengal in December 2011, while 107 people died in Gujarat in July 2009. Nearly 200 people died in Orissa in 1992 after consuming a deadly combination of methyl and ethyl alcohol. Gujarat has taken the strongest action on toxic liquor with a law that makes the illegal manufacture and sale of toxic alcohol there punishable by death. It says the law was intended to deter those involved in the illegal trade. Gujarat, Mizoram and Nagaland are the only states in India where alcohol is totally prohibited by law. </body>

      <description>A suspected suicide bomb attack on a bus in Volgograd, southern Russia, has killed five people and injured more than 20, officials say.</description>

      <body>An explosion that killed at least five people on a bus in the southern Russian city of Volgograd was caused by a bomb, Russian officials say. They suspect a female suicide bomber - the partner of an Islamist militant - carried out the attack. The blast, which happened just after 14:00 (10:00 GMT), also injured more than 20 people, some of them seriously. The North Caucasus, to the south, has seen many attacks by Islamist militants in recent years. It is believed there were 40 people on board the bus, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow reports. He says that all buses in Volgograd have been ordered back to their depots to be searched for any sign of explosives. One man whose daughter survived the explosion told Moscow Echo radio: "It was a powerful explosion - a huge blast. There were lots of students on the bus." Earlier reports had suggested the blast might have been caused by an exploding gas canister. Volgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow. Vladimir Markin, of the Investigative Committee - Russia's equivalent of the FBI - told the RIA Novosti news agency: "A criminal case has been opened under articles outlining terrorism, murder and the illegal use of firearms." Other news agencies quoted sources at the committee as saying the suspected suicide bomber was the partner of a militant Islamist. One source said the woman had recently converted to Islam. In recent years, Russia has seen a number of attacks by women suicide bombers, known as black widows, who are often related to Islamist militants. Female suicide bombers struck at two underground railway stations in Moscow in 2010, killing more than 35 people. They were also believed responsible for explosions on two passenger jets at a Moscow airport in 2004 that killed about 90 people. Separatists in Chechnya have fought two wars with Russian forces over the past two decades. But the violence has spread across the North Caucasus in recent years, including to mainly-Muslim Ingushetia and Dagestan. Hundreds of people, including members of the government and security services, have been killed.

      <title>Russia faulted over Katyn inquiry</title>
      <description>The European Court of Human Rights says Russia has not explained why it kept key files secret over the 1940 Katyn massacre of Polish war prisoners.</description>

      <body>The European Court of Human Rights says Russia has failed to explain why it kept key files secret when it investigated the 1940 Katyn massacre of more than 20,000 Polish war prisoners. Russia failed to comply with a human rights obligation to provide evidence, the Strasbourg judges ruled. Soviet Russia only admitted to the atrocity in 1990 after blaming the Nazis for five decades. But the ruling also said the court had no authority to rule on the inquiry. The massacre in Katyn forest took place before the European Convention on Human Rights was signed. The court said it did not have competence to rule on Russia's handling of the Katyn investigation because too much time had elapsed between the massacre and the entry into force of the Convention. The court's examination came after 15 relatives of the victims claimed that Russia had failed to carry out an adequate investigation. They said Moscow had prevented them from finding out the truth about the killings in western Russia. The Strasbourg judges dismissed the applicants' claim for just satisfaction in the case, known as Janowiec v Russia. But the judges also said it must be assumed that the applicants' relatives had been killed at Katyn, as they had heard nothing since 1940 from the men who disappeared. Moscow started a criminal investigation into the killings the same year, but the inquiry was discontinued in 2004 on the orders of the Russian chief military prosecutor's office. Files about that decision remain classified, and the Polish claimants have not had access to it or any other information about the investigation. The court judgment on Monday - which is final - said states party to the Convention were "obliged to comply with its requests for evidence and found that Russia, in refusing to submit a key procedural decision which remained classified, had failed to comply with that obligation". They added that "the Russian courts had not conducted a substantive analysis of the reasons for maintaining the classified status". No-one has ever been convicted in connection with the massacre, with Russian prosecutors arguing that those responsible are now dead. However, in 2010 Russia's parliament issued a statement saying more work needed to be done in "verifying the lists of victims... and uncovering the circumstances of the tragedy". The parliament also said the killings had been carried out on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's orders. In 2010, Russia also published online six once-secret files on the mass killings. The documents had until then only been available to researchers. Poland has repeatedly demanded that Russia open all its files on Katyn. The killings were carried out by the Soviet secret police (NKVD) in April and May 1940 in the Katyn forest near the city of Smolensk, and also near the village of Mednoye, in the Tver region, and the village of Pyatykhatky in what was then Soviet Ukraine. The victims were members of the Polish elite, arrested after the USSR invaded and annexed eastern Poland in 1939. They were shot on the recommendation of NKVD head Lavrenty Beria, according to one of the published secret files. In a letter to Stalin dated 5 March 1940, Beria says the Polish prisoners of war should be executed and refers to them as "steadfast, incorrigible enemies of Soviet power". "Each of them is just waiting for liberation so as to actively join the struggle against Soviet power," it says. The letter bears Stalin's signature in blue pencil, with the comment: "In favour." In April 2010, Polish President Lech Kaczynski and more than 90 other government officials were killed when their plane crashed as it was trying to land at Smolensk airport to attend an event marking the Katyn massacre. </body>

      <title>Troops deployed at Rio oil auction</title>
      <description>Brazilian troops start patrolling the streets of Rio de Janeiro to prevent trouble ahead of a controversial oilfield auction on Monday.</description>

      <body>The Brazilian government has begun deploying troops on the streets of Rio de Janeiro ahead of a major auction for oil exploration rights. Some 1,100 soldiers sealed off the seafront hotel, where the auction of the huge offshore Libra field is due to take place on Monday. President Dilma Rousseff ordered tighter security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Anti-government protesters have also threatened to march on the auction. In scenes similar to country-wide protests in June, petrol and gas bombs were thrown last Tuesday after marches in support of striking teachers. The forthcoming auction of the Libra deepwater oilfield, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, added to the tension. On Thursday, oil workers launched a strike against the sale, disrupting production at more than 40 oil platforms and major refineries. Eleven international oil companies are said to be interested in the oilfield and nine of them have so far reportedly paid the required registration fee. But the auction is not without controversy with some critics saying Brazil should protect the monopoly of exploration of its oil reserves. But the government insists it is not privatising the country's resources. "We're taking over this immense wealth that lies under the sea and on land. It is not available to us if it stays where it is," Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told AFP news agency. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with state-run oil company Petrobras. On Sunday, the government said it had defeated 18 of 23 court actions lodged to prevent the sale from happening, at the Windsor Barra hotel in the Barra da Tijuca area of Rio. Other critics say the rules set by the government for the auction have scared off big players such as British Petroleum and Exxon for allegedly allowing too much state intervention. Thousands of people stated their intention to join demonstrations via social media at protests near the Windsor hotel. But the army says the area will be cordoned off. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. The government expects Libra's production to peak at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. The Libra field has estimated recoverable oil reserves of 8-12 billion barrels, according to the National Petroleum Agency. </body>

      <title>Hurricane Raymond nears Mexico coast</title>
      <description>A category three hurricane is slowly approaching the Pacific coast of Mexico, which only last month was badly hit by Tropical Storm Manuel.</description>

      <body>Hurricane Raymond has strengthened off Mexico's Pacific coast, meteorologists in Mexico say. The National Water Commission (Conagua) said Raymond had been upgraded to a category three hurricane. It is feared it could hit the same area of Guerrero state that was devastated by Tropical Storm Manuel last month. With sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph) Raymond is the first category three hurricane to approach Mexico this year, Conagua meteorologists said. Coastal towns and cities from the beach resort in Acapulco to Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan state have been put on alert as heavy rains are expected to lash the area for some 72 hours. Residents have been warned to stay away from rivers and streams as flash floods are likely. Schools in the area have been ordered to remain closed and the authorities in Michoacan said all maritime activity and road travel should be avoided. Mexico is still struggling to recover from two deadly storm which hit the country almost simultaneously last month. Storms Ingrid and Manuel left more than 150 people dead and caused billions of dollars of damage. Officials fear another storm could cause considerable damage as dozens of dams in the region are still over capacity. They warned people living in low-lying areas or along hillsides prone to mudslides to move to safer ground. The storm, which is some 200km south-southeast of the town of Zihuatanejo, is currently drifting northward, according to the US National Hurricane Center. </body>

      <title>Egypt PM denounces church attack</title>
      <description>Egypt's prime minister condemns an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl.</description>

      <body>Egypt's prime minister has condemned an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo on Sunday that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl. Hazem Beblawi said the security forces were searching for those responsible for the "callous and criminal act". He also vowed that it would "not succeed in sowing divisions" between the Christian and Muslim communities. Coptic activists have accused Mr Beblawi's interim government of failing to protect churches from attack. Their community has been targeted by some Islamists who accuse it of backing the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in July. In the latest attack, two masked gunmen riding on motorbikes fired indiscriminately at people emerging from a wedding service at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the capital's Waraa district on Sunday evening. Health ministry and ambulance service officials said four people were killed, including the girl and a woman, and 17 others were wounded. On Monday, mourners gathered at the church, whose walls were marked by bullets. Security personnel were also deployed on the street outside. Father Dawoud, a priest at the Church of the Virgin Mary told the AFP news agency: "What is happening is that all of Egypt is being targeted, not just the Christians. "Enough! People are getting sick and tired of this." In a cabinet statement, Mr Beblawi said police were investigating the attack, which he called a "callous and criminal act". "Such terrible acts will not succeed in dividing Muslims and Christians." The grand imam of al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's highest religious authority, said the attack ran "contrary to both religion and morals". The National Coalition to Support Legitimacy, a Muslim Brotherhood-dominated alliance calling for the reinstatement of Mr Morsi, urged police to bring the perpetrators to justice quickly and stressed the sanctity of places of all places of worship. The Association of Maspero Youth, a Coptic group formed in 2011 after more than 20 Christians were killed by soldiers outside the Maspero state television building, accused security forces of failing to protect churches. "If the Egyptian government does not care about the security and rights of Christians, then we must ask why we are paying taxes and why we are not arming ourselves if the police are not protecting us?'' it said. About 40 Coptic churches were destroyed in a wave of attacks in August after hundreds of people were killed when security forces broke up two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo. Islamist extremists have accused the Coptic Church of having conspired to oust the president. When the head of the armed forces, Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, went on television to announce that the Islamist president had been deposed in the wake of mass opposition protests demanding his resignation, Pope Tawadros II appeared alongside him. Pope Tawadros said that the general's "roadmap" had been devised by honourable people, who had Egypt's best interests at heart. He has since received death threats, while several Christians have been killed. Christian shops, homes and businesses have also been targeted. The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD. Today, Christians make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million. </body>

      <title>Riyadh 'ratcheting up repression'</title>
      <description>Amnesty International says Saudi Arabia has failed to act on recommendations by a UN body to improve its human rights and "ratcheted up" repression.</description>

      <body>Saudi Arabia has failed to act on recommendations by a UN body to improve human rights and instead "ratcheted up" repression, Amnesty International says. Promises the Gulf Kingdom made to the UN Human Rights Council in 2009 were "nothing but hot air", a report claims. The authorities continue to crack down on activists through "arbitrary arrests and detention, unfair trials, torture and other ill-treatment", it adds. The Human Rights Council will review Saudi Arabia in Geneva on Monday. On Friday, Riyadh refused to take up a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, accusing the body of failing in its duties towards Syria, as well as in other conflicts. In its report published on Monday, Amnesty said the kingdom had failed to implement any of the main recommendations from its last Universal Periodic Review by the Human Rights Council. "Four years ago, Saudi Arabian diplomats came to Geneva and accepted a string of recommendations to improve human rights in the country. Since then, not only have the authorities failed to act, but they have ratcheted up the repression," said Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director. "For all the peaceful activists that have been arbitrary detained, tortured or imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since, the international community has a duty to hold the authorities to account." Amnesty's report documents what it describes as a "new wave of repression against civil society" that has taken place since 2011. Human rights activists and supporters of political reform in the country face repressive measures that included arbitrary arrest, detention without charge or trial, unfair trials and travel bans, it says. In March, two founders of the prominent Saudi Civil and Political Rights Organisation (ACPRA), Abdullah al-Hamid and Mohammed al-Qahtani, were sentenced to 10 and 11 years respectively. The men, who used Twitter to promote human rights, were found guilty by a court of "breaking allegiance and disobeying the ruler", "undermining unity", "questioning the integrity of officials", "seeking to disrupt security" and "inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations". "These men are prisoners of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally. Their peaceful activism against human rights violations deserves praise not punishment. The only guilty party here is the government," Mr Luther said. Torture and other ill-treatment during detention is rife and carried out with impunity, the report says. The heavy reliance by the courts on "confessions" often extracted under torture, duress or deception has entrenched such abuses, it claims. It documents other alleged violations, including "systemic discrimination of women in both law and practice" and "abuse of migrant workers". The report also accuses the Sunni-ruled kingdom of "discrimination against minority groups", including Shia in Eastern Province, where many have been arrested for taking part in protests to demand greater rights and several have been killed in clashes with security forces. </body>

      <title>New Jersey has first gay weddings</title>
      <description>Gay couples in New Jersey tie the knot on the day the US state became the 14th in the nation to recognise same-sex marriages.</description>

      <body>Gay couples in New Jersey have been exchanging vows on the day the US state became the 14th in the nation to recognise same-sex marriages. Last month, a judge ruled that the state must recognise gay nuptials from Monday. Republican Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 White House candidate, attempted to delay that coming into effect, pending an appeal. But his administration's request was denied by the state's Supreme Court. A few minutes before midnight on Sunday, same-sex couples gathered in civic buildings across the state to wed. Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat who was elected last week to the US Senate, conducted some of the ceremonies at city hall. A protester was removed after shouting: "This is unlawful in the eyes of God and Jesus Christ." Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop conducted a joint ceremony for eight couples at the city council chambers. "I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime," said Barbara Milton after she was married to Kay Osborn, in remarks carried by the Associated Press news agency. "To have this moment of equality is overwhelming." Married gay couples in New Jersey can now receive all the state and federal benefits of marriage. But the legal battle is not quite over. The state's Supreme Court is due in January to hear an appeal by Gov Christie's office. Lawmakers in favour of gay marriage are also trying to overturn his veto of a 2012 bill that would have allowed gay weddings. The Republican has said marriage is between a man and a woman, and argued that a popular vote should determine the issue. </body>

      <title>Greenspan fears more debt deadlock</title>
      <description>Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan tells the BBC that the US debt ceiling crisis is far from over, that the eurozone needs political union, and "crony capitalism" is growing.</description>

      <body>Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that a repeat of the crisis that brought the country close to default is "perfectly conceivable". He told the BBC that he had not seen another situation in Washington where "compromise" seemed so far away. Mr Greenspan confessed to sympathies with the aims of the Tea Party, the Republican faction that fought the government during debt ceiling talks. But the former central banker said the movement's tactics were "undemocratic". Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over. The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees "consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going". He said: "The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. "The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be." But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy. "What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would," Mr Greenspan said. "As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected." Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market. He said: "One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010." There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said. He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. "I was very worried about what the impact would be." Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing "crony capitalism" in the US. He said: "Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in which… public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours." He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: "I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction." On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative. "One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. "There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. "Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means. "What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is that… unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down," Mr Greenspan said. Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not "think outside of the box" enough. </body>

      <body>A high proportion of violent crimes and rapes committed against sex workers rarely result in convictions in the UK. The average national conviction rate for alleged rapes on sex workers is just 6.5%. The Greater London Authority's Silence on Violence report found that sex workers in London are at least 12 times more likely to be murdered than the national average. The report also found that sex workers felt they cannot safely report crime to the police. Writer Ruth Jacobs, formerly in prostitution herself, investigates why violent crimes against sex workers often go unpunished. She meets Fiona MacTaggart MP, from the All Parliamentary Group on Prostitution, who says the police need to do more to protect women in the sex trade from violent attacks and rape. The same offenders are often those who go on to attack other members of society. Inside Out looks at a revolutionary model of policing prostitution run by Merseyside Police which has a 67% success rate on convictions for rapes against sex workers. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One London and North West on Monday 21, October at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>

      <title>Defence chief admits huge challenges</title>
      <description>Britain's new top general on the future of the armed forces</description>

      <body>The new Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Nick Houghton, says he has taken over at a time of "huge challenges". The UK's most senior military officer told the BBC the armed forces had shown great resilience in recent years. But Gen Houghton said it was too soon to judge the recruitment levels to the reserves, which are running at around half the planned levels. He is responsible for implementing cuts to the Army, while ensuring the Afghanistan withdrawal goes smoothly. UK troops are continuing to fight a campaign in Afghanistan, while preparing to withdraw - at the same time as reducing the number of regulars by 20,000 and bringing back troops based in Germany. Gen Houghton, an Oxford University history graduate and former Green Howard, is now the nation's most senior military officer and professional head of the armed forces. He is responsible for implementing the many simultaneous changes flowing from the Strategic Defence Review in 2010. The review cut 8% from the MoD's already stretched budget. In his first broadcast interview, Gen Houghton said: "If you just look at what the Army is being asked to do in terms of continuing to fight a campaign, to withdraw and downscale its numbers by 20,000 regulars, to bring 20,000 of its people back from Germany, to restructure, to build up the strength of the reserves, and during all this, take other things like public duties and Olympic security in its stride, yes, these are huge challenges." So what impact is this having on the armed forces, particularly on morale? "In terms of morale, it's not about individual happiness," he said. "It is about the ability to endure in times of real austerity, endure through times of hostility, in times of pressure. "And I think if anything has demonstrated the resilience of the morale of the British armed forces, it is the last couple of years - and the fact they still continue to perform, and are one of our nation's unique selling points." One of the tasks at the top of the agenda is the plan to continue cutting regulars in the Army to 82,000 from 102,000, while trying to increase the number of reservists from 19,000 to 30,000. Last week, MPs passed a motion that noted concerns about the government's defence reforms "in relation to whether its proposals for the reserve forces will deliver either the anticipated cost savings or defence capability". So with the current recruitment of reservists lagging well behind target, would he advise the government to think again? Gen Houghton said: "Well, I think this is more an argument in Parliament than it is one within the armed forces. "You can't compare these 82,000 regulars of the 21st Century with Victorian figures. These are 82,000 regulars, the vast percentage of which are deployable capability, not mess waiters or guards. "It's a force that's networked by modern communications. Private soldiers are connected to close air support and artillery fires. The capability of soldiers nowadays are transformed from what they were even a decade ago". "But of course, size is important, and that is why the reserves provide an essential and cost-effective mechanism of maintaining resilience." On the level of reservist recruitment so far, Gen Houghton insists it is too early to make a judgement. "We think that we have produced a good offer. We've got to get out the message that people who join now are joining something that is exciting, will give them all sorts of rewards and has a very, very strong future." However, after the Parliamentary vote on Syria that rejected UK military action, how does he see their role today? "Well, I think the message is that we've got to be quite hard-nosed about defining what the core national interest is when we want to use our armed forces, and the utility of doing so." That does not rule out military action abroad, but it may well be of a rather different sort from Iraq and Afghanistan. "We want to influence, to use our unique access in all sorts of countries to build capacity, to stabilise, and prevent conflict," Gen Houghton explains, "as well as being the 'go-to' organisation for domestic crisis, whether it's fire strikes, foot and mouth, or Olympic security." First, though, British combat forces must perform an orderly exit from Afghanistan by the end of next year after 12 years and 445 British lives lost. What is his verdict? "You've got to really take a strategic look," Gen Houghton said. "The United Kingdom has been part of an international effort to maintain the integrity of Afghanistan, to give that country the chance of looking after its own security, having a democratic process that elects the next president, that has the prospect of some prosperity and has not been the source of international terrorism. So I would deem that success." </body>

      <title>British forests under threat</title>
      <description>The caterpillars that can strip an oak tree bare</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <description>How the BBC's first man in Moscow got sent into the cold</description>

      <body>The BBC tried to open a bureau in Russia during World War II but only succeeded some 20 years later - in 1963. In the last half century, much has changed for the BBC's Man in Moscow. It was the summer of 1942 and Winston Churchill had flown to Russia to cement his wartime alliance with Joseph Stalin. "We will continue hand in hand like comrades and brothers," Churchill declared on arrival, "until every vestige of the Nazi regime has been beaten into the ground." Talk like this gave BBC bosses an idea. If Blighty and the Bolsheviks were suddenly best buddies, perhaps now was the moment to have a BBC correspondent based full-time in Moscow? So they sounded out the Soviets. And the answer came back: "Nyet!" A memo from the Assistant Controller of News written at the time reads: "The DG and editor-in-chief went to see the Soviet ambassador the other day and got no change at all. The Ambassador was extremely chilly. DG was left with the impression that nothing is likely to come of it." Mind you, it wasn't only Stalin who poured cold water on the idea. "I think all Moscow cover is a waste of time and money," argued the BBC Central European Correspondent. It was his job to report on Russia from the safety, and coffee-shop comfort of Vienna. In 1961 he tried to knock the whole idea on the head in a memo to his editor: "It is impossible in the USSR to get either official or unofficial reaction to anything except through the pages of the press the next day. Though this is often forgotten in London where it is naturally assumed correspondents will be able to go and talk to the renowned man-in-the-street. They can't. The opportunities for being a journalist are very slight indeed and to an experienced man this is very annoying." But when Soviet censorship eased under Nikita Khrushchev, the temptation to establish a permanent presence behind the iron curtain became irresistible and in 1963 the BBC finally opened a Moscow bureau. Erik de Mauny was the obvious choice for the BBC's first resident correspondent in the USSR. Not only did he have plenty of foreign reporting experience (previous postings included Vienna, Beirut and Washington), he also had a university degree in Russian. The BBC bought him a car, a dark green Humber Super Snipe, which had been specially adapted to cope with the cold. And to keep himself warm, the intrepid reporter had brought with him two key items - an ankle-length suede coat from Moss Bros and a pair of RAF flying boots. De Mauny wrote about his Moscow experiences in a book, Shouting Through the Static. Sadly, he died before it could be published. The manuscript reads like the screenplay for a James Bond film. Particularly the account of a scoop with a spook - his exclusive interview in 1964 with the spy, Kim Philby. The two men spent six hours in Philby's hotel suite getting drunk on vodka, wine and Armenian cognac, while Philby's KGB minder waited patiently in the corridor. Then de Mauny had a tough decision to make. I woke at 09:00 next morning with throbbing temples and with a realisation that I was in a dilemma. Should I send a news despatch to London about my meeting with Kim? What was more, should I mention it to any of my close colleagues? I knew I had a scoop, if I chose to play it that way, because apart from one brief sighting by a Reuters' correspondent some months earlier, no-one had tracked Kim down, still less talked to him at length as I had done. Nevertheless, I decided to wait. A news despatch would certainly make an impact, but it was highly likely to prove a nine-days wonder. I seemed to me sensible to keep my powder dry and wait to see whether my encounter with Kim might yield long-term benefits. After careful thought, however, I decided that the Embassy ought to be informed. So a bit later that morning, my hangover having subsided, I drove down to the big pseudo-Gothic mansion on the river embankment opposite the Kremlin. I found the Minister, Tom Brimelow, in his office and while we made small talk I slipped him a piece of paper on which I'd written: "I saw Kim Philby last night. Thought you might like to know about it." Tom contemplated this without emotion, but a few moments later he said, "That reminds me - I must have a word with the ambassador. I shan't be long." He was back a moment or two later with the ambassador, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, who gave me a brief nod. Then, with Tom leading, we made our way in silence down to the Embassy "safe room", a small basement room enclosed in an electronic shield in which one could talk without fear of being bugged... A day or so later, as I was crossing the courtyard (at home), I was intercepted by one of the first secretaries from the embassy, who handed me a folded piece of paper. "From the ambassador," he said, adding in a low voice, "better put it down the loo when you've read it." I opened the paper and saw that it contained a single typewritten sentence: "London advises break off contact." In my role as Moscow correspondent I have never had to scribble secret notes to embassy officials or participate in drinking sessions with secret agents. And yet, 50 years on, Moscow correspondents are still chasing spy stories. After all, espionage didn't end when the Cold War did. Like most foreign journalists in Moscow at the time, De Mauny assumed that his apartment was bugged. As frustrating as that may have been for his family, this created comical situations. During a visit to Moscow by the BBC's director general, Hugh Greene, and the head of BBC foreign liaison, Donald Stephenson, the correspondent invited his bosses - and British ambassador Sir Humphrey Trevelyan - back to his flat for a drink. Suddenly, Donald caught my eye. "I say, old boy, there's one thing I've been meaning to ask," he said. "Is it true that Mrs Furtseva is Khrushchev's mistress?" Before I could utter a word, Sir Humphrey had cut in. "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture," he said firmly. "Yes, I know," said Donald, not to be put off, "but is she Khrushchev's mistress?" The ambassador directed his gaze at the ceiling, and, this time in loud, decisive tones, once more declared: "Mrs Furtseva is the Soviet Minister of Culture!" I saw Donald open his mouth, as if to make a further try. Then, fortunately, the penny dropped. There was a moment of embarrassed silence, and we turned to other topics. It was from the Central Telegraph Office on Gorky Street that Erik de Mauny filed many of his stories. This sprawling construction was the communications hub of the Soviet Union - people came here to send telegrams, telexes, letters and to make long-distance calls. De Mauny would often book telephone lines to London hours in advance. At the allotted time he would turn up, go into a booth and voice his despatch. At least, that was the theory. But sometimes the lines never came up. This happened so often that de Mauny even wrote to the Soviet communications minister to complain. Since then, of course, technology has moved on. Today the Moscow correspondent can use his smart phone to broadcast live radio in quality, even to transmit TV pictures. As for the Central Telegraph, you can still send telegrams from there. But all those old Soviet telephone booths have been ripped out and replaced by a bank and a cafe. I checked out the cafe. The food is adequate, but not as exotic as some of the delicacies de Mauny was treated to in the 1960s. All foreign correspondents and the entire diplomatic corp based in Moscow would get invited to lavish banquets at the Kremlin. De Mauny interpreted it as an attempt by Khrushchev to impress the outside world: The chosen guests and members of the politburo were grouped behind the top table, while the rest of us circulated between the two long side tables. All three tables were lavishly laden with the most succulent dishes imaginable, from mounds of the finest Iranian caviar from the southern Caspian - plump globules of grey imperial malosol in crystal dishes surrounded by crushed ice - to great platters of smoked salmon and sturgeon... Meanwhile, waiters hurried among the guests with trays of delicious hot snacks, ice-cream and champagne, coffee and Armenian cognac. The Moscow correspondent today has fewer opportunities to dine in such decadence at the heart of Russian power. But, on the positive side, he has far more options for eating out than de Mauny ever did - today Moscow is awash with cafes, coffee shops and restaurants. The supermarkets are better stocked, too, and many of them are open round the clock. The Soviet concept of "defitsit" or "shortage" has, thankfully, passed into history. Erik de Mauny spent three years in Moscow. During that time he covered such momentous events as the first woman cosmonaut in space and Nikita Khrushchev's fall from power. In 1966 he left Moscow and moved to the BBC's Paris bureau. But six years later he was back in the USSR for a second stint. In 1974 he reported the arrest of the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Only hours before, de Mauny had recorded Solzhenitsyn reading from his book, Gulag Archipelago. Now he needed to get that tape to London, fast. And it was de Mauny's wife Elizabeth, a fellow journalist, who came up with an ingenious solution. In a souvenir shop she bought a cassette recording of the Red Army choir. She took out the tape and put the Solzhenitsyn recording in its place. Then a family friend who was returning to London smuggled it out. Collectively they had beaten the system - with a little help from the Soviet military's finest voices. Having read de Mauny's memoirs, I'm struck both by what has changed in Russia over the last 50 years and by what hasn't. As a foreign correspondent based in Moscow, Erik de Mauny wasn't allowed to travel more than a few miles out of the Soviet capital without permission from the Soviet authorities. I have much more freedom to move around, although even today some parts of the country are still off-limits to me. And yet today, just like in 1963, dealing with officialdom can be problematic. I sense that many officials continue to view Western journalists with deep suspicion. De Mauny wrote that there were "so many contradictions between the warmth and generosity of individual friends and the sheer heartlessness of the system". That rings true now today. Russians who don't fit in with "the system" or who openly criticise it run the risk of being identified as troublemakers, even enemies of Russia. But there is one story in Russia today which I'm certain Erik de Mauny would have gained great pleasure and pride from telling. And it's 700 miles east of Moscow. I fly to the city of Perm in the Ural Mountains and attend a rehearsal at the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre. This is one of the oldest and most successful musical theatres in Russia. And the general manager and executive producer here is Marc de Mauny, the son of the BBC's first Moscow correspondent. Marc was just three when his father's second posting to Moscow ended in 1974. But, years later, he would return to study music at the St Petersburg Conservatory. He became fascinated by Russia, just like his father. "My father loved Russian culture, literature and music, and I think, unwittingly, he passed that on to me," Marc says. "I didn't wake up to that until I was 16 or 17 and wondering where to go for my gap year and what to study at university. And it came to me in a blinding flash that I'd like to study Russian and travel in Russia and discover this country which I'd heard so much about from my father. But I had grown up with Russia and the Soviet Union very much present as this vast, mysterious land. It was an emotional involvement. Russia is an emotional place." In a tiny practice room, spellbound, I watch a soloist putting heart and soul into a piece from Madame Butterfly. And I have to agree - Russia is an emotional place. This is a country of big hearts, great talents. But also huge problems and deep disappointments. Russia is beauty and beast. For the Moscow correspondent the challenge was, and always will be, to paint a complete picture. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>How two trademarked apples are changing tastes</description>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was £1.95/kg, Cox £1.75/kg and Pink Lady £3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink Lady® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <body>Andrea Begley only won the second series of The Voice in June, but her album is already finished. The 27-year-old says she wants to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor, Leanne Mitchell - who waited a year to release an album, only to see it stall at number 134 in the UK charts. The time constraints mean Begley's debut mostly consists of cover versions, with Bruce Springsteen's Dancing In The Dark and Jake Bugg's Lightning Bolt among the songs to receive an acoustic makeover. But Begley also sings two original songs, including the title track, The Message. The former law student, who has only 10% vision, talked to the BBC about recording her vocals "line by line"; will.i.am's protest at her victory on The Voice (he tweeted he was "sad" and "perplexed"); and how she would change the show next year. Has it been a rush to get your album ready? Obviously, we couldn't plan for what happened beyond the show, because nobody knew what the result was going to be - but I always had ideas in my head about things I'd like to do if I ever did an album. So we started with that kind of blank page and went from there. What we tried to do was get some stuff from the show, and also do covers of songs I have loved over the years. We knew it was important to get out an album before Christmas. Why was that? From the point of view of what happened last year: Everyone knows things didn't go quite as well as they might have done. Leaving the winner's album for so long, it didn't keep the momentum. For me, it was important to make a good job of it, but not take so long that people had forgotten about me. Do you think you got the balance right? Hopefully! I think the album captures different sides of me as an artist. Within the show I only really got to show a certain angle. What do you mean by that? I suppose what I mean is you've only got a certain number of performances, and you've got a time limit as well. I guess, for me, beyond the show it's great to show I can sing all kinds of things. How long was the time limit? It's quite short. One of them was 1 minute 10 seconds. You find ways and means around it. It's all in the edit - picking out the bits people like to listen to. But there's no doubt about it, you are under a constraint. It's nice to have the luxury of doing a full song on the album! Your audition song (Sarah McLachlan's Angel) is on the album. How far in advance did you decide to perform it on the show? Pretty much from the get-go. As soon as I met the production team, I said: 'This is the kind of song I'd like to do. It isn't too over-played, it isn't too well-known, but it suits my style and I can sing it very well.' I very much nailed my colours to the mast with that song - and it bore out in the end. It really worked. A lot of people, including will.i.am, said they were disappointed you beat Leah McFall. How did that make you feel? Music is subjective and everyone has their own opinion. You'll always get people who'll prefer my music to what Leah or Will are into. The thing is, I love all kinds of music. I love the stuff that Will does, so it was never case of me versus them. Will's tweet is very much in the past. He spoke to me afterwards and said 'look, it's just because I wanted my act to win, and I would have supported you if you'd been my act'. Some people suggested you won because you're visually impaired. Was that a shock? It's a little bit disappointing, I guess, if people go down the route of saying I only won because I had a story. That's not giving the public the credit it's due. People don't vote for those reasons - it's a singing show, at the end of the day, and I was there on the same basis as everyone else. I never, ever tried to make out that I was there because I was visually impaired. Did your law degree come in handy when you were reading your recording contract? [Laughs] It's always helpful, in the sense that it keeps your wits about you. But my experience was a long way off the world of showbusiness. How does singing in the studio compare to live performances? It's very different. Studio days are tiring because you're standing in front of a microphone for hours on end. People don't realise how meticulous it is. You record everything line by line by line by line. But then, when you hear it back, you realise how much you need to focus on each individual part to get it right. Your aunt is country singer Philomena Begley. Did she give you any tips? I've had quite a lot of contact with my aunt in the past couple of months, and she's been keeping me advised of songs, and things I should watch out for. She's very excited about the album coming out. There's a little bit of country on it, so she'll be happy with that. What did she tell you to watch out for? Just to make sure I get my opinions across. I'm always pretty determined anyway, and I speak my mind. So I definitely did that. What was the biggest argument you had? Did you have to pull a diva strop? Not yet - but I'm working on it. I want a newborn kitten in every dressing room! You played a concert with Evelyn Glennie for people with sensory disabilities in over the summer. What was that like? It was done in conjunction with the RNIB and Action for Hearing Loss. My set was made accessible to people with hearing loss by having sign interpreters there, so I just had to make sure I stuck to the set list and did all the lyrics in the correct order! It's easy to assume that people with hearing loss wouldn't get anything from a concert, but I guess there's a visceral, physical element to live music. Of course, and obviously you've got all the visual aspects of watching the band. If you've got some level of hearing, you can pick up some of the concert and enjoy it. It's the same for me if I go to see a film. I won't necessarily get all the visuals, but it's still an experience - going out to the cinema and the big screen, and all that. Has going to the cinema become more accessible with things like audio description? It's definitely improving, although audio description is nowhere near the level I think it should be. Someone asked me recently what I felt was the single biggest problem for people with visual impairment. From my point of view, I'd like to get people to understand what visual impairment is, so that if they come across someone with a stick or a dog, that they know not to freak out or ask silly questions. Does that happen a lot? I run into it very rarely, but you do get it sometimes. People have come up and shouted loudly at me. They must have thought my ears didn't work, as well as my eyes! Finally - what do you think of the new line-up on The Voice? I'm excited. It's good to give it a fresh look. I know some people think Danny and Jessie leaving might be a little too much disruption. But the new setting will keep viewers' interest alive. Everybody wants to see what kind of banter there'll be between the new coaches. If you were auditioning this year, whose team would you want to be on? I don't know! Possibly Tom, or Kylie. I think will.i.am's going to have a lot of competition from her. She has a sparkle and personality that'll be really good for the show. And if they put you in charge, what would you change? For me, definitely, the knock-out rounds were absolutely horrendous. So I'd make them do two knock-out rounds, just to be a little bit devious. You'd make it harder! I'd just like to fully test them. See if they're up to the challenge. Andrea Begley's album, The Message, is out on Monday, 21 October. </body>

      <title>Alps murders: new witness speaks</title>
      <description>A new witness to the al-Hilli killings speaks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24476627</url>
      <date>1382314838</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70585000/png/_70585906_screenshot2013-10-18at15.27.12.png</thumbnail>
      <body>A witness who claims to have seen the car thought to have been involved in the murders of three members of a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps last September, has spoken publicly for the first time. A forestry worker has told the BBC's Panorama programme he saw a British dark grey BMW shortly before the attack. We drive through the sleepy village of Chevaline up a narrow road leading high into the Alps. Rounding the corner we pull over at a parking spot called Le Martinet, hidden beneath the tree canopy. The mountains are shrouded in mist and amidst the rush of the stream and chatter of birds, it is hard to imagine the horror of what happened in this idyllic spot. Three members of the al-Hilli family - a father, mother and grandmother - were murdered at point blank range here. A seven-year-old child was left for dead and her four-year-old sister was so traumatised she was only discovered hiding underneath her dead mother's skirt in the back of the car eight hours after the emergency services arrived. Only Zaid al-Hilli, the brother of the driver of the car, has ever been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. He denies arranging the murders and is on bail. He has not been charged. I have come back to the scene with a British cyclist who discovered the crime to find out exactly what happened. Brett Martin, a former RAF pilot who has a holiday home in the area, set off for a cycle ride in the early afternoon of 5 September 2012. "I left the house at about 14:30 [with] no fixed route in my mind," he said. "It was sunny… [and] quite a peaceful, pleasant afternoon." He took the same narrow road up the mountain. Ahead of him was a French cyclist. On his way up he was overtaken by a vehicle which he believes was the al-Hilli's car. According to French police, the Al Hillis reached Le Martinet at about 15:40, having passed the French cyclist. Saad al-Hilli got out of the car with his seven year old daughter, Zainab. In less than a minute, Saad and his wife Iqbal, from Surrey, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, and the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, had been fatally shot. Zainab had been wounded but the gunman ran out of bullets and clubbed her with his gun. She survived but all she has been able to tell investigators about the killer is that she saw 'one bad man'. Coming up the hill at about 15:45, Brett Martin saw the motorcyclist escaping. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he said. When he arrived at the scene, Mr Martin initially thought he had come across a traffic accident. Realising there had been a shooting, he feared for his own life. "I was thinking is there a hunter, a sniper kind of character, hiding in the trees, maybe shooting from a covered position? "I was thinking to myself, I wonder if this is going to be painful when I get shot?" Mr Martin tried to call the emergency services but could not get a signal. After checking on the little girl he went for help. No culprit has been found and French police admit they have no evidence as to who the hitman and his accomplices were. But Panorama has tracked down a witness who suggests the killer was not acting alone. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting has never spoken publicly before. He drove me along the same route but does not want to be identified for fear of the killer still at large. "When I arrived there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here," he said. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." He also saw a British car driven by someone who seems to have been an accomplice. "He arrived on the left and he passed really quickly. The car was a BMW 4x4, X5, grey metallic, in good condition. "It was a right hand drive, English. I didn't get much of a look at him but the driver was slightly bald and he had dark skin, no glasses." Ten minutes later, two of his colleagues driving down the same road saw the motorbike up the hill from the parking area beyond where motor vehicles were not allowed to go. "They told me they passed the motorbike I had passed at Place Martinet - two bends further up. "They had words with him because motor vehicles aren't allowed. So they called out to him and asked him to drive down. They saw his face because he lifted his helmet...he had a bit of a beard." This seems to suggest that at least two people acted together - one carrying out surveillance, the other the hitman. The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said there is no evidence as to who the hitman or his accomplices were. In less than a minute, 21 bullets were fired with great accuracy, leading investigators to wonder whether the attack was a contract killing carried out by someone in the criminal underworld. French police have traced all the vehicles in the area that day except two - the motorbike and the grey four-by-four. They are still searching for them. The terrible events he witnessed have not stopped Brett Martin from riding his bike up the same road when he visits his holiday home. But the events of that day will always be with him. "It's a mystery. Perplexing, unsolved, [it's] one of those Agatha Christie 'whodunit' scenarios."

      <title>Jerusalem: Communities up-close</title>
      <description>The Holy City through the eyes of its citizens</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24567567</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70560000/jpg/_70560067_1382094566_tmp_jerusalem_promo.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Jerusalemites are preparing to cast their vote - or abstain in protest - in municipal elections. The city is home to the world's major religions and a host of social, political and economic issues. Here, the BBC's Erica Chernofsky looks at some of Jerusalem's diverse communities and the matters which concern them. Oh, Jerusalem. The holy city, the city of gold, the city of peace. One of the oldest cities in the world, it has been conquered and reconquered, rebuilt and destroyed, for centuries. Every stone has a story, every olive tree a history, and every mountain a different name, depending on who you ask. The city today is a vibrant mosaic of both ancient and modern. From the Old City walls overlooking dusty souks to the state-of-the-art light rail rushing past the upscale shops and five-star hotels of the Mamilla promenade, Jerusalem's ethnic landscape reflects the diversity of its population, a growing melting pot of Israeli society. Despite its charm, Jerusalem is also a source of bitter disputes. It is a divided city, part Arab, part Jewish, and its ownership is still fought over, as ever. Both Israel and the Palestinians claim it as the capital of their nations. Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later annexed it, but the international community does not recognise this sovereignty. According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Jerusalem is Israel's largest city, but also one of the poorest, with higher unemployment rates than the national average. There are a lot of issues that come with living in Jerusalem, and many of its residents feel the voices of their communities are not being heard. Masada Porat is the first ultra-Orthodox, or haredi, woman to run for the local city council. The ultra-Orthodox community constitutes about a third of Jerusalem's Jewish population, and as such wields plenty of power over local life. There was another haredi woman in the running, but she eventually backed out after reportedly receiving threats against her and her family from within her own community. Ultra-Orthodox society is very closed and insulated against the outside world. The men dress in traditional 19th Century religious garb and devote their lives to Torah study, while the women are required to dress very modestly and are mainly responsible for childrearing and supporting the household. It is strongly frowned upon for a woman to draw attention by placing herself in the public spotlight, and the campaign has been a difficult one for Mrs Porat. There is another sector of Jerusalem society battling to have its voice heard, but most of its population won't even be voting. The Palestinians of East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and therefore cannot vote in national elections. But they are officially residents of the city, and as such have the right to vote in local elections. However, most of them will be boycotting the polls out of protest against the Israeli occupation and what they say is discrimination against their community by local government. Khaled Saheb owns a small denim shop in the Old City souk just inside Damascus Gate. He used to be a microbiologist, but took over his family's business after his father died. He complains that living conditions are much worse on the eastern side of the city than on the western, mostly Jewish, side, and longs for a day when the Palestinians will be able to govern themselves in a state of their own. Making Jerusalem more enjoyable for its residents has become almost like a mission for Dor Sircovich, owner of the popular local pub Bolinat and part of the city's decreasing secular population. Many secular people complain that the city is becoming too religious, and resent the encroachment of ultra-Orthodox families on their neighbourhoods. Large numbers of secular residents, including many friends of Mr Sircovich, have been leaving for more liberal places like Tel Aviv. But he is determined to stay. His pub serves non-kosher food and is open on the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat), therefore serving only the city's non-religious public. Shabbat in Jerusalem means almost everything is closed down from Friday afternoon to Saturday evening. Dor Sircovich wishes there was more entertainment spots like his, more places open on Shabbat, and less religious power over city life. He hopes that the city's religious and non-religious population can find a way to live together in harmony, and to that end is even planning to open up a kosher restaurant, right next to his non-kosher pub, so that both groups can have common ground to connect and interact. For now, the city remains divided, along a lot of different political, religious and ideological lines. It remains to be seen if a new local council can make any significant change in one of the most loved and contested cities in the world. Video by Alon Farago; Photographs by Noam Sharon </body>

      <title>Co-op Group to lose control of Co-op Bank</title>
      <description>Co-op Group's hopes of keeping control of rescued Co-op Bank dashed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24605864</url>

      <body>Co-op Group's hopes of retaining control of Co-op Bank after its £1.5bn rescue have been dashed by opposition from creditors, led by a duo of hedge funds, I understand. But Co-op Group hopes the bank's co-operative ethos can be protected. Co-op Bank is also expected to announce later today that its provisions for the costs of compensating customers for mis-selling PPI insurance or for flaws in lending documentation, inter alia, will be around £100m greater than it expected. Or to put it another way, a bank that has taken itself to the brink of collapse because of the scale of losses, from loans going bad and an expensive IT project that had to be written off, turns out to be even more loss making than was thought. However I am told that the banks' supervisor, the Prudential Regulation Authority, has concluded that the amount of new capital needed by Co-op Bank to remain viable does not need to be increased from the £1.5bn agreed in the summer. So the challenge for Co-op Bank of staying alive remains what it was (and see what I wrote here a couple of days ago for more on this). However, after a weekend of intensive talks with Co-op Bank's creditors, Co-op Group, owner of Co-op Bank, has conceded - or so I am told - that its own plan for rescuing the bank has to be torn up and replaced. Co-op Group's original plan involved it putting in £1bn of the capital needed by Co-op Bank, with bondholders and owners of preference shares contributing the remaining £500m. Under this proposal, Co-op Bank would have been floated on the London Stock Exchange, but Co-op Group would have retained control of it with a 70% stake. This deal cannot go ahead without the agreement of the bondholders and owners of preference shares, and they've told Co-op Group they reject it. The most important opposition to what Co-op Group wanted came from owners of 43% of "lower-tier-two-capital" bonds - or lenders to the bank with greater rights over Co-op Bank's assets than other bondholders. The leaders of these opponents were a couple of hedge funds, Silver Point and Aurelius, advised by investment bank Moelis. These hedge funds favoured a plan in which their bonds would be converted largely into Co-op Bank shares, which would give the bondholders ownership and control of the bank. Under this alternative rescue, the banks would still be listed on the London Stock Exchange. The hedge funds are getting their way. Under a revised rescue plan, it is the bondholders - which also include insurers and pension funds - which would end up controlling Co-op Bank. At the time of writing, that revised plan has not been formally agreed. But I am told it is likely to be finalised over the coming week - with an announcement on the detail likely next Monday. Under any new rescue deal, Co-op Group would retain a stake, but it would be less than the 50% necessary for Co-op Group to boss the bank. Institutional investors, led by hedge funds, would collectively be the majority owners. This conversion of Co-op Bank into just another bank owned by professional investors has the potential to fundamentally alter the bank's ethos and culture, I am told that the hedge funds recognise that such perceived cultural change would be a bad thing, because they see there would be a risk of Co-op Bank being deserted by hundreds of thousands of customers who choose it because they see it as a more ethical bank than the others. So as part of any rescue, the bank's co-operative and ethical underpinnings are expected to be written into the bank's governing principles. Meanwhile it is hoped that the structure of the new deal will placate another group unhappy with Co-op Group's original proposals, namely thousands of individuals who invested in the bank's preference shares and perpetual subordinated bonds. Under the Co-op Group's rescue plan, holders of these perpetual subordinated bonds and preference shares would have received ordinary shares in the new bank in exchange for their bonds and preference shares - because that was the conventional way of forcing a financial sacrifice on investors very low down the food chain of creditors (the perpetual subordinated bonds and preference shares have less claim on Co-op Bank's assets than the lower-tier-2-capital holders). This would have caused considerable hardship for many of these individuals, because their existing Co-op Bank investments pay a handsome income, whereas the new Co-op Bank shares would probably pay little or no income for many years. So there has been a public campaign against what Co-op Group was proposing by these small investors, co-ordinated by Mark Taber. Co-op Group has been insisting it has been trying to protect the interests of the retail investors. And it looks as though they have won some kind of victory, because the revised rescue deal will - breaking with convention - offer them income-paying bonds. Meanwhile the hedge funds and lower-tier-2-capital owners will receive mainly shares, because they want direct ownership of a bank that they believe can be restored to health and turned into a valuable business over three to five years. The hedge funds and other institutional investors are also expected to invest tens of millions of pounds of their own money in Co-op Bank, to boost its capital and reinforce their control of the bank. As I wrote on Friday, however, if no rescue can be agreed voluntarily, control of the bank would temporarily be seized by the Bank of England, under a process called resolution. The Bank would then protect the interests of depositors by forcing big losses on Co-op Group and obliging the bank's bondholders to convert their loans to the bank into loss-absorbing shares on terms regarded by the Bank of England as fair. </body>

      <title>Making the case for 'Yes'</title>
      <description>Alex Salmond's speech was droll and pragmatic, says Brian Taylor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24597301</url>

      <body>Alex Salmond may have lost a few pounds (he is apparently on the same diet as Beyonce.) However, our newly svelte FM has plainly lost none of his comic timing. The gags themselves were modestly droll but the delivery was impeccable. Admittedly, it was scarcely a tough house. No sense here of the Glasgow Empire on a wet Thursday. They were ready to laugh, they were ready to applaud, they were more than ready to cheer. And they duly did all three. There was, of course, substance too: not least the date on which the White Paper will emerge. This document will form the prospectus upon which people in Scotland will be voting (although, as the UK government points out, independence would require negotiation beyond a Yes vote, plus a Bill through Westminster.) Along with the publication date, we learned a little more about that White Paper. It will have two sections.... Mr Salmond said the aim would be to create both a prosperous country and a just society. And certainly he stressed the importance of enterprise, the need to compete globally. But the substance of his address was weighted towards egalitarianism. For example, the major announcement was about potentially enhancing the minimum wage. In part, this matches the Scottish mood which is traditionally more communitarian. But there is a pragmatic purpose too. For Alex Salmond to secure a Yes vote in the referendum, he needs to recruit votes from the dispossessed and struggling, from Labour voters and those disenchanted with politics entirely. Hence this pitch. On which, one might note the debate earlier today in which delegates agreed to examine the economic proposals contained in the Common Weal paper published by the Jimmy Reid Foundation. The resolution as amended noted that an independent Scotland "may wish to adopt" these proposals. As with other resolutions, this was carried by acclaim. I gather that there had been an expectation that someone would challenge this, suggesting at the very least that the resolution might be remitted. The advice, apparently, was that this would simply provoke division - and draw more attention to the issue than was thought to be warranted. To be clear - and this was stressed by speakers in the debate - the Common Weal prospectus is not SNP policy. However, examination of its content with a view to possible adoption is now a declared party objective. Those who are interested can read the full detail on the Foundation's own website. But, in essence, it argues for a Nordic approach to the economy and social policy: including an emphasis upon equality, the prospect of public ownership where justified and a higher percentage of GDP taken in tax (although it is noted further that wages overall might be higher, resulting in a net gain in living standards.) When I interviewed Angus Robertson for our conference webcast, he was keen to talk about Nordic egalitarianism but preferred to emphasise economic growth rather than higher taxation. Memories perhaps of a "Penny for Scotland", the previous SNP proposal to use Holyrood's Tartan Tax power which failed to enthuse the electorate. More of which later as the White Paper emerges. Back to Alex Salmond's speech. This was a potent performance by an experienced politician on form. It was well timed. Well structured. It featured the now familiar syllogism: Holyrood has produced devolved policies in tune with Scotland; by contrast, Westminster generates policies out of synch with Scottish thinking; turn to full independence. Mr Salmond's opponents, of course, say that is logically fallacious. That there is no automatic read-through from devolution to independence, that the Union remains valid and valuable. On to the White Paper. On to the referendum. </body>

      <body>The number of places at UK universities will have to grow by at least a quarter over the next 20 years, the universities minister has warned. David Willetts says in a paper for the Social Market Foundation that the number of places needs to grow from 368,000 to 460,000 to meet demand. Universities have seen a squeeze on places in recent years, with thousands of students failing to get on courses. The primary school place shortage could go on to hit undergraduates, he says. The paper from the universities minister is billed as his projection of the future of higher education in the UK. It seeks to update a report written 50 years ago when just 5% of young people went to university. The Robbins report called for and led to a bold expansion in university places. It rested on the guiding principle that higher education should be open to all able and qualified enough to go. Robbins considered what the demand was likely to be over the next 20 years - based on the number of suitably qualified young people, not economic forecasts of future jobs. The projections in Mr Willetts's pamphlet follow this model and suggests there will be a need for 92,000 more places for England-based students in UK universities in the next 20 years. He says the current demographic backdrop is very different to the 1960s, when the country was in the grip of a baby boom, because of the fall in the number of babies born in the 1990s. But he adds: "However, looking ahead to the 2020s, we can see the increase in the number of births since the turn of the century feeding through into more young people. Those pressures have already been felt in our nurseries and primary schools." He also argues that as educational standards in England improve over the coming years, there will be a greater supply of young people with the potential to go to university, thus increasing demand still further. And he goes on to highlight differences between the English higher education system and European ones, hinting at a more liberal approach. He also says: "The English system is quite unusual amongst advanced countries for having such selective systems of entry to university... Other countries allow virtually automatic progression to your local university if you have the requisite qualifications." Although the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has introduced more flexibility in the system, with universities being allowed to recruit unlimited numbers of brighter students (those gaining certain high grades), overall the numbers have remained fairly static since 2010. But it is expected numbers will begin to recover again this coming year when admissions quotas for individual universities are being relaxed. When the Robbins report was published in 1963 there were nearly 216,000 full-time students in higher education. Robbins projected this number would grow to 558,000 by 1980-81. Director of the Social Market Foundation Emran Mian said: "David Willetts provides a compelling case for expanding higher education. This is our best bet for equipping the UK economy with the skills it needs and improving social mobility." The report stops short of saying how such demand will be met. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the pamphlet was Mr Willetts's personal view but would not comment further. </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <title>School gates smokers abuse principal</title>
      <description>A head teacher in south London is targeted for abuse after asking parents to stop smoking outside the school gates.</description>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. "I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>Child psychologist provision warning</title>
      <description>A national steering group warns that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low.</description>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

      <title>Tories reject Clegg free school plan</title>
      <description>Tory education minister Elizabeth Truss rejects calls by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for tighter controls on free schools in England.</description>

      <body>Conservative education minister Elizabeth Truss has rejected Liberal Democrat calls for tighter controls on free schools in England. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the schools should employ only qualified teachers and adhere to the national curriculum. He said this was so parents could be sure their children were receiving a high standard of education. Mrs Truss said it was a "shame" some Lib Dems did not back free schools. She said the "whole point" of the schools "is they have these freedoms... that's what's helping them outperform maintained schools". "You shouldn't kill off the goose that's laid the golden egg," she said. Mrs Truss noted that independent schools "operate well" without being made to hire qualified teachers and have done so "for hundreds of years". Mr Clegg has denied his comments represented a "great coalition crisis" ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister told Sky News they were part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" Last week, the head teacher of a free primary school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the al-Madinah free school in Derby was judged by the education watchdog Ofsted to be "inadequate". In his speech, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." The deputy prime minister told Sky News he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local council control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. On Sunday, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Michael Gove and David Cameron's divisive Free Schools programme is unravelling for all to see. "But Nick Clegg is locked-in to this failure too. It is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the al-Madinah Free School earlier, the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141% rise in unqualified teachers since 2010." A Department for Education spokesman argued that free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He said the government was not going to take away the freedom free schools have for teachers to "set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job". </body>

      <title>Teacher jobs scheme 'going well'</title>
      <description>Organisers of a scheme to give short-term employment to hundreds of newly-qualified teachers say they are pleased at the number who have been appointed.</description>

      <body>Organisers of a scheme to give short-term employment to hundreds of newly-qualified teachers in Northern Ireland have said they are pleased at the number who have been appointed. Almost 270 two-year posts have been created to help improve literacy and numeracy standards in deprived areas. While almost 200 posts have been allocated, about 70 remain unfilled. The scheme is open to young teachers who graduated within the last three years but do not have permanent jobs. In May, the Western Education and Library Board was given the task of matching schools with the graduates. Alison Smyth of the Western Board said they hoped to advertise again and appoint more teachers after the Halloween mid-term break. "We have been interviewing the young teachers, and it's great that we're in the position now to have so many of them employed," she said. Some head teachers have expressed concern that the graduate teachers are not all yet in place. Stephen McConkey of Hollybank Primary School in Monkstown said: "I appreciate it's a difficult and time-consuming exercise. However, any school would have liked to see these teachers on-site by the end of August or start of September." All post-primary, non-selective schools have been allocated at least one new teacher, and selected primary schools were targeted to give children extra help with reading, writing and mathematics. However, the two-year period paid for by the Department of Education will end in August 2015, even if the graduate teachers do not start work until weeks or months into the school year. One graduate who has been employed as part of the scheme said it would boost his chances of getting a permanent job. David Kearney, who was recruited by Hollybank Primary School, said: "Unfortunately the nature of supply work is that it's not guaranteed, and there were times you were waiting for a phone call. "This is not a long-term fix but it's great to give young teachers a chance to develop their skills. "It puts us in a better position to apply for permanent jobs in the future." </body>

      <title>Teachers' Oscar for Japanese lessons</title>
      <description>A teacher who has introduced Japanese lessons is among this year's winners of the national teachers' awards.</description>

      <body>A teacher who has brought Japanese to the West Country is one of the winners of this year's teachers' awards. The so-called "teachers' Oscar" for secondary teacher of the year has been won by Crispin Chambers of Tavistock College, a comprehensive in Devon. The languages teacher was praised for his inspirational lessons, high results and for building links with Japan. His local mayor says the town should erect a statue to him in recognition of his achievements as a teacher. There are 1,200 pupils studying Japanese at the secondary school, from Year 7 to A-level, which makes it one of the biggest Japanese departments in the country. The school has an annual exchange visit to Tokyo and the Japanese embassy has described Mr Chambers as a "trailblazer" for promoting the language. Mr Chambers says that when the idea of teaching Japanese was launched in the 1990s, no-one expected it to work. Languages such as Japanese and Chinese were seen as something more likely to be taught to the most able pupils in independent schools. He says that the challenge has been to make it accessible to all ability groups - and now there are about 50 to 60 people taking the subject at GCSE each year, with outstanding grades. As well sending students to study Japanese at university, Mr Chambers says that speaking Japanese is a huge advantage in the jobs market, in areas such as banking, medicine or law. There have been many warnings about the UK's poor level of language skills, but Mr Chambers says that it is possible to "capture the imagination" with languages and to show students there is a real value to learning a language. Mr Chambers's first experience of teaching was in Japan and he says he was captivated by the respect shown to teachers and that it was seen as a "pleasure to study". "Parents would thank you in the street for teaching their children," he says. The role of teaching in the UK also needs to be recognised for its importance, he says. "One teacher can be the dominant feature in someone's life," he says. There were 24,000 nominations for this year's Pearson Teaching Awards, which were launched in 1998 to celebrate the achievements of the teaching profession. This year's ceremony at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London saw 10 prizes being awarded. Among the famous names handing over prizes was Mo Farah, who has acknowledged the important role PE teacher Alan Watkinson played in developing his athletics career. The winners of the 2013 Pearson Teaching Awards are: The awards ceremony will be shown on BBC Two on Sunday, 27 October at 17:30 in Britain's Classroom Heroes </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Protesters disrupt French schools</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in Paris and other French cities are again disrupted by pupils protesting at the removal of two foreign students from France.</description>

      <body>Schools in Paris and other French cities are being disrupted again by pupil protests over the removal of two foreign students from France. Protesters gathered on the French capital's Bastille square, traditional meeting-place of the left, as some demonstrators clashed with riot police. Divisions have appeared among the ruling Socialists over the affair. It has emerged that the father of a Roma schoolgirl at the centre of the row lied over his asylum claim. However, the anger in France has focused on the way Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was removed from a school bus to be expelled along with her family earlier this month. They had been living in the eastern region of Doubs for several years. While President Francois Hollande has remained silent, his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, spoke out on Friday to question the girl's treatment. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has defended the authorities' tough line and takes a tough policy towards Roma immigrants in general. The minister has cut short an official visit to the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to return to Paris, where findings of an inquiry into the handling of the affair are expected to be ready shortly. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the family will be allowed to return if "any fault is found" with the expulsion order. There is also anger over the removal of Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia after being arrested for shoplifting, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally. Police fired tear gas at some protesters in Paris but the demonstration in the Nation-Bastille area appeared to be passing off peacefully in the main. Pupils partially blocked entry to as many as 20 secondary schools in Paris while allowing other pupils to enter to attend classes, the pupils' union Fidl said. Outside one school in central Paris, the Lycee Charlemagne, wheelie bins were used to block the entrance. A banner read "Jotters not [ID] papers". One protester at the school, named as David, told Reuters: "We're a bit lost, we say our country is the country of human rights, a country which welcomes people and we still deport a 15-year-old girl and a 19-year-old student to a country... that they don't know and where they have no future." There appeared to be less protest activity in other French cities but some schools were affected in Marseille, Lyon and Rouen. Speaking on a visit to Angers, Ms Trierweiler said "certain boundaries cannot be crossed" and "the school gate is one of them". Education Minister Vincent Peillon told French radio that it was wrong for the authorities to have detained the girl while she was on a trip. "What is certain is that when one is in the setting of a class outing, and that was the case, you are part of school life... and you can't intervene during that time," he said. "That means schools are kind of a sanctuary." Opinion polls suggest Mr Valls is the most popular member of President Hollande's government with the wider public. His critics point to the fact that he himself was born in Spain. However, he was naturalised in France more than 20 years ago. Leonarda Dibrani and her family have been given a flat and a small allowance in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, where they have been speaking to French journalists about the shock of being sent to a region where they are strangers, unable to speak Albanian. Resat Dibrani told media in Kosovo, where he and his family were expelled, that he had lied to the French authorities when he said his family was from the breakaway Serbian region. In fact, only he was born there while, according to him, his daughter Leonarda and other members of his family were born in Italy. "We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo," he told Reuters news agency. It emerged in France that the father was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Khatchik Kachatryan spoke by phone from his home village in Armenia on Friday to say he had been forced on to a plane on Saturday after having his hands and feet bound and being gagged. The allegation could not be verified independently. He told French broadcaster BFMTV that he now faced having to do two years' military service in Armenia. This is the standard term for conscripts. </body>

      <body>More than 60 parents had asked Derby City Council about moving their children out of the Al-Madinah free school before a damning Ofsted report was released, the BBC has learned. The figures pre-date the report, which said the school was failing in all areas and was "dysfunctional". Enquiries were made by 67 parents, with 33 making formal applications to put their children elsewhere. The school said it accepted the findings and would use them to move on. On Thursday, Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were serious problems at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. The Ofsted report said teachers at Al-Madinah were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training and that the school required special measures. Parent Razwana Bibiakbar said she would not be taking her child out of the school but added that it had let the pupils down. She said: "Something has to be done [like bringing] new leadership, new team, new staff - qualified - into Al-Madinah school to run it properly. "Why should I pull my daughter out of that school? Why can't they pull their socks up and fix everything?" The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby on Thursday that the Al-Madinah situation should not be used as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement. </body>

      <title>'Boost family learning in schools'</title>
      <description>Millions of children are being held back by their parents' poor educational attainment, suggests a report.</description>

      <body>Millions of children in England and Wales are held back by their parents' poor basic skills, suggests a report. Involving the whole family in learning can boost educational attainment across generations and should be integral to schools says the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Governments should give family learning more support, the report says. England is "a nation in crisis" as far as skills are concerned said inquiry chairwoman Baroness Howarth. "Adults whose parents have low levels of education are eight times more likely to have poor proficiency in literacy than adults whose parents had higher levels of education," writes Valerie Howarth in her foreword. "Surely it is a moral outrage that a nation such as ours should be in this position." The report draws on a recent OECD study which found that adults in England score among the lowest results in international literacy and numeracy tests when compared with the same age group in other industrialised countries. The OECD study, published earlier in October, found England was 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. The NIACE team also looked at research from national and local government, Ofsted and from educational, family and children's charities. They found "particularly compelling evidence that family language and maths programmes benefit children's skills as well as those of their parents and carers". They also found evidence of wider benefits from improving adults' confidence and self-esteem to reducing ill health, unemployment and re-offending. NIACE urges head teachers to fund family learning through the Pupil Premium which is paid to schools to support the attainment of pupils on free school meals or in care. It also calls for government departments to work together to support family learning and to ensure that there is enough funding to meet demand. David Hughes, chief executive of NIACE said: "Imagine growing up in a home where there are no books, no stories and where your parents don't have the confidence to help you with your homework. "Unfortunately that is a reality for too many children - but this situation can be overcome. "Across the country there are examples of family learning programmes which have transformed the prospects of adults and children. "But these programmes should not be the exception, they need to be the norm in every school and community." A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said the government already supported adults to improve English and maths skills, whether or not they were in work, fully funding GCSE and other qualifications. "We support a wide range of provision so that adults can participate in learning in the way that suits them, including community learning, traditional college courses and online learning." The government also supports family learning through the £210m community learning budget to fund a range of flexible courses, including English and maths tailored to individuals' needs and learning styles, said the spokeswoman. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College Leaders said he broadly welcomed the report. "Parents play a hugely important role in their children's success at school, and schools already do a great deal to engage parents and help them to support their children. "There are a lot of examples of good practice already in schools around the country to draw on. "It is a two-way street however, and while schools can offer opportunities parents have to be willing to engage in them. "Sadly some parents can't or won't support their children's learning and in those cases it is incredibly challenging for schools to create family learning links." </body>

      <title>More universities look beyond grades</title>
      <description>More UK universities are using extra and personal information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>More UK universities are using personal and extra information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests. Of the 67 institutions who replied to a survey, 37% said they used such "contextual data" - and most of the remaining ones planned to do so. UK universities are encouraged to use such data to recruit more students from poor homes. University leaders are calling for an informed public debate on the issue. In England, permission to charge tuition fees higher than £6,000 a year is on condition that universities work to attract and recruit more poorer students. Less formal arrangements, also encouraging this move towards "widening participation", are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research carried out by a publicly funded but independent body called Spa (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) looked at what kind of extra information universities were using when making offers to students or deciding whom to admit. It says a survey it carried out of UK universities in November last year found that 37% of those who responded (67 in total) used contextual data and 57% planned to do so. Extra information used (beyond grades and predicted grades) includes personal details put on an application, information about applicants' school or college, the kind of area they live in and whether they have taken part in activities designed to "raise aspirations". Such data is used mostly, Spa found, in considering whether to admit "borderline" pupils at the point when places are confirmed. After that, it is used in clearing - the process run in August to match students to places - to decide whom to offer places to, to interview and to admit. Finally, the researchers say such information is used to consider "whether or not to make a differential offer" - that is, when deciding to make someone an offer at lower grades than is usual because of the potential they show. Contextual data has been used for "many years", according to Spa, but is now "playing an increasing role in strengthening fair admissions and access at all stages of the admissions process". It says more research is needed - as well as more transparency from institutions about their admissions systems. The study says more universities are moving towards a centralised system for admissions, away from individual departments controlling this. Professor Janet Beer, chair of the Spa steering group and vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: "Spa's report brings together, for the first time, the evidence base for using contextualised admissions in the UK higher education sector. "It shows us that this information has an important role to play in ensuring fair access for applicants as well as helping to sustain academic excellence by admitting those who demonstrate the strongest potential to thrive in higher education." Professor Beer added that there was a "growing appetite" among universities for using contextual data, not least because of the more competitive market. Paul Clark, from Universities UK, which represents university leaders, said universities were "driven by the desire to maintain excellence by recruiting the best students for their courses and identifying candidates with the most potential to succeed". "This report shows that increasing numbers of universities are looking to use contextual data to do this," he said. "University can be a life-changing experience. Contextual data is one way of ensuring that anyone with the ability and desire to go to university has the opportunity to do so. "As the report concludes, it is also important that universities are open about their use of contextual data and information. There is a need to have an informed public debate about the merits of using this additional data in the university admissions process." There has been some criticism of the use of such data and accusations that this amounts to "social engineering". Private school heads say they support the "sensible and sensitive" use of such information - as long as it is used fairly. Chris Ramsey, from the HMC which represents leading independent schools and head master of the King's School in Chester, said contextual data was an important part of the admissions process - and his school used it too. "We are not opposed to its use - as long as it is personal to each student, sensitively and sensibly used, and as long as it is not simply blanket bias for or against certain student types - for example, bias for or against students who went to a particular type of school," he said. "Each student deserves to be treated as an individual, not as part of a politically-determined group. "A student who has been, for example, educated at a low-performing school for only part of his or her career, or who is state-educated but from a socially privileged background, should not be advantaged over one who has worked hard or been given a bursary at an independent school." </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-24548690</url>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been described by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <description>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales.</description>

      <body>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales. Two Carmarthenshire primary schools took part in the six week pilot aimed at recognising danger signs in relationships. Hafan Cymru's project had only been used in secondary schools before. The charity said it was so successful the aim was to use it right across Wales. In the pilot, six sessions for 10 and 11 year olds were delivered in the two participating schools and one for parents and training for staff. Gaynor Jones, schools resource officer for Hafan Cymru, said it was the first scheme in Wales they knew of that has been delivered to children across Years 5 and 6. "They've [the pupils] been absolutely brilliant, they've been really open, they've learnt a lot of new ideas," she added. "They've learnt a lot of new vocabulary and I think it's really important that we get that vocabulary out into the public domain. "We're hearing they're discussing it with parents at home as well and that's great, we want those messages to be carried home." Last year a third of Hafan Cymru's service users were aged 16-24, and the organisation feels that preventative work in schools is key to ending domestic abuse in communities. But Ms Jones admits funding is the issue that could prevent the scheme being rolled out wider. And she is hoping that the Welsh government's White Paper about ending violence against women becomes law and will be followed up with funding which is "absolutely vital". "We know that teenagers are getting into abusive relationships younger and younger now," Ms Jones added. "We're developing a peer education project with our service users in Hafan Cymru and one of those women we're working in entered her first abusive relationship when she was 13. "So by the time children are in secondary school, it's not too late. We can still save some hopefully. "But if we can get the message out younger, that's great." Catrin Nicholas, assistant head teacher at Ysgol Llech y Fedach in Tumble, said she had initial concerns about how such a difficult subject could be dealt with but she said the content had been aimed properly at young children. "Once the initial session was over I realised it was going to be all right because it focused on good relationships with others. "It focused on the positive points of that rather than anything too scary or too frightening for pupils who are so young," she said. </body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice. Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke. It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant. Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues. Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises. He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased. "The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said. "We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils." A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced. </body>

      <title>Bright poor 'held back for decades'</title>
      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi.

      <body>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being awarded practical qualifications that have little worth, a report says. Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns. It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects. The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards". The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved. The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level. The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems. Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels. The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330. The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work. And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship. In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor". The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said. "Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said. He said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop. The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels. No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says. Sir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees. "Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice. "England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs." Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do. "The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved. "The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved." A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers. "Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job. "We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month." </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay. Institutions across the UK are expected to be affected by the action, taken by three unions - the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the move. The news comes as teachers plan a strike in parts of England on Thursday. Members of the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT are staging a further regional strike in their continuing row over pay, pensions and workload. The unions planning the university strike for 31 October claim a 1% pay rise offered to staff - including lecturers, technicians and administration workers - means there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison declined to release details of what percentage of its membership had voted. It only said of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay. Quite simply, enough is enough. "We urge the employers to reflect on the fact that they are about to face their first ever strike by three unions at the same time and come to the negotiating table to resolve this dispute. "The suppression of academic pay is one of the most sustained pay cuts since World War II and, while strike action is always a last resort, the fact that staff are prepared to take this step demonstrates just how angry they are." A spokesman for UCEA said: "Employers do understand that the general 1% uplift offered to all may be frustrating to these trade unions, with 5% of the workforce saying they will support strike action. "However, we also know that much more than this is going into pay increases for HEI [higher education institution] staff: 3% incremental rises for many plus merit payments beyond this. "Our HEIs tell us that the vast majority of their staff understand the reality of the current environment and would not want to take action that could harm their institutions and their students." </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/69961000/jpg/_69961608_iphone624.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called on the help of metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container, which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <body>A Cambridgeshire head teacher wrote to parents about teaching their children to play conkers, after realising 95% of them did not know how. John Cattermole, from Littleport Primary, said he had to carry out a risk assessment and check the game was safe for nut allergy sufferers first. Conkers is not banned in schools, but some have chosen not to allow the game citing health and safety concerns. Mr Cattermole said parents were "very supportive" and the children loved it. He said he was inspired to introduce the game after seeing children looking at conkers on the ground, but not knowing what to do with them. "We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95% of them had never had a game of conkers in their life," he said. In the letter to parents, Mr Cattermole wrote: "We believe [conkers] is a fun, healthy game to play. It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play. "Mr Rivett and I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly today. "We have been in touch with the Anaphylaxis Association, as we have children at school with nut allergies. They have said there is no need to worry about conkers being on a school site." Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers. Mr Cattermole said the school had received "many, many supportive emails" after sending the letter and said not one of the 416 pupils' parents objected. "Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground - but really it's just fun," he said. </body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests. Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text. The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common. "These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight. "It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said. For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country. Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met. About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger. Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else. More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger. Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting. "I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight. Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else. "I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place." Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way." According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013. Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm. Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply. With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people. Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands. "What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said. Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content. Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school. But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons. "Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said. She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme. "It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added. </body>

      <title>Fear over part-time student numbers</title>
      <description>Rising fees and pressure on household spending are behind a 40% fall in part-time student numbers, say university leaders.</description>

      <body>A "perfect storm" of causes is leading to a rapid and worrying decline in part-time student numbers in England, university leaders have warned. The Universities UK study blames rising fees, pressure on household budgets and reduced support from employers. It examines why part-time students have fallen by 40% in two years, equivalent to a reduction of 105,000. There are concerns that such part-time courses are necessary to provide the skills needed by industry. Sir Eric Thomas, who headed the review, said "something is going wrong". There has been widespread recognition of the economic importance of part-time courses in allowing adults to improve their skills. Most of the 500,000 students taking part-time courses are adults, a majority are women and most will be studying a vocational or work-related course. But the numbers have been been tumbling for two years and the report says that next year's recruitment figures do not suggest that this downward trend will be reversed. Professor Thomas, who is vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: "The reality is that the UK needs more graduates and relies heavily on part-time higher education to meet these fast-changing skills needs in a fast-changing world. "We ignore part-time study's transformative power for individuals and society at our peril. "In England in particular, numbers are declining and do not look like rallying." The report says that the sharp decline in numbers reflects a combination of factors. It calls for part-time courses to be seen as an integral part of higher education and "not as an add-on". "There needs to be an urgent push at all levels - national, regional and local - to help potential students and employers understand the value of and opportunities for part-time higher education," says the report. Rachel Wenstone, National Union of Students vice president, said there needed to be more thought about how part-time degree courses were compatible with people's lives. "This obvious decline cannot be swept under the carpet any longer - there needs to be a collective response from all levels to the challenges that these groups of students are facing," she said. The Confederation of British Industry's chief policy director, Katja Hall, said: "It's shocking that the number of part-time undergraduate students has plummeted over the last two years. "For our economy to stay competitive we'll need more people with higher levels of skills, so it's more important than ever that working people have the opportunity to re-train and up-skill." Alex Bols, executive director of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities, said: "A decline in part-time study could hamper the UK's attempts to extend its skills base and economic growth." </body>

      <title>Gove urged to monitor free schools</title>
      <description>The education secretary is urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove has been urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt wrote to Mr Gove saying he was concerned problems at Al-Madinah School revealed a "systemic complacency". The government said it was looking into the school before issues became public. A junior education minister warned the Derby free school it had 17 issues to address including poor standards. Free schools are state-funded schools set up by faith groups, parents, teachers and other individuals and groups. They are directly accountable to the Education Secretary as they are not within the local authority sphere of influence. Al-Madinah School was closed for seven days earlier this month after a single day of inspections by Ofsted which found incomplete records of child protection checks for staff. And concerns were raised about female teachers at the school being told to wear the hijab even if they were not Muslim. In his letter to the education secretary, Mr Hunt said: "In the coming days, we expect Ofsted to publish the inspection report on one of your flagship free schools, the Al-Madinah Free School in Derby. "You will be very aware of the high level of public interest and concern generated by the recent temporary closure of the school and the imminent findings of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. "As I am sure you will agree, there should be no excuse for underperformance in any school. But it is especially troubling that 400 pupils should be deprived of a week of schooling because a publicly funded free school failed in its duty to meet basic child safety requirements." He added: "Moreover, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for schools has recently acknowledged that the Al-Madinah Free School is 'delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education', and I am extremely concerned that this situation could be indicative of a systemic complacency on standards." Mr Hunt went on to ask whether Mr Gove was satisfied with current arrangements for spotting underperformance in free schools. He also asked the education secretary to explain how parents would be provided with a "firm guarantee that their children's education and safety is not being put at risk due to the inadequate oversight of your free school programme". The letter also highlighted claims there were warnings from Ofsted regarding potential issues with welfare, health and safety of pupils at the Derby school before it opened in September 2012. Mr Gove was asked to explain what steps were taken to ensure that these "warnings were heeded" and that "all issues were resolved before the school opened". The Department for Education did not address many of these questions in its statement, but it did say: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Al-Madinah school was among the first free schools in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils. But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward. A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating. "While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur." The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. Ofsted is expected to publish its report on the school in the next week or so. </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families. Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing". The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life". The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture". The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards. Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read". "This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories. "Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability." The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents. It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions. "In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average. "The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries. "We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most." Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture. She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again. "There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available. "She will be paying for it until November 2022. "There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads. "The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either." Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier". But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families. The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child. The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that. The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights. "There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper. "Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived. "Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living." </body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest. Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists. The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early. It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages. The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six. They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain. To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life. Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict. This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests. It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest. Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study. He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age. "This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait." Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly. Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words. Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain. The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language. In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders. "This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study. "This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism." Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions. "There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said. "Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function." The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK). </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24566926</url>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <title>Asia’s parents suffering 'education fever'</title>
      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson. Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life. The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either. "I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?' "If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on. "I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back." Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture. But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime". "I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said. "I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn." In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths. "People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free." After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust. "Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days. "The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out." Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices." He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point. He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path". Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s. Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching. "The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.' "Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work." Frank says things then went further downhill. "I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored." Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years". He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence. "People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there. "Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story. "If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education. "Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable." </body>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day? Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess? Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy? Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders. On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security. There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen. But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry. The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS. There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy. Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves. Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups. Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area. There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income. Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China. Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers. The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship". The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future. He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do." "There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says. He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics. In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff. "You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available." There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives. He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment. "This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home." The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning. "I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it." It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals. The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away. The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training. The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms. Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus. But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon? On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields. It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats. There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation. Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect". "I don't take too precious a view of that." But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich. When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players. Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change. "We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades. "There is something powerful in having great seats of learning." </body>
