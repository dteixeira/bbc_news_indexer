      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has waded into an escalating row about Facebook's decision to allow videos showing people being decapitated back on its pages. He tweeted that it was "irresponsible" of the social network to post such videos without warning. Facebook reversed a temporary ban on such videos, saying users should be free to watch and condemn such content. The move was also condemned by one of the website's advertisers. The row gained momentum when Mr Cameron tweeted: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Car-sharing firm Zipcar told the BBC it was disappointed that its adverts had appeared next to one of the videos. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. The BBC was alerted to the fact that such content was back online by a reader who said the firm was refusing to remove a page showing a clip of a masked man killing a woman, which is believed to have been filmed in Mexico. It was posted last week under the title, Challenge: Anybody can watch this video? The social network later confirmed it was allowing such material to be posted again. "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," said a spokeswoman. "However, since some people object to graphic video of this nature, we are working to give people additional control over the content they see. This may include warning them in advance that the image they are about to see contains graphic content." But the decision has been criticised by its own advisors and law enforcers. The chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, Stephen Balkam - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "surprised" and "unhappy" at the move and would be contacting the firm to make clear his concerns. After being contacted by a member of the local community, the South Australia Police (Sapol) force has also registered a complaint with Facebook about a video showing the decapitation of a woman. Facebook advised Sapol it would not be removing the video. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Facebook advised us that they had reviewed the video and found, 'It did not violate our community standard on graphic violence'. Our team then spoke with a representative of Facebook about the decision, but were advised that the video would remain in place as a platform for community debate. "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>

      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently announced Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Android and iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. Nokia added that the inclusion of four microphones in the higher-end 1520 should appeal to consumers interested in making recordings of school concerts and other events with multiple sources of sound. In addition, a new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. Nokia has suggested Microsoft would bring its Skydrive cloud storage service and ability to link up to Xbox games consoles to the handsets following the takeover. But one market watcher questioned their future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform and end Asha out sooner rather than later." </body>

      <title>Blackberry resumes BBM roll-out</title>
      <description>Blackberry announces it is resuming the roll-out of its BBM messaging app for Android and iPhone after September's botched launch.</description>

      <body>Blackberry has resumed a phased roll-out of its BBM messaging app for Android and Apple devices after September's botched launch. The free app is now available for download on Google Play, the App Store and selected Samsung App Stores. But users had to register an email address after downloading the app then wait in line until they were told they could begin using it, Blackberry said. Last month Blackberry had to delay the launch after the software was leaked. The company said that "in just seven hours [following the leak], about one million Android users were using the unreleased version of BBM for Android". This had caused unspecified "issues" for the launch, it said. About six million people had signed up for information abut BBM at BBM.com, the company said. "To help manage this unprecedented pent-up demand for BBM, we are implementing a simple line-up system to ensure a smooth roll-out," wrote company spokesman Andrew Bocking. Those who had already signed up for information about BBM were able to start using the app straight away, he said. Others would have to wait in line, but the company did not specify how long the wait might be. The botched launch was the latest in a run of bad news for the struggling Canadian firm, which is cutting 4,500 jobs, made a net loss of $965m (Â£600m) in the second quarter of 2013, and has agreed a $4.7bn sale to a consortium led by Fairfax Financial. Blackberry has failed to keep pace with Apple and devices running Google Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems. In September, it announced that it was exiting the consumer market to concentrate on providing services to business customers. But the Blackberry Messenger product - known as BBM - has proved very popular, particularly with younger users. The software offers an alternative to SMS messages - which cost money on some subscription plans - as well as other voice and screen-sharing capabilities. </body>

      <title>Cyber defence unit 'may use hackers'</title>
      <description>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, says the head of the new unit.</description>

      <body>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, the head of the new unit has said. Lt Col Michael White told BBC Newsnight he would "look at individuals in the round" when assessing applicants. Recruitment would be focused on "capability development" rather than "personality traits", he added. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit was announced by the government in September. Under the Â£500m initiative, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is set to recruit hundreds of reservists as computer experts to work alongside regular armed forces. The unit will defend national security by safeguarding computer networks and vital data, and it will also launch strikes in cyberspace if necessary. It is hoped the move will address the shortage of people with the technological skills and knowledge to protect corporations, the military, and government systems from cyber attacks. The MoD said the recruitment, which started in early October, would target regular personnel leaving the armed forces, current and former reservists with the required skills, and civilians with the appropriate technological knowledge. When asked by Newsnight whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking, Lt Col White said: "I think if they could get through the security process, then if they had that capability that we would like, then if the vetting authority was happy with that, why not? "We're looking at capability development, rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits." Defence Secretary Philip Hammond unveiled plans for the cyber defence unit last month. Mr Hammond also told Newsnight he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be employed. "Each individual case would be looked at on its merits," he said. "The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out." But one former hacker told Newsnight the government had already undermined its chances of attracting talented individuals. Mustafa al-Bassam, now a computer science student at King's College London, was the youngest hacker in the Lulzsec group - which recently targeted organisations such as the FBI in the US and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) in a 50-day hacking campaign. He told the BBC that revelations by former US contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of mass surveillance carried out by intelligence agencies - including the US' National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ - had dissuaded him from using his cyber skills to protect UK national security. "I can understand the need for a government to protect itself, but when you go ahead and stomp on everyone's civil liberties - as we've seen with all the mass surveillance stories that have been out over the past year - I think you can rest assured that you're going to repel talented people," he said. Dr David Day, a Sheffield Hallam University computer forensics expert who provided evidence for Mr Al-Bassam's conviction, told Newsnight it was a "terrible shame" someone convicted of malicious hacking would find it difficult to get a job in the industry. "If they have those abilities and those skills, then some of the best talent we can't use," he said. Cyber attacks and crime have become more common in recent years. In July, it emerged Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber espionage operations a month against government or industry networks, GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban told the BBC business secrets were being stolen on an "industrial scale". And in a written statement in December last year, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said 93% of large corporations and 76% of small businesses had reported a cyber breach in 2012.

      <title>Wikipedia in fake entries probe</title>
      <description>Editors of the English-language Wikipedia site express "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of paid-for entries.</description>

      <body>Wikipedia editors have expressed "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of user accounts set up to make paid-for entries. Paid-for advocacy and the adoption of fake "sockpuppet" identities for promotional purposes are against the free web encyclopaedia's policies. Sue Gardner, executive editor of the Wikimedia Foundation, said "as many as several hundred" accounts were suspect. Editors have blocked or banned more than 250 accounts, she added. "Our goal is to provide neutral, reliable information for our readers, and anything that threatens that is a serious problem," said Ms Gardner. "We are actively examining this situation and exploring our options." Wikipedia considers paid-for advocacy a "black hat" practice, she said, that "violates the core principles that have made Wikipedia so valuable for so many people." The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organisation that operates Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia. According to investigations by the service's editors, most of the disputed entries appear to originate from a US company called Wiki-PR, which claims to "build, manage, and translate Wikipedia pages for over 12,000 people and companies." The editors say promotional entries - which were posted by an account called "Morning227" as well as by others - have been commissioned by Silicon Valley dot-coms, small financial institutions, authors, medical doctors, a musician and an oil company, amongst others. Citations are taken from a number of blog-like websites that accept "citizen journalist" material, including CrunchBase, DigitalJournal.com and Technorati.com. Entries "often have a promotional tone and always contain material that is either neutral or that is flattering of their subjects, never material that is critical or negative," Wikipedia said. However, Wiki-PR disputed the idea it had broken Wikipedia's rules by promoting or advertising its clients' agendas, saying it merely wanted to ensure they were "presented accurately" on the site. "The PR in Wiki-PR is a misnomer - we're a research and writing firm," Jordan French, the firm's chief executive, told the BBC. "We research the subject and write in an accurate and properly referenced way about it, filling a hole at Wikipedia for many subjects - concepts, companies, people, even astronomy - in which other editors lack an interest. "We're part of the fabric of Wikipedia - an integral part - and useful where volunteers don't want to or cannot put in the time to understand a subject, find sources, code, upload, and professionally monitor a page.

      <title>Obama addresses healthcare glitches</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (Â£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 glitch hits RT owners</title>
      <description>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets.</description>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become unusable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <body>A browser-based re-creation of the popular Super Mario Brothers console game has fallen foul of Nintendo's copyright lawyers, The Washington Post has reported. College student Josh Goldberg created the Full Screen Mario site in HTML 5 so people could play the game in a web browser rather than on a games console. But Nintendo has asked him to remove the content saying it infringes its "intellectual property rights". The game is still operational. Mr Goldberg, who admitted he did not get permission from Nintendo to re-create the game, said he began the project in October 2012 as a computer programming exercise. He "didn't care" about copyright issues because he "didn't think it would be a big project", he told the newspaper. But after little initial interest the game is now receiving 300,000 unique visitors a day, Mr Goldberg claims, after Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow blogged about it. Unfortunately for Mr Goldberg, the site's popularity also brought it to the attention of Nintendo's lawyers. "Nintendo's like Disney - it will not tolerate their characters being used on anything," said Keza MacDonald, UK games editor for IGN.com, the video game and entertainment site. "Earlier this year Nintendo stopped people posting footage of their games on YouTube, so this behaviour sounds entirely consistent." At the bottom of the site's home page the site declares: "Mario, Super Mario Brothers, and all associated games and media are property of Nintendo and/or Nintendo of America Inc., and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws."

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>French outrage over US spying claims</title>
      <description>France summons the US ambassador over claims in Le Monde newspaper that the US routinely spied on millions of phone calls in France.</description>

      <body>France's foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations the US National Security Agency spied on millions of phone calls in France. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he was "deeply shocked" by the claims made in the Le Monde newspaper. The data, based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, suggest the NSA monitored officials and businesses as well as terror suspects. The White House said "all nations" conducted spying operations. "As a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations," said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Le Monde says the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France in just 30 days between 10 December last year and 8 January 2013. The intercepts were apparently triggered by certain key words. The agency also apparently captured millions of text messages. It was unclear whether the content of the calls and messages was stored, or just the metadata - the details of who was speaking to whom. And the paper did not say whether the operation, codenamed US-985D, was still in progress. Prime Minister Ayrault said: "It's incredible that an allied country like the United States at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification, no justification on the basis of national defence." The US embassy in Paris said in a statement: "The ambassador [Charles Rivkin] expressed his appreciation of the importance of the exchange, and promised to convey the points made back to Washington." Mr Rivkin assured Alexandre Ziegler, chief-of-staff to Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, that "our ongoing bilateral consultations on allegations of information gathering by US government agencies would continue," the statement said. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says the outrage is largely for public consumption, because the French government has been accused of running its own snooping operation similar to the US. Le Monde reported in July that the French government was storing vast amounts of personal data of its citizens on a supercomputer at the headquarters of the DGSE intelligence service. Connections inside France and between France and other countries were all monitored, Le Monde reported. Emails, text messages, telephone and internet browsing records are stored for years, it said. The latest revelations follow claims in the German media that US agents hacked into the email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (Â£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (Â£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Ship trackers 'vulnerable to hacks'</title>
      <description>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacks and exploitation, security experts warn.</description>

      <body>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacking, security experts have warned. Weaknesses in outdated systems could allow attackers to make ships disappear from tracking systems - or even make it look like a large fleet was incoming. Researchers at Trend Micro said their findings showed the danger of using legacy systems designed when security was not an issue. But one vessel-tracking specialist said spoof attempts could be easily spotted. Lloyd's List Intelligence's Ian Trowbridge said that in addition to the vulnerable technology - known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) - other measures could be used to identify marine activity. "The spoofing would immediately be identified by [Lloyd's List Intelligence] as a warp vessel," he said, "providing unexplained position reports outside of the vessel's speed/distance capability and thus subject to further investigation and validation." The AIS system is used to track the whereabouts of ships travelling across the world's oceans. For ships over a certain size, having AIS fitted is mandatory under international maritime law. It is designed to transmit data about a ship's position, as well as other relevant information, so that movements can be seen by other boats as well as relevant authorities on shore. One other use is to alert nearby ships when a man or woman is overboard - an alert that can easily be spoofed, says Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson. "It boils down to the fact that the protocol was never designed with security in mind," he told the BBC. "There's no validity checking of what's being put up there." Using equipment bought for 700 euros (Â£600), the researchers were able to intercept signals and make vessels appear on the tracking system, even though they did not exist. In one example, the team was able to make it look as if a ship's route had spelled out the word "pwned" - hacker slang for "owned". The information broadcast by AIS is public - but when the system was first put in use, in the early 1990s, the technology required to receive the information was prohibitively expensive for those not directly involved in the industry. But now, a typical internet connection can be used to see the locations of boats, as well as an indicator of what type of cargo they may be carrying. There has been speculation that Somali pirates have been making use of the system. "It has long been thought that the pirates are basically using AIS as a shopping list," Mr Ferguson said, "seeing what's coming into local waters, and what cargo it may have." However, Lloyd's List Intelligence noted that captains are permitted to disable AIS if they feel their crew could be endangered by it. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>AT&amp;T agrees $4.85bn tower deal</title>
      <description>US telecom giant AT&amp;T has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International.</description>

      <body>US telecom giant ATandT has agreed to lease nearly 9,100 of its towers and sell another 600 to tower operator Crown Castle International. ATandT will receive nearly $4.85bn (Â£3bn) in cash upfront as part of the deal. The deal gives ATandT cash to fund a new share buyback announced earlier this year, as well as a multi-billion dollar plan to upgrade its wireless and high-speed internet networks. It has also hinted that it is looking at making acquisitions in Europe. "This deal will let us monetise our towers while giving us the ability to add capacity as we need it," Bill Hogg, a senior vice-president with ATandT said in a statement. "And we'll get additional financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders." The deal is the latest such move by a US telecom operator. Last year, T-Mobile USA agreed to sell the rights to operate 7,200 cellular towers to Crown Castle for $2.4bn. Mobile operators can free up cash and focus on more profitable areas of their business by leasing or selling their towers. Meanwhile, specialist operators tend to lease the capacity on the towers to multiple operators in an attempt to maximise their profits. According to the latest deal, ATandT will sublease capacity on the towers from Crown Castle for a minimum of 10 years for $1,900 per month per site, with annual rent increases of 2%. Crown Castle said in a statement that it "will have the right to sublease other available capacity on the towers to additional tenants and believes the ATandT towers have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one additional tenant per tower". It added that nearly half of the towers were "located in the top 50 markets, where we expect the majority of network densification and upgrade activity to occur". Under the terms of the deal, Crown Castle will have exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 9,100 ATandT towers. The average term of the lease rights is about 28 years and Crown Castle will have the option to purchase the leased towers for about $4.2bn as the leases expire. </body>

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24579776</url>

      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (Â£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>Technology is giving a new twist to traditional art. Artists Rob and Nick Carter have created a digital painting based on the 1630 oil on copper painting, Dead Frog with Flies by Dutch artist Ambrosius Bosschaert the Younger. Digital technology allows the picture to gradually change over a three hour period showing from the frog's last breath to when it becomes just a skeleton having been eaten away by maggots. Kate Bryan at the Fine Art Society Contemporary explains the appeal of digital art.

      <body>Britain's changing weather patterns have resulted in an increase in the number of landslides in recent years as the result of heavy summer and winter rainfall. Geologists from the British Geological Survey have been measuring landslides across the UK for almost 30 years and have created a database of every landslide reported. Inside Out's Marie Ashby meets the team based in Nottinghamshire which is using technology to predict future landslides to help reduce the risk of disasters. Recent events including a road slippage in Rothbury, Northumberland and a railway landslip at Stainforth, South Yorkshire illustrate the impact of landslips on communities. The collapse of a section of cliffs in Dorset also claimed the life of Charlotte Blackman from Derbyshire when she was on holiday a year ago. It is hoped new technology will allow the British Geological Survey team to link geology and weather to produce a daily landslide forecast and prevent similar accidents. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One East Midlands on Monday, 21 October at 19:30 GMT and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter.

      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes. "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collectorâ¦ there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; Â£945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet accessâ¦ so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (Â£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eatingâ¦. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (Â£6bn to Â£31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europeâs supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Consumer body to study universities</title>
      <description>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition.</description>

      <body>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition. The move follows concerns of inadequate regulation and variable teaching quality at institutions in England. The OFT has called for information from students, universities, regulators, government bodies and employers. It said choice between universities should "play a positive role in underpinning their success in future". OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell acknowledged that universities in England "enjoy an enviable reputation across the world". The review will focus on undergraduate higher education, particularly on whether recent changes aimed at giving students in England more choice and driving competition, have been effective. It defines university as including any provider of higher education courses. The review will look at whether the regulatory system is contributing to effective competition or undermining it. Earlier this month, a report criticised university regulation in England as inadequate in an era of higher student fees. The Higher Education Commission said that before higher fees were introduced last year, universities depended on teaching grants which came with regulatory conditions attached - but as the value of teaching grants falls and student fees rise, the ability to regulate universities through funding is also reduced. The OFT says it is particularly interested to hear how universities compete for students, how they deliver value for money and how they decide which courses to offer and how to deliver them. It will ask whether information from universities is adequate to help prospective students decide where and what to study, whether universities meet students' expectations and what they can do if they need to complain. In May, a report by the consumer group Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) revealed big variations in teaching time, with students at some universities getting twice as much teaching as others doing the same subject elsewhere. It included a poll that found that almost one in three first-year students at UK universities felt their courses were not good value for money. Sonia Sodha, head of public services at Which?, said she hoped the OFT review would lead to an improvement in the quality of university courses. "Our comparisons with previous decades show that today's students are working for fewer hours, are set less work and are receiving less detailed feedback. "With increased tuition fees and a greater choice of universities and courses than ever before, it's essential that students can access better information about the academic experience on offer so they can see whether they are getting value for money." Toni Pearce, president of the National Union of Students, said: "It would be useful to have an external view of what is working well, and in the best interests of students, and what may need some reform. "We would be particularly interested to hear what the OFT finds on issues NUS has campaigned on over many years, such as student access to information, including full transparency on teaching arrangements, complaints procedures, and means of redress if and when things go wrong." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the review in the light of major changes to the sector. "It is still early days in terms of assessing how the changes are working, but universities have done a great deal already to increase the amount of available information on courses and to respond to feedback from students." </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <body>A school is likely to remain closed for the rest of the week after ceiling damage, probably caused by heavy rain. The Grade II-listed Albert Road Primary in Penarth closed after loose plaster was found on two ceilings. Vale of Glamorgan council said the damage, thought to be the result of a water leak, was spotted on Monday. About 385 children attend the school, with another 72 in the nursery. The council said the ceilings would have to be made safe before re-opening. Councillor Chris Elmore, cabinet member for children's services, said: "Our officers think the damage has been the result of a water leak, probably caused by the extremely heavy rain we had over the weekend. "The damaged ceilings are over two halls, which lead to the classrooms. "My priority is the safety of the children and staff, so unfortunately we have to close the school while we make the ceilings safe. "We apologise to parents for the inconvenience and I will make sure our officers do everything they can to have the school open again as soon as possible." Parents have been told the school will probably remain closed this week, while next week is the half-term holiday. It said there is "no issue" with asbestos in the ceilings. The Victorian-era building closed temporarily for repairs last year. In December 2012, the school was closed down for emergency repairs to pipe work which required the floors being lifted up. </body>

      <title>University demand 'to rise by 26%'</title>
      <description>Universities minister says demand for undergraduate places will grow by a quarter in two decades.</description>

      <body>The number of places at UK universities will have to grow by at least a quarter over the next 20 years, the universities minister has warned. David Willetts says in a paper for the Social Market Foundation that the number of places needs to grow from 368,000 to 460,000 to meet demand. Universities have seen a squeeze on places in recent years, with thousands of students failing to get on courses. The primary school place shortage could go on to hit undergraduates, he says. The paper from the universities minister is billed as his projection of the future of higher education in the UK. It seeks to update a report written 50 years ago when just 5% of young people went to university. The Robbins report called for and led to a bold expansion in university places. It rested on the guiding principle that higher education should be open to all able and qualified enough to go. Robbins considered what the demand was likely to be over the next 20 years - based on the number of suitably qualified young people, not economic forecasts of future jobs. The projections in Mr Willetts's pamphlet follow this model and suggests there will be a need for 92,000 more places for England-based students in UK universities in the next 20 years. He says the current demographic backdrop is very different to the 1960s, when the country was in the grip of a baby boom, because of the fall in the number of babies born in the 1990s. But he adds: "However, looking ahead to the 2020s, we can see the increase in the number of births since the turn of the century feeding through into more young people. Those pressures have already been felt in our nurseries and primary schools." He also argues that as educational standards in England improve over the coming years, there will be a greater supply of young people with the potential to go to university, thus increasing demand still further. And he goes on to highlight differences between the English higher education system and European ones, hinting at a more liberal approach. He also says: "The English system is quite unusual amongst advanced countries for having such selective systems of entry to university... Other countries allow virtually automatic progression to your local university if you have the requisite qualifications." Although the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has introduced more flexibility in the system, with universities being allowed to recruit unlimited numbers of brighter students (those gaining certain high grades), overall the numbers have remained fairly static since 2010. But it is expected numbers will begin to recover again this coming year when admissions quotas for individual universities are being relaxed. When the Robbins report was published in 1963 there were nearly 216,000 full-time students in higher education. Robbins projected this number would grow to 558,000 by 1980-81. Director of the Social Market Foundation Emran Mian said: "David Willetts provides a compelling case for expanding higher education. This is our best bet for equipping the UK economy with the skills it needs and improving social mobility." The report stops short of saying how such demand will be met. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the pamphlet was Mr Willetts's personal view but would not comment further. </body>

      <title>School gates smokers abuse principal</title>
      <description>A head teacher in south London is targeted for abuse after asking parents to stop smoking outside the school gates.</description>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <title>Union rejects teaching changes</title>
      <description>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions</description>

      <body>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions. EIS members voted against the changes by 59% to 41% in a consultative ballot. The proposals included greater flexibility over working, and changes to the things teachers should and should not be responsible for. There were also some changes to the list of agreed duties of things which should or should not be done by teachers. The EIS expects the current pay offer for teachers to now be withdrawn. The proposed changes were negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) following the publication of the McCormac Report on teacher employment. Among the proposals were greater flexibility over working time. For example a teacher might spend two hours more with students one week but have two hours less the next to balance this out. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has been consistent in stating that any proposals arising from discussion of the McCormac report would be subject to a ballot of our members. "We have now completed that process and the result is a clear rejection by Scotland's teachers of the suggested changes to working conditions. "As always, the EIS is listening to its members and will make teachers' views known to the management side at the forthcoming meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers". The union said the rejection of the proposed changes to working conditions is also likely to have an impact on the agreed 1% pay offer for teachers in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Local government body Cosla had indicated that the 1% pay offer could be withdrawn if teachers rejected the changes to working conditions. The current pay offer also included improvements to the payment for short term supply teachers, a move being funded by the Scottish government. Mr Flanagan added: "We will be seeking constructive dialogue with both Cosla and Scottish government on what happens next. "No one wishes to see disruption in our schools, particularly at such a crucial phase in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, so we will await discussion of the issues at the SNCT before deciding how to proceed. "The ballot result, however, is indicative of the mood of teachers who after a two year pay freeze, increased pension contributions and in the face of excessive workload have simply said, 'Enough is enough.'" Councillor Billy Hendry, Cosla's human resources spokesman, said: "Firstly I am disappointed with the outcome of the EIS ballot. Secondly I am very disappointed that our teaching workforce will now not have their back dated pay in their pay packets before Christmas. "The simple fact is that as employers we have put together the very best components of an offer in agreement with the unions and the Scottish government. "The offer is a package and is not open to any one of the three parties to cherry pick the bits that they like best and reject the rest. "This offer remains on the table and will do so during our meeting with the EIS tomorrow." Education Secretary Michael Russell said: "I am disappointed that EIS members have voted to reject the proposals. "Obviously the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) will have to look at this matter as a matter of urgency when they meet tomorrow." </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <title>Child psychologist provision warning</title>
      <description>A national steering group warns that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low.</description>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

      <title>Tories reject Clegg free school plan</title>
      <description>Tory education minister Elizabeth Truss rejects calls by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for tighter controls on free schools in England.</description>

      <body>Conservative education minister Elizabeth Truss has rejected Liberal Democrat calls for tighter controls on free schools in England. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the schools should employ only qualified teachers and adhere to the national curriculum. He said this was so parents could be sure their children were receiving a high standard of education. Mrs Truss said it was a "shame" some Lib Dems did not back free schools. She said the "whole point" of the schools "is they have these freedoms... that's what's helping them outperform maintained schools". "You shouldn't kill off the goose that's laid the golden egg," she said. Mrs Truss noted that independent schools "operate well" without being made to hire qualified teachers and have done so "for hundreds of years". Mr Clegg has denied his comments represented a "great coalition crisis" ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister told Sky News they were part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" Last week, the head teacher of a free primary school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the al-Madinah free school in Derby was judged by the education watchdog Ofsted to be "inadequate". In his speech, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." The deputy prime minister told Sky News he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local council control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. On Sunday, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Michael Gove and David Cameron's divisive Free Schools programme is unravelling for all to see. "But Nick Clegg is locked-in to this failure too. It is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the al-Madinah Free School earlier, the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141% rise in unqualified teachers since 2010." A Department for Education spokesman argued that free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He said the government was not going to take away the freedom free schools have for teachers to "set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job". </body>

      <title>Teacher jobs scheme 'going well'</title>
      <description>Organisers of a scheme to give short-term employment to hundreds of newly-qualified teachers say they are pleased at the number who have been appointed.</description>

      <body>Organisers of a scheme to give short-term employment to hundreds of newly-qualified teachers in Northern Ireland have said they are pleased at the number who have been appointed. Almost 270 two-year posts have been created to help improve literacy and numeracy standards in deprived areas. While almost 200 posts have been allocated, about 70 remain unfilled. The scheme is open to young teachers who graduated within the last three years but do not have permanent jobs. In May, the Western Education and Library Board was given the task of matching schools with the graduates. Alison Smyth of the Western Board said they hoped to advertise again and appoint more teachers after the Halloween mid-term break. "We have been interviewing the young teachers, and it's great that we're in the position now to have so many of them employed," she said. Some head teachers have expressed concern that the graduate teachers are not all yet in place. Stephen McConkey of Hollybank Primary School in Monkstown said: "I appreciate it's a difficult and time-consuming exercise. However, any school would have liked to see these teachers on-site by the end of August or start of September." All post-primary, non-selective schools have been allocated at least one new teacher, and selected primary schools were targeted to give children extra help with reading, writing and mathematics. However, the two-year period paid for by the Department of Education will end in August 2015, even if the graduate teachers do not start work until weeks or months into the school year. One graduate who has been employed as part of the scheme said it would boost his chances of getting a permanent job. David Kearney, who was recruited by Hollybank Primary School, said: "Unfortunately the nature of supply work is that it's not guaranteed, and there were times you were waiting for a phone call. "This is not a long-term fix but it's great to give young teachers a chance to develop their skills. "It puts us in a better position to apply for permanent jobs in the future." </body>

      <body>A teacher who has brought Japanese to the West Country is one of the winners of this year's teachers' awards. The so-called "teachers' Oscar" for secondary teacher of the year has been won by Crispin Chambers of Tavistock College, a comprehensive in Devon. The languages teacher was praised for his inspirational lessons, high results and for building links with Japan. His local mayor says the town should erect a statue to him in recognition of his achievements as a teacher. There are 1,200 pupils studying Japanese at the secondary school, from Year 7 to A-level, which makes it one of the biggest Japanese departments in the country. The school has an annual exchange visit to Tokyo and the Japanese embassy has described Mr Chambers as a "trailblazer" for promoting the language. Mr Chambers says that when the idea of teaching Japanese was launched in the 1990s, no-one expected it to work. Languages such as Japanese and Chinese were seen as something more likely to be taught to the most able pupils in independent schools. He says that the challenge has been to make it accessible to all ability groups - and now there are about 50 to 60 people taking the subject at GCSE each year, with outstanding grades. As well sending students to study Japanese at university, Mr Chambers says that speaking Japanese is a huge advantage in the jobs market, in areas such as banking, medicine or law. There have been many warnings about the UK's poor level of language skills, but Mr Chambers says that it is possible to "capture the imagination" with languages and to show students there is a real value to learning a language. Mr Chambers's first experience of teaching was in Japan and he says he was captivated by the respect shown to teachers and that it was seen as a "pleasure to study". "Parents would thank you in the street for teaching their children," he says. The role of teaching in the UK also needs to be recognised for its importance, he says. "One teacher can be the dominant feature in someone's life," he says. There were 24,000 nominations for this year's Pearson Teaching Awards, which were launched in 1998 to celebrate the achievements of the teaching profession. This year's ceremony at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London saw 10 prizes being awarded. Among the famous names handing over prizes was Mo Farah, who has acknowledged the important role PE teacher Alan Watkinson played in developing his athletics career. The winners of the 2013 Pearson Teaching Awards are: The awards ceremony will be shown on BBC Two on Sunday, 27 October at 17:30 in Britain's Classroom Heroes </body>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Protesters disrupt French schools</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in Paris and other French cities are again disrupted by pupils protesting at the removal of two foreign students from France.</description>

      <body>Schools in Paris and other French cities are being disrupted again by pupil protests over the removal of two foreign students from France. Protesters gathered on the French capital's Bastille square, traditional meeting-place of the left, as some demonstrators clashed with riot police. Divisions have appeared among the ruling Socialists over the affair. It has emerged that the father of a Roma schoolgirl at the centre of the row lied over his asylum claim. However, the anger in France has focused on the way Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was removed from a school bus to be expelled along with her family earlier this month. They had been living in the eastern region of Doubs for several years. While President Francois Hollande has remained silent, his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, spoke out on Friday to question the girl's treatment. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Interior Minister Manuel Valls, who has defended the authorities' tough line and takes a tough policy towards Roma immigrants in general. The minister has cut short an official visit to the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to return to Paris, where findings of an inquiry into the handling of the affair are expected to be ready shortly. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said the family will be allowed to return if "any fault is found" with the expulsion order. There is also anger over the removal of Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia after being arrested for shoplifting, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally. Police fired tear gas at some protesters in Paris but the demonstration in the Nation-Bastille area appeared to be passing off peacefully in the main. Pupils partially blocked entry to as many as 20 secondary schools in Paris while allowing other pupils to enter to attend classes, the pupils' union Fidl said. Outside one school in central Paris, the Lycee Charlemagne, wheelie bins were used to block the entrance. A banner read "Jotters not [ID] papers". One protester at the school, named as David, told Reuters: "We're a bit lost, we say our country is the country of human rights, a country which welcomes people and we still deport a 15-year-old girl and a 19-year-old student to a country... that they don't know and where they have no future." There appeared to be less protest activity in other French cities but some schools were affected in Marseille, Lyon and Rouen. Speaking on a visit to Angers, Ms Trierweiler said "certain boundaries cannot be crossed" and "the school gate is one of them". Education Minister Vincent Peillon told French radio that it was wrong for the authorities to have detained the girl while she was on a trip. "What is certain is that when one is in the setting of a class outing, and that was the case, you are part of school life... and you can't intervene during that time," he said. "That means schools are kind of a sanctuary." Opinion polls suggest Mr Valls is the most popular member of President Hollande's government with the wider public. His critics point to the fact that he himself was born in Spain. However, he was naturalised in France more than 20 years ago. Leonarda Dibrani and her family have been given a flat and a small allowance in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, where they have been speaking to French journalists about the shock of being sent to a region where they are strangers, unable to speak Albanian. Resat Dibrani told media in Kosovo, where he and his family were expelled, that he had lied to the French authorities when he said his family was from the breakaway Serbian region. In fact, only he was born there while, according to him, his daughter Leonarda and other members of his family were born in Italy. "We lied to the authorities when we said we were from Kosovo," he told Reuters news agency. It emerged in France that the father was investigated by French authorities for allegedly beating his family. Khatchik Kachatryan spoke by phone from his home village in Armenia on Friday to say he had been forced on to a plane on Saturday after having his hands and feet bound and being gagged. The allegation could not be verified independently. He told French broadcaster BFMTV that he now faced having to do two years' military service in Armenia. This is the standard term for conscripts. </body>

      <body>More than 60 parents had asked Derby City Council about moving their children out of the Al-Madinah free school before a damning Ofsted report was released, the BBC has learned. The figures pre-date the report, which said the school was failing in all areas and was "dysfunctional". Enquiries were made by 67 parents, with 33 making formal applications to put their children elsewhere. The school said it accepted the findings and would use them to move on. On Thursday, Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were serious problems at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. The Ofsted report said teachers at Al-Madinah were inexperienced and had not been provided with proper training and that the school required special measures. Parent Razwana Bibiakbar said she would not be taking her child out of the school but added that it had let the pupils down. She said: "Something has to be done [like bringing] new leadership, new team, new staff - qualified - into Al-Madinah school to run it properly. "Why should I pull my daughter out of that school? Why can't they pull their socks up and fix everything?" The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby on Thursday that the Al-Madinah situation should not be used as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement. </body>

      <title>'Boost family learning in schools'</title>
      <description>Millions of children are being held back by their parents' poor educational attainment, suggests a report.</description>

      <body>Millions of children in England and Wales are held back by their parents' poor basic skills, suggests a report. Involving the whole family in learning can boost educational attainment across generations and should be integral to schools says the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Governments should give family learning more support, the report says. England is "a nation in crisis" as far as skills are concerned said inquiry chairwoman Baroness Howarth. "Adults whose parents have low levels of education are eight times more likely to have poor proficiency in literacy than adults whose parents had higher levels of education," writes Valerie Howarth in her foreword. "Surely it is a moral outrage that a nation such as ours should be in this position." The report draws on a recent OECD study which found that adults in England score among the lowest results in international literacy and numeracy tests when compared with the same age group in other industrialised countries. The OECD study, published earlier in October, found England was 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. The NIACE team also looked at research from national and local government, Ofsted and from educational, family and children's charities. They found "particularly compelling evidence that family language and maths programmes benefit children's skills as well as those of their parents and carers". They also found evidence of wider benefits from improving adults' confidence and self-esteem to reducing ill health, unemployment and re-offending. NIACE urges head teachers to fund family learning through the Pupil Premium which is paid to schools to support the attainment of pupils on free school meals or in care. It also calls for government departments to work together to support family learning and to ensure that there is enough funding to meet demand. David Hughes, chief executive of NIACE said: "Imagine growing up in a home where there are no books, no stories and where your parents don't have the confidence to help you with your homework. "Unfortunately that is a reality for too many children - but this situation can be overcome. "Across the country there are examples of family learning programmes which have transformed the prospects of adults and children. "But these programmes should not be the exception, they need to be the norm in every school and community." A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said the government already supported adults to improve English and maths skills, whether or not they were in work, fully funding GCSE and other qualifications. "We support a wide range of provision so that adults can participate in learning in the way that suits them, including community learning, traditional college courses and online learning." The government also supports family learning through the Â£210m community learning budget to fund a range of flexible courses, including English and maths tailored to individuals' needs and learning styles, said the spokeswoman. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College Leaders said he broadly welcomed the report. "Parents play a hugely important role in their children's success at school, and schools already do a great deal to engage parents and help them to support their children. "There are a lot of examples of good practice already in schools around the country to draw on. "It is a two-way street however, and while schools can offer opportunities parents have to be willing to engage in them. "Sadly some parents can't or won't support their children's learning and in those cases it is incredibly challenging for schools to create family learning links." </body>

      <title>More universities look beyond grades</title>
      <description>More UK universities are using extra and personal information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>More UK universities are using personal and extra information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests. Of the 67 institutions who replied to a survey, 37% said they used such "contextual data" - and most of the remaining ones planned to do so. UK universities are encouraged to use such data to recruit more students from poor homes. University leaders are calling for an informed public debate on the issue. In England, permission to charge tuition fees higher than Â£6,000 a year is on condition that universities work to attract and recruit more poorer students. Less formal arrangements, also encouraging this move towards "widening participation", are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research carried out by a publicly funded but independent body called Spa (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) looked at what kind of extra information universities were using when making offers to students or deciding whom to admit. It says a survey it carried out of UK universities in November last year found that 37% of those who responded (67 in total) used contextual data and 57% planned to do so. Extra information used (beyond grades and predicted grades) includes personal details put on an application, information about applicants' school or college, the kind of area they live in and whether they have taken part in activities designed to "raise aspirations". Such data is used mostly, Spa found, in considering whether to admit "borderline" pupils at the point when places are confirmed. After that, it is used in clearing - the process run in August to match students to places - to decide whom to offer places to, to interview and to admit. Finally, the researchers say such information is used to consider "whether or not to make a differential offer" - that is, when deciding to make someone an offer at lower grades than is usual because of the potential they show. Contextual data has been used for "many years", according to Spa, but is now "playing an increasing role in strengthening fair admissions and access at all stages of the admissions process". It says more research is needed - as well as more transparency from institutions about their admissions systems. The study says more universities are moving towards a centralised system for admissions, away from individual departments controlling this. Professor Janet Beer, chair of the Spa steering group and vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: "Spa's report brings together, for the first time, the evidence base for using contextualised admissions in the UK higher education sector. "It shows us that this information has an important role to play in ensuring fair access for applicants as well as helping to sustain academic excellence by admitting those who demonstrate the strongest potential to thrive in higher education." Professor Beer added that there was a "growing appetite" among universities for using contextual data, not least because of the more competitive market. Paul Clark, from Universities UK, which represents university leaders, said universities were "driven by the desire to maintain excellence by recruiting the best students for their courses and identifying candidates with the most potential to succeed". "This report shows that increasing numbers of universities are looking to use contextual data to do this," he said. "University can be a life-changing experience. Contextual data is one way of ensuring that anyone with the ability and desire to go to university has the opportunity to do so. "As the report concludes, it is also important that universities are open about their use of contextual data and information. There is a need to have an informed public debate about the merits of using this additional data in the university admissions process." There has been some criticism of the use of such data and accusations that this amounts to "social engineering". Private school heads say they support the "sensible and sensitive" use of such information - as long as it is used fairly. Chris Ramsey, from the HMC which represents leading independent schools and head master of the King's School in Chester, said contextual data was an important part of the admissions process - and his school used it too. "We are not opposed to its use - as long as it is personal to each student, sensitively and sensibly used, and as long as it is not simply blanket bias for or against certain student types - for example, bias for or against students who went to a particular type of school," he said. "Each student deserves to be treated as an individual, not as part of a politically-determined group. "A student who has been, for example, educated at a low-performing school for only part of his or her career, or who is state-educated but from a socially privileged background, should not be advantaged over one who has worked hard or been given a bursary at an independent school." </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (Â£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (Â£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (Â£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>School forgets time capsule location</title>
      <description>An Essex school is unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no one remembers where it is buried.</description>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called on the help of metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container, which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <body>A Cambridgeshire head teacher wrote to parents about teaching their children to play conkers, after realising 95% of them did not know how. John Cattermole, from Littleport Primary, said he had to carry out a risk assessment and check the game was safe for nut allergy sufferers first. Conkers is not banned in schools, but some have chosen not to allow the game citing health and safety concerns. Mr Cattermole said parents were "very supportive" and the children loved it. He said he was inspired to introduce the game after seeing children looking at conkers on the ground, but not knowing what to do with them. "We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95% of them had never had a game of conkers in their life," he said. In the letter to parents, Mr Cattermole wrote: "We believe [conkers] is a fun, healthy game to play. It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play. "Mr Rivett and I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly today. "We have been in touch with the Anaphylaxis Association, as we have children at school with nut allergies. They have said there is no need to worry about conkers being on a school site." Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers. Mr Cattermole said the school had received "many, many supportive emails" after sending the letter and said not one of the 416 pupils' parents objected. "Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground - but really it's just fun," he said. </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been described by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure". He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position". </body>

      <description>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales.</description>

      <body>Children as young as 10 have been taught about domestic violence in a pilot scheme which could now be rolled out across Wales. Two Carmarthenshire primary schools took part in the six week pilot aimed at recognising danger signs in relationships. Hafan Cymru's project had only been used in secondary schools before. The charity said it was so successful the aim was to use it right across Wales. In the pilot, six sessions for 10 and 11 year olds were delivered in the two participating schools and one for parents and training for staff. Gaynor Jones, schools resource officer for Hafan Cymru, said it was the first scheme in Wales they knew of that has been delivered to children across Years 5 and 6. "They've [the pupils] been absolutely brilliant, they've been really open, they've learnt a lot of new ideas," she added. "They've learnt a lot of new vocabulary and I think it's really important that we get that vocabulary out into the public domain. "We're hearing they're discussing it with parents at home as well and that's great, we want those messages to be carried home." Last year a third of Hafan Cymru's service users were aged 16-24, and the organisation feels that preventative work in schools is key to ending domestic abuse in communities. But Ms Jones admits funding is the issue that could prevent the scheme being rolled out wider. And she is hoping that the Welsh government's White Paper about ending violence against women becomes law and will be followed up with funding which is "absolutely vital". "We know that teenagers are getting into abusive relationships younger and younger now," Ms Jones added. "We're developing a peer education project with our service users in Hafan Cymru and one of those women we're working in entered her first abusive relationship when she was 13. "So by the time children are in secondary school, it's not too late. We can still save some hopefully. "But if we can get the message out younger, that's great." Catrin Nicholas, assistant head teacher at Ysgol Llech y Fedach in Tumble, said she had initial concerns about how such a difficult subject could be dealt with but she said the content had been aimed properly at young children. "Once the initial session was over I realised it was going to be all right because it focused on good relationships with others. "It focused on the positive points of that rather than anything too scary or too frightening for pupils who are so young," she said. </body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice. Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke. It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant. Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues. Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises. He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased. "The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said. "We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils." A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced. </body>

      <title>Bright poor 'held back for decades'</title>
      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24539514</url>
      <date>1381959147</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70517000/jpg/_70517718_sexting.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests. Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text. The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common. "These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight. "It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said. For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country. Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met. About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger. Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else. More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger. Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting. "I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight. Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else. "I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place." Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way." According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013. Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm. Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply. With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people. Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands. "What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said. Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content. Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school. But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons. "Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said. She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme. "It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added. </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was Â£427 a week - 60% of that figure was Â£256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about Â£7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (Â£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (Â£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson. Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life. The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either. "I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?' "If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on. "I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back." Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture. But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime". "I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said. "I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn." In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths. "People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free." After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust. "Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days. "The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out." Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices." He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point. He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path". Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s. Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching. "The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.' "Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work." Frank says things then went further downhill. "I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored." Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years". He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence. "People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there. "Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story. "If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education. "Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable." </body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>
      <date>1381370654</date>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day? Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess? Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy? Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders. On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security. There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen. But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry. The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS. There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated Â£1.78m every single day to the local economy. Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves. Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups. Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area. There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income. Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China. Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers. The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship". The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future. He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do." "There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says. He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics. In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff. "You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available." There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives. He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment. "This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home." The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning. "I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it." It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals. The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away. The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training. The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms. Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus. But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon? On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields. It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats. There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put Â£400m into new accommodation. Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect". "I don't take too precious a view of that." But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich. When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of Â£962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players. Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change. "We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades. "There is something powerful in having great seats of learning." </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of Â£100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." They beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>British forests under threat</title>
      <description>New global threats from pests and diseases could spell disaster for British forests, experts warn.</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>Nuclear power plant gets go-ahead</title>
      <description>The government has signed a deal for the construction of Hinkley Point C, the UK's first nuclear station in a generation.</description>

      <body>The government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in future. Critics warn guaranteeing the group a price for electricity at twice the current level will raise bills. "For the first time, a nuclear station in this country will not have been built with money from the British taxpayer," said Secretary of State for Energy Edward Davey. The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost Â£16bn to build. The two sides have now agreed the "strike price" of Â£92.50 for every megawatt hour of energy Hinkley C generates. This is almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to Â£89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. John Cridland, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, welcomed what he said was a "landmark deal". "It's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. The fact is whatever we do, energy prices are going to have to go up to replace ageing infrastructure and meet climate change targets - unless we build new nuclear as part of a diverse energy mix." However, Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be Â£800m to Â£1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Prime Minister David Cameron said that the new Hinkley Point plant was "an excellent deal for Britain and British consumers". "This underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business," he added. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the Prime Minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. The existing plant at Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. The plans will also require state aid clearance from the European Commission. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be Â£77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the agreement on Hinkley was "good news". "Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020," it said. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Uganda seizes massive ivory haul</title>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." Here Dr Jochen Smolka from the University of Lund in Sweden, describes the findings. </body>

      <title>Canine virus threatens Siberian tiger</title>
      <description>Canine distemper is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24535799</url>
      <date>1382399856</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70502000/jpg/_70502776_z9340701-siberian_tiger_panthera_tigris_altaica_-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than Â£55m. Now the government has spent a further Â£60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this Â£60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around Â£100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK Â£27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (Â£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yesâ¦" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoesâ¦" "The small of my back, it's going to hurtâ¦" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that timeâ¦[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1Â³ + 12Â³ = 9Â³ + 10Â³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5â¦ ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952Â³ + (-951)Â³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12Â³=1728, or 9Â³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. The chairman of the committee, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. </body>

      <title>Scottish Power to pay Â£8.5m penalty</title>
      <description>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling. Ofgem said customers were misled during sales approaches due to Scottish Power's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. Consumers on the "warm home discount" will receive about Â£50 each. Money will also go to those who were misled. The company has apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012. "Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations," said Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison. Scottish Power will pay Â£7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty. It estimates each will receive a payment of about Â£50. It has also set up a Â£1m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. "Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers," the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. "We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected," said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. "This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. "However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. "Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored." Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling. In April, Ofgem said that SSE was guilty of management failures that led to "prolonged and extensive" mis-selling through telephone, in-store and doorstep sales. The regulator handed down a record Â£10.5m fine. Two other investigations - into Npower and E.On, are ongoing. Energy companies no longer sell energy door-to-door, a change that has reduced the number of people switching suppliers in recent times, figures show. Also on Tuesday, new rules from Ofgem came into force preventing energy firms from increasing prices during fixed-term contracts. Firms are also banned from automatically rolling customers on to another fixed-term offer when their current one ends. Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. "Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. "Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them," added Mr Wright. The reform follows Ofgem's research showing that even on fixed-term deals, suppliers could still increase prices. </body>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An on-going dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". The owners of the Grangemouth complex are to meet later to decide on the plant's fate. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite union said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Senior figures at Ineos, which operates and owns most of the 2.6 sq-mile site, are to consider the workforce's response to the offer. In doing so, they will also look at the patterns of the result across the plant, and across its varied technical skills. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." The plan includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined contribution scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support the plan at this stage would receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <title>Contested PPI woes top one million</title>

      <body>More than a million complaints about payment protection insurance (PPI) have been made to the financial ombudsman, latest figures show. Cases end up with the ombudsman if there is no agreement between a bank and its customer. In the third quarter of the year, 81% of all complaints made to the ombudsman were about PPI. Banks said that complaint numbers were starting to fall and institutions were improving how these were handled. PPI policies are supposed to repay people's loans if their income drops because they fall ill or lose their jobs. Some people have benefited from the policies, but many were unaware they were even paying for it. Others did not need it or would have been unable to make a claim. Thousands of people have already been compensated after being mis-sold the policies, and now a huge industry has built up around sorting all the claims that can be made. Consumer groups regard PPI as the UK's biggest financial mis-selling scandal. The ombudsman has said that some customers were facing "unnecessary delays" in receiving compensation payouts. Since April, 247,399 complaints have been made to the ombudsman about PPI. Some 70% of PPI disputes dealt with by the ombudsman in the same time period have been resolved in favour of consumers. The latest figures show that more than a million complaints have now been made to the ombudsman. About two-thirds of these have come in the last 18 months. However, a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the High Street banks, said: "Figures published by the Financial Conduct Authority last week showed that customer complaints have fallen by 17% this year. "Banks are determined that there will be no repeat of any of the bad practices which caused mis-selling in the past and have overhauled incentive structures. Staff are now rewarded for high levels of customer service and not sales volumes. The industry continues to work with the FCA and the ombudsman to improve complaint handling for customers." </body>

      <description>Government borrowing fell in September, official figures show, helped by higher tax revenues.</description>

      <body>Government borrowing fell in September, official figures show, helped by higher tax revenues. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the cost of interventions such as bank bailouts, was Â£11.1bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The figure is lower than the Â£12.1bn recorded in September 2012. The UK's net public debt pile stands at Â£1.21 trillion, which is equivalent to 75.9% of GDP. The government is aiming for a deficit of no more than Â£120bn this year, excluding the effect of cash transfers from Royal Mail and the Bank of England. For the first half of the current tax year, the deficit on this measure totalled Â£56.7bn, down more than 9% compared with the same period a year previously. Efforts to reduce UK borrowing and cut the country's debts are central to the government's economic policies. Chancellor George Osborne said earlier this month that a re-elected Conservative government would aim to wipe out Britain's budget deficit altogether by 2020. Total cash receipts between April and September rose to Â£265.3bn, up from Â£237bn a year earlier. "Borrowing is down this month compared to last year and for the year-to-date. The economy is turning a corner, but there is a long way to go," said a Treasury spokesperson. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures put the government on track for the full year. "The hope is that the trend in the public finances will increasingly improve over the coming months as improved economic activity increasingly feeds through to boost tax revenues and help limit benefit payments," he added. However, Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government's deficit plan was "way off track". "Three years of flatlining growth and falling living standards mean George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by 2015. He's forecast to borrow over Â£200bn more than planned simply to pay for the costs of his economic failure." </body>

      <title>Ex-Co-op boss: Bank move 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>The former chief executive of the Co-op Group says the mutual firm's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank was "a tragedy".</description>

      <body>The former chief executive of the Co-op Group has said the mutual group's loss of overall control of the Co-op Bank is "a tragedy". However, Peter Marks, who left the group this year, said it could also be seen as a "good thing". "It will force the Co-op to focus on less businesses and not stretch its capital in the way that it has been," he added. Mr Marks was being questioned by the Treasury Committee of MPs. The hearing was over the purchase of 632 Lloyds bank branches, which Co-op Bank pulled out of in April. On Monday, the Co-op Group said a restructuring of its rescue deal for Co-op Bank, which will provide it with extra capital, meant it would end up holding just a 30% stake in the bank. Under its original plan it would have held a 70% stake. "How many businesses try to be major bank, major pharmacy, major food retailer, major funeral director?" asked Mr Marks. He said he had warned that the Co-op Group should focus on fewer businesses, but the group's structure meant that he did not have the power to change this during his six years at the helm. "Being a chief executive of a co-operative is very different to being a chief executive of a PLC. I don't believe I could have changed the governance structure," he said. However, Mr Marks said the plan to buy the bank branches from Lloyds had offered a "great opportunity". "The bank was sub-scale, it needed to build scale to compete and survive. Verde [the Lloyds branches] created a great opportunity to do that and bring in significant capital and a high quality chief executive," he said. The Co-op Bank's financial problems came to light after the bank pulled out of the deal to buy Lloyds' branches. In June, the Co-op announced it had reached an agreement with the bank regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to plug a Â£1.5bn capital hole in its balance sheet. This would have seen Co-op Group put in Â£1bn of capital itself, with Â£500m coming from bondholders and owners of preference shares. The bank would then have been floated, with Co-op Group holding a 70% share. However, the bank's creditors, led by US hedge funds, rejected the plan. </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>
      <date>1382428725</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently announced Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Android and iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. Nokia added that the inclusion of four microphones in the higher-end 1520 should appeal to consumers interested in making recordings of school concerts and other events with multiple sources of sound. In addition, a new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. Nokia has suggested Microsoft would bring its Skydrive cloud storage service and ability to link up to Xbox games consoles to the handsets following the takeover. But one market watcher questioned their future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform and end Asha out sooner rather than later." </body>

      <title>Muted start for bank switching plan</title>
      <description>The number of consumers changing current account provider has hardly changed pace during the first weeks of a new bank switching service.</description>

      <body>The number of consumers changing current account provider has hardly changed pace during the first weeks of a new bank switching service. Some 89,000 people switched in the first four weeks of operation of the multi-million pound service. Although this was up 11% on the same period last year, the figure is little different from the four-week average seen over the previous 12 months. It is argued that banks have done more to try to keep current customers. Under the new Switch Guarantee, Britain's 46 million current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. After a customer has switched their account, a new redirection service automatically transfers any payments accidentally made to a customer's old account to their new account for 13 months. "We never expected that every customer who is tempted to switch would rush out to do so at launch, but this is an encouraging start," said Adrian Kamellard, chief executive of the Payments Council, which is overseeing the new service. "This service is all about customers and the focus continues to be on them. Across the entire industry huge amounts of work continues to be put in to ensure that customers get the commitments made in the guarantee. "It is by getting this right that we can deliver on the objectives of increasing competition and providing greater choice for customers." Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: "These early figures are a positive sign that more consumers might be voting with their feet when they are dissatisfied with their bank, but suggest that the new process alone will fail to transform switching rates and significantly increase competition in banking. "Banks must make it simple for people to compare the cost of running a current account so they can be confident in their choices and give customers a reason to switch by offering better products and customer service." </body>

      <body>French utility firm GDF Suez has signed a deal with UK-based Dart Energy to explore Cheshire and the East Midlands for shale gas. GDF Suez will buy a 25% share in Dart's 13 onshore licences for Â£7.4m ($12m), followed by Â£16.7m for ongoing costs. The licences overlay the Bowland Shale area, estimated to contain 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas. The company said several wells will be drilled in the 1,378 sq km (532 sq miles) area, if the government allows. The French group said that, alongside Dart Energy, it planned to drill "a number of exploration wells" initially. Jean-Marie Dauger, chief executive of GDF Suez, said: "We are very confident about the potential of shale gas in the UK, and its anticipated contributions to UK energy security." He said the deal marked the company's first investment in UK shale gas. Mr Dauger added: "We look forward to working with our partner, Dart Energy, to unlock the potential of these licences." The deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <body>The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, has come under fire in China for reportedly charging locals higher prices than in other major markets. The official China Central Television (CCTV) claimed Starbucks earns higher margins in China due to its pricing. Starbucks is the latest foreign company to come under scrutiny from Chinese media over its pricing practices. Earlier this year, Apple and Nestle were also put under pressure to review their prices or customer service. Starbucks is rapidly expanding in China, which is set to overtake Canada as its second-biggest market next year. In the CCTV report that aired on Sunday, it said a medium-size latte in Beijing costs 27 yuan (Â£2.70;$4.43), or about one-third more than at a Starbucks in Chicago. "Starbucks has been able to enjoy high prices in China, mainly because of the blind faith of local consumers in Starbucks and other Western brands," Wang Zhendong, director of the Coffee Association of Shanghai, told CCTV. Starbucks said its prices reflect higher food and logistical costs in China. The issue became one of the most popular talking points on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, where many users seemed to rally to Starbucks' side. "Those who are saying Starbucks is expensive are probably those who don't drink much coffee," one user said. "The prices are competitive and the quality makes people feel safe." </body>

      <body>The owner of Costa Coffee reported a 12.6% rise in first-half profit after opening several new outlets of the High Street coffee chain. Whitbread, the UK's largest hotel and coffee shop operator, reported a pre-tax profit of Â£216.1m ($349m) in the six months up to 29 August. The profit beat analysts' expectations of Â£213m, and its Â£191.1m figure for the same six-month period last year. Whitbread's growth was also helped by new branches of its Premier Inn hotels. Total sales at Costa Coffee were up by 20.9%, and were 12.2% higher at Premier Inn. Commenting on the results, chief executive Andy Harrison said: "Our combination of strong organic growth, good returns on capital and strong cash flow should continue to create substantial shareholder value." Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the figures showed a "firm statement of intent in [Whitbread] achieving its strategic goals", alongside Whitbread's confirmation it will not give up Costa, the "jewel in its crown". "The Whitbread growth story continues to drive on," Mr Hunter added. </body>

      <body>Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation have agreed to launch a $24m (Â£15m) initiative to improve the conditions of garment workers. The move comes almost six months after a fire at a factory complex near Dhaka killed more than 1,100 people. That disaster prompted a range of initiatives to make textile factories safer and to protect workers' rights. But a textile plant fire earlier this month again highlighted dangerous conditions faced by employees. At least nine people were killed in the fire at the plant near the capital Dhaka. Safety standards in Bangladesh's garment factories are notoriously poor and fires are commonplace. The three-year plan announced on Tuesday is being funded by the British and Dutch governments. It will consolidate earlier factory safety measures, including an accord signed by major European retailers in May. Experts will conduct safety inspections at more than 1,000 factories as part of the initiative, which will target factories that operate as sub-contractors or produce garments for lesser-known Western retailers that have not signed up to safety accords established since the April disaster. A factory fire killed more than 100 workers in November. "We want to bring the number of industrial accidents to a tolerable limit," Labour and Employment Secretary Mikail Shipar told the AFP news agency. "There will be zero tolerance to poor working conditions in our factories." Sixty percent of Bangladesh's garment exports go to European retailers. Some estimates suggest that exporting ready-made garments to international clothing retailers is a $22bn (Â£13.5bn) industry in Bangladesh, accounting for four-fifths of the country's exports. Clothing makes up around three-quarters of Bangladesh's total exports. Dozens of international retailers agreed a plan last July to conduct inspections at factories from which their goods were sourced. </body>

      <body>TV and film streaming service Netflix has seen global subscriber numbers surge past 40 million and profits jump, thanks in part to its popular original programmes. The firm behind prison drama Orange is the New Black said its net profit rose to $32m (Â£19.8m) in the three months to the end of September. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of Â£7m. Shares in the firm rose 10% in after-hours trading on Monday. Netflix executives said its investment in original programmes had helped to drive profit. Its other self-produced shows included political drama House Of Cards. It now plans to double its investment in original content, but said it would still account for less than 10% of the overall output it offers. "Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable content ever produced," Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings and chief financial officer David Wells said in a letter to investors. The California-based company is considering further television shows, as well as starting to make its own movies. "We are actively looking right now at a few documentary projects. We'd like to do more of that in the movie space," said chief content officer Ted Sarandos. Netflix subscribers watched a total of about five billion hours of films and television shows in the last quarter, according to Mr Hastings. Netflix's shares rose to $388.50 in after-hours trading on Monday, compared with their close of $354.99 on the Nasdaq index. Standard and Poor's equity analyst Tuna Amobi said Netflix had "turned an important corner for potentially sustained subscriber growth". He added: "There is not a whole lot not to like. There is a whole lot of momentum behind the story." " </body>

      <title>British Gas Twitter move draws ire</title>
      <description>An attempt by British Gas to engage its customers in a question and answer session on Twitter ended up attracting a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage.</description>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by Â£123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as Â£10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra Â£137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to Â£1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <body>The UK's tax authority is stepping up its scrutiny of pension funds amid concerns over people being enticed into cashing in their pension early. Pension liberation schemes encourage people to access their pension savings before the age of 55. These schemes will no longer be automatically registered to receive funds when an online form is received by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Now the details will be scrutinised before they can operate. "The changes to our process are part of a government-wide initiative involving HMRC and other agencies aiming to detect, disrupt and deter promoters of pension liberation schemes and to ensure that individuals are aware of the true tax position," a spokesman for the tax authority said. "The vast majority of pension funds abide by their legal obligations but we won't hesitate to de-register a pension scheme where rules are not adhered to." Up to 70% of any funds released from a pension early can go to the tax authority. This is because pension saving is tax privileged, under the proviso that the funds are not touched until the saver reaches the age of 55 at least. These liberation scheme operators can also charge high fees, often between 10% and 20% of the amount "released". The operators of pension liberation schemes tend to work in the grey areas of the law, according to the regulator. Introducers to the schemes, or advisers, use text messages, cold calls, or website promotions to encourage people to access their "frozen" pension. They might suggest that people take a loan from the scheme provider, secured on their pension funds. Alternatively, the money might be transferred from the pension scheme into risky, unregulated investments often based overseas, the Pensions Regulator said. </body>

      <title>Credit union offering 'payday loans'</title>
      <description>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans.</description>

      <body>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans. London Mutual offers people the chance to borrow between Â£100 and Â£1,000 at an interest rate of 2% per month. Borrowers do not have to save with the credit union to apply but they must live or work within one of four inner-London boroughs. Other UK credit unions are expected to adopt a similar model next year. The loans are available on the London Mutual Credit Union's CUOK website. Credit unions are currently limited to charging no more than 2% interest per month, so to borrow Â£400 over a month would cost just Â£8 in interest. Customers who want the payment on the same day as they apply have to pay an Â£11 fee. Borrowers must live or work within four London boroughs - Westminster, Camden, Southwark or Lambeth. They also have to undertake a short psychometric test as part of the application process. The five questions ask borrowers if they tend to obey rules and worry about what other people think of them. Lakshman Chandrasekera, London Mutual Credit Union's chief executive, said the test helped them make lending decisions: "We are trying to find out if you are the type of person who will borrow and not care about not paying. It is useful. There's a correlation between what they say and what their payment patterns are." The whole application process can be finished in under 10 minutes. Mr Chandrasekera said that applicants were given a fast service: "Our online payday loan facility is exactly the same as any other payday loan service. People can apply for the loan, get the decision there and then, and then get the money within a couple of hours." However, the cost of borrowing is significantly lower than commercial payday lenders. Many would charge more than Â£100 to borrow Â£400 for a month. Mr Chandrasekera said his credit union also makes careful checks to ensure customers will not struggle to repay the loan: "We are doing thorough checks on affordability, so we will make sure this person can afford to pay the loan." Emma took out a loan for Â£100 with CUOK last month in order to buy her children school uniforms which she has agreed to pay back over a three month period, costing her just Â£4.04 in interest: "I'd overspent on holiday with the children. We went through what I had coming in and they worked out what I could afford to pay back. I think within 24 hours I had the money. It was very easy, very straightforward." London Mutual admitted that only one in five applicants like Emma can be approved solely on the basis of the online application process. The other four out of five applicants normally then have to speak to someone over the phone to give additional information. But they would still hope to process the application within 24 hours. Michael regularly used payday loan firms until he discovered he could borrow Â£400 from CUOK: "Payday loan companies are so aggressive. They also charge about 10 times as much as a credit union. I didn't have to stress." Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, says it is important his members speed up their processing of loans but they should still not be too short term: "The sector has just introduced an automated scoring system built on a score card working with the credit reference agencies. We might not be keen on making loans for a 10-day period but we absolutely need to not take 10 days to make a loan." Some industry commentators believe there are strict limits to the extent that credit unions could ever compete with payday lenders. Julian Knight, money editor of the Independent newspaper, says payday lending has grown too big: "They just don't have the scale. The payday lending industry is worth Â£3bn to Â£4bn. It would just be a scratch on the surface." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <body>China's four major cities saw record rise in new home prices in September, stoking fears of a housing bubble. Prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw their biggest jump since the government changed its calculation method in January 2011. Property remains a popular investment choice in China and prices have now risen for nine months in a row. Analysts say Beijing has so far held back on imposing fresh curbs due to concerns over slowing economic growth. However, data released last week showed that China's growth rate picked up in the July-to-September period - the first rise in three quarters. Many believe that with the economy picking up and property prices continuing to rise, policymakers may soon implement measures to control speculation in the sector and also keep price rises in check. Data released by the by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed that new home prices rose in 69 of China's 70 major cities in September. In the capital city of Beijing, new home prices were 16% higher in September than they were a year earlier. In Shanghai, prices rose by 17% compared to a year earlier. The southern manufacturing-based cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw prices rise by 20%. The eastern city of Wenzhou was the only Chinese city to post a decline. Prices fell by 1.7% from last year. </body>

      <title>Lone bid wins Brazil oilfield rights</title>
      <description>Rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield are auctioned to the sole bidder - a Brazilian-led consortium - amid angry clashes in Rio.</description>

      <body>The rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield have been won at an auction by a consortium led by Brazil's state-run Petrobras, backed by Total, Shell and Chinese firms. The group made the only bid in the auction, offering the minimum share of the surplus production. The Rio de Janeiro beachfront hotel, where the auction took place, was guarded by 1,100 security personnel. Earlier, striking oil workers opposed to the contest clashed with police. Eleven companies had expressed interest in the Libra oilfield, but the Spanish Repsol pulled out on Monday, leaving the five winners as the only ones to present a bid. Chinese state companies CNPC and CNOOC offered 10% each, while the French oil giant Total and the Anglo-Dutch Shell held another 20% stake each. Despite the lack of other offers, Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters he was "not one bit frustrated" by the contest having been won by the lowest possible bid. The president of the government's National Petroleum Agency, Magda Chambriard, called the auction an "absolute success". "It is hard to imagine a more successful outcome. These companies are among the world's 10 most valuable in the energy branch," she said. Petrobras offered a 10% stake on top of the 30% it was already entitled to according to the auctioning rules. The consortium secured the rights to explore the Libra's estimated 8-12 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves for 35 years. Heavy security has been in place around the hotel in the western Rio district Barra da Tijuca since Sunday. But violence broke out on Monday morning, as protesters tried to invade the cordoned area close to the hotel. Security officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper bombs at protesters who threw stones and used corrugated iron sheets as shields. The clashes were watched by a crowd spending the public holiday on Barra da Tijuca beach. "There were bizarre scenes. Riot police firing tear gas and stun grenades, not just against protesters, but also on to the beach, with hundreds of tourists and sun worshippers looking on incredulously," the BBC's Wyre Davies reports from Rio de Janeiro. Several protesters were injured. President Dilma Rousseff had ordered tight security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Among the protesters are members of various unions representing oil workers, who have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. The unions accuse the government of "selling off" Brazil's riches. Others argued that the rules set by the government for the auction allowed too much state intervention, scaring off big players such as BP and Exxon. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010. The offshore oilfield is located at a depth of some 5,000m (16,500ft), below a thick layer of rock, sand and salt, which makes its exploration extremely challenging. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. </body>

      <title>Greenspan fears more debt deadlock</title>
      <description>Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan tells the BBC that the US debt ceiling crisis is far from over, that the eurozone needs political union, and "crony capitalism" is growing.</description>

      <body>Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that a repeat of the crisis that brought the country close to default is "perfectly conceivable". He told the BBC that he had not seen another situation in Washington where "compromise" seemed so far away. Mr Greenspan confessed to sympathies with the aims of the Tea Party, the Republican faction that fought the government during debt ceiling talks. But the former central banker said the movement's tactics were "undemocratic". Mr Greenspan, the most powerful figure in economic policy when he ran the Fed between 1987 to 2006, spoke to the BBC's Evan Davis ahead of publication of his new book, The Map and the Territory. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme and the World Service's Business Daily, the former Fed chief had strong words for those who thought the eurozone crisis was over. The crisis is likely to continue until the eurozone sees "consolidation politically. I think that's where we are going". He said: "The culture of Greece is not the same as the culture of Germany, and to fuse them into a single unit is extremely difficult. "The only way you can do it is by political union, like with East and West Germany, and even that is not working as well as it should be." But he was optimistic about the UK's attempt to revive its economy. "What Britain has done with its austerity programme has worked much better than I thought it would," Mr Greenspan said. "As far as I can judge, it [the economy] is coming out pretty much the way they [the coalition government] had expected." Mr Greenspan also defended his record at the Fed against criticism that easy-credit policies and light-touch regulation had contributed substantially to the 2008 financial crash. He also declined to criticise the financial derivatives market. He said: "One thing that shocked me is that not only did the Federal Reserve's very sophisticated model completely miss (the crash on) September 15th, 2008, but so did the IMF, so did JP Morgan, which was forecasting American economic growth three days before the crisis hit, going up all through 2009 and 2010." There is a difference between predicting economic bubbles, and predicting when they might burst, he said. He rejected suggestions that he was not clear enough in warning that the financial markets might be teetering on the edge of collapse. However, his words of warning had to be couched very carefully in order not to unsettle the markets, he said. "I was very worried about what the impact would be." Mr Greenspan, 87, who now runs his own consultancy business, also criticised a growing "crony capitalism" in the US. He said: "Crony capitalism is essentially a condition in whichâ¦ public officials are giving favours to people in the private sector in payment of political favours." He said it was prevalent in China and Russia, but had not been common in the US or the UK. But he added: "I am beginning to worry that we are starting in that direction." On China, he said that growth rates would begin to slow unless the country could be more innovative. "One of the major problems with China is that its innovation is largely borrowed technology. "There was a recent Reuters study where they listed the top 100 most innovative companies. Forty were American, none were Chinese. "Chinese productivity is the highest in the world but the way they do it is by borrowing the technology from abroad, either by joint ventures or other means. "What they are going to find, I suspect sooner rather than later, is thatâ¦ unless they pick up innovation very specifically, their growth is going to slow down," Mr Greenspan said. Part of the problem was that China remained a single-party state which was too conformist, and innovators there still did not "think outside of the box" enough. </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>
      <date>1381964753</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; Â£29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>
      <date>1381878293</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70453000/jpg/_70453204_plane.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (Â£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Milk Cup tournament loses sponsor</title>
      <description>The Milk Cup youth football tournament is dealt a blow after the Dairy Council ends its sponsorship of the competition.</description>

      <body>The Milk Cup youth football tournament has been dealt a blow after the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland ended its sponsorship of the annual competition. A statement from the Dairy Council said that the decision had been taken following a "strategic review" of its activities in Northern Ireland. The Dairy Council began sponsoring the tournament in 1983. "This was not an easy decision for us but no sponsorship is permanent," said Dairy Council chief Mike Johnston. The competition's traditional base over the last 30 years has been Coleraine with games also taking place in Portrush, Portstewart, Ballymoney and Limavady. In more recent years, the finals night has taken place at the Ballymena Showgrounds while there have also been games in places such as Cloughmills and Broughshane. Despite Monday's announcement, tournament chairman Victor Leonard told BBC Sport that planning is already well underway for the 2014 competition and that it would "definitely go ahead" next summer. "The future of the Milk Cup is very secure," added the tournament tournament. "2014 will be a very strong event. We are at an advanced stage with teams and actually looking to enhance the event. "The partnership with the Dairy Council has been a very exciting and very beneficial one but we already have some things going on in the background, preparing for this day." However, there is no doubt that the loss of the main sponsor has to be regarded as a blow for the youth tournament. "The Milk Cup has been a hugely important and successful sponsorship for the Dairy Council since we became involved 30 years ago but the market has evolved," added the Dairy Council chief executive, Mr Johnston. "But we need to ensure that our activities meet the needs of the Northern Ireland dairy industry. "We are delighted that over the past three decades we have played our part in making the Milk Cup one of the top events of its kind in the world. "One of the things that attracted us to the event in the early 1980s was the opportunity it provided for local lads to have the experience of playing against teams from other countries and cultures. "At a time when Northern Ireland was in the grip of a dark period in its history and amidst negative publicity in international media, it will always be a testament to the tournament that teams from all over the world were prepared to come to Northern Ireland." Future stars who have played in the tournament include David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Neil Lennon, Joe Cole and Keith Gillespie. </body>

      <title>'High demand' for Games tickets sale</title>
      <description>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow sees "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking.</description>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <title>I'll step aside - Kilmarnock chairman</title>
      <description>Michael Johnston says he is willing to step down as chairman of Kilmarnock if the right investors can be found.</description>

      <body>Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston says he would step aside from his position if the right investors can be attracted to Rugby Park. Johnston has been under pressure from fans groups to leave the club and was the subject of more protests during Saturday's 2-0 win over Ross County. But he insisted to BBC Scotland that he is open to change. "I'm looking for more local business people to work in partnership for the benefit of the club," said Johnston. "Billy Bowie is the first person since the Moffat family to table an offer of finance." Johnston, who inherited the Scottish Premiership club from the Moffats, revealed that Ayrshire businessman Bowie had invested Â£200,000 in Kilmarnock, with a further Â£1.1m promised. The chairman believes he has more to achieve before leaving Kilmarnock and intends reducing debts of around Â£9m. However, he admitted that, if new investors offer the right money, he would consider his position. Johnston has held talks with the Kilmarnock Futures Consortium and the group is understood to be set to present its takeover plan to the Kilmarnock chairman shortly. Bowie is also believed to be open to working with the consortium headed up by Alan McLeish from the club's kit sponsor, QTS. The 2-0 victory over County was Kilmarnock's first of the season and the first for Allan Johnston, who was appointed manager in the summer. Supporters held up red cards in the 18th and 69th minutes, symbolic of when the club was founded in 1869, in protest at the chairman's running of the club. </body>

      <title>UK QE has failed, says QE inventor</title>
      <description>Where did the phrase 'quantitative easing' come from?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614016</url>

      <body>When the UK embarked on quantitative easing (QE) in March 2009, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Bank of England was expected to administer a monetary stimulus equal to Â£50bn, writes Liam Halligan. Over the past four years, such "extraordinary measures" have extended somewhat more, with the Bank's bond-buying programme now amounting to Â£375bn - almost eight times the original estimate. Since the financial crisis began, the Bank of England's balance sheet has expanded four-fold. But where did the phrase "quantitative easing" come from? Arguably among the most controversial economic policies of recent years, QE is surely the most unpronounceable. Not many Western analysts are aware that this tongue-challenging name originated in Japan, the modern-day spiritual home of money-printing. Even fewer know that the man who coined the phrase comes from Germany - which, of all the big Western economies, has probably the most deep-seated aversion to printing money. In the mid-1990s, Prof Richard Werner, a German academic fluent in Japanese, was working as an economist in Tokyo. Japan's real estate bubble had burst and property and share prices were tumbling. The country was locked in a debate about the use of unconventional monetary policy to support asset prices and boost broader commercial activity. Prof Werner submitted an article to Nikkei, a leading business newspaper, advocating a new type of radical monetary measure. Rather than attempting to shift interest rates, he argued that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan should instead intervene directly to influence the size of the money supply by taking steps to encourage commercial banks to extend more credit. "I was promoting a policy that involved more credit creation, rather than changing the price of money," says Prof Werner. "So when I wrote my article, and after the newspaper's editors insisted on a phrase readers would understand, I added the Japanese adjective for quantity to the standard expression for monetary stimulation. 'Quantitative easing' was the literal translation back into English of these two Japanese words." Prof Werner's article was widely noticed. Several years later, in fact, the Bank of Japan decided to implement extreme monetary measures and adopted the Japanese name the German economist had coined. "In 2001, the Japanese central bank said, 'Now we're actually doing this'," he recalls. "To communicate this to global markets, they had to give the policy a name in English. I suppose the translators had a bad day, or were under time pressure. Normally, you'd try to come up with something slightly more fluent than 'quantitative easing', but they did only a literal translation." While the Bank of Japan adopted the precise name of Prof Werner's policy, it was somewhat less accurate when interpreting his actual proposal. Incredibly, the Japanese version of QE that was eventually implemented was a policy Prof Werner had specifically ruled-out. Prof Werner's argument was that, because more than 95% of the money supply in a modern economy is derived not from cash or reserves, but from private bank lending, it is essential to get banks to lend. So he urged the Japanese government to enter into private long-term agreements to borrow from commercial banks, instead of issuing government debt. The Bank of Japan's version of QE, in contrast, involved creating money out of nothing at the central bank. "That's absolutely not what my policy was about," says Prof Werner. "In my original article, I specifically argued against either lowering interest rates or expanding central bank reserves. That was my whole point - traditional solutions weren't going to work. Actually, it was a bit upsetting." Then, in an additional twist, the Bank of England also later adopted Prof Werner's QE label - but, again, to describe a policy with which he didn't agree. "It was one thing when the Bank of Japan did it, because that was over in Japan and was some time ago," he says. "But once the Bank of England also started using the phrase, I thought 'Hang on - I've got to speak up and make clear that the original definition is quite different.'" The Bank of England's interpretation of QE also involves the creation of central bank credits, as in Japan. But in the UK these have been used to buy government bonds from commercial banks rather than from the government directly. Prof Werner says this is "a little better" than Japanese QE, as it "at least in theory increases commercial banks' reserves". He maintains, though, that the "best way to boost the economy is to increase bank credit", and that can only be guaranteed by governments borrowing from banks directly. "That creates new credit," says Prof Werner. "The money supply then expands, transactions increase, there's more demand, more employment, more tax revenues and suddenly you have a virtuous circle." In both Japan and the UK, QE isn't working, he says, because it doesn't focus on "the most important part of the money supply", which is bank lending. "UK QE has singularly failed, as bank credit is still shrinking." When faced with the claim used by some British banks that the demand for credit is low, Prof Werner is dismissive. "I'm quite used to this argument, because banks in Japan used it for 20 years," he says. "The banks, of course, have become very risk-averse, as they have many non-performing assets." Prof Werner is also critical of the UK's concentrated banking structure - which he argues has made the economy more vulnerable. "British banking is dominated by a small number of big banks - with just five banks controlling 90% of deposits," he says. "Big banks want to lend to big firms and do big deals that give big bonuses. Small firms are too much hassle, and the banks are absolutely not interested - even though small firms need the credit and account for 70% of UK employment. So these small firms are credit-rationed and that's a problem." "In Germany, 70% of deposits are held by 2,000 banks," says Prof Werner. "These local German banks lend a lot more to small- and medium-sized firms, and when the credit crunch happened most of them were fine." When it comes to QE, although his policy recommendations have been misinterpreted in Japan, the UK and elsewhere, Prof Werner maintains his natural sense of humour about giving the world a phrase that's so challenging to say. "It's become a household name anyway and I should get some kind of fee, some royalties, for that," he says with a smile. </body>

      <body>The economy of Burma, officially called Myanmar, is open for business. That's the message the reformist government of President Thein Sein is sending out, and it has got an overwhelmingly positive response from investors. But behind the impressive headline figures of planned ventures and promised aid, who is actually doing well in the new Burma? There have been some high-profile announcements - Nissan and Suzuki want to manufacture cars, Ford has opened a dealership, Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But many foreign investors are waiting both for infrastructure to improve and for greater political certainty before jumping in. The indigenous Burmese business community, on the other hand, has been a hive of activity. Inevitably, the companies best placed to profit from the new opportunities are the so-called cronies - those who built up their businesses through close co-operation with the old military regime. Despite still being listed on US sanctions lists, with their resources and experience, they are winning many of the new infrastructure contracts. Smaller companies, though, are cashing in on booming demand for property, consumer goods and services. Wai Thit Lwin, a graduate from Berkeley in her 20s, juggles looking after her two young daughters, expanding a local chain of 50 convenience stores, and helping manage a company that operates hospitals, hotels, and markets brands such as Sony and LG in Burma. Everything she is involved in is growing fast. Her main concerns? The inadequacy of Burma's banking system - local companies have to pay punishing interest rates for capital - and the threat of competition from the convenience store giant 7-11. Then there was Cho Thet Nwe, who left school to help bring up her brothers, but is now the brand manager for the French cosmetics company L'Oreal. "When we started selling European products here in 1996, it was so difficult," she recalls. "Back then the whole family would use the same soap, from head to toe. We were trying to sell facial foams and shampoo - we had to start educating them from zero. But now lifestyles have changed tremendously." One of the most conspicuous improvements in consumer choice is the availability of mobile phones. When I first reported from Burma 12 years ago only a tiny elite were allowed to buy mobiles. The phones themselves were heavy, ancient, first generation models. Today Sim cards are available, although still in limited numbers and for a much higher price than in neighbouring countries. And you can buy pretty much any model of phone, from the numerous, glaringly lit shops in Rangoon (also known as Yangon). Myat Thiri Khaing studied Chinese at university, intending to work as a translator. Instead she joined one of Burma's first phone retailers, Lu Gyi Min, excited by the possibilities of technology. Today she is the manager of the busy Latha Street branch, doing evening classes in management to improve her chances of promotion. The business is growing quickly, she told me, especially outside Rangoon, where they have plans to open more branches. But amid these positive stories, the majority of Burmese have yet to feel any material benefits from the reforms. And there are some who feel they are losing out in this new and unpredictable environment. A few kilometres from downtown Rangoon is south Dagon, designated an industrial zone back in the days of military rule. Part of it is given over to rows of small iron foundries, operating the most primitive technology. Sweat-grimed workers pull glowing strips of metal from open furnaces, and toss them expertly to others who catch them with tongs, and run them through clattering presses. I met U Mitthya, who assembles small pick-up trucks, his workers welding them by hand. In the days of military rule, when car imports were tightly restricted, it was a good business. Now as inexpensive vehicle imports flood in, it is no longer a viable business. He said the three trucks in his workshop were probably the last he would make. The big plans to expand Burma's industrial base have caused casualties too. The most ambitious project is a planned industrial estate next to the port of Thilawa, south of Rangoon, to provide an area of reliable power and suitable infrastructure for Japanese manufacturers. But this requires moving the people who have been living on the land for many years. Daw Htay Htay and a few of her neighbours say that under military rule they had been forced to give up their land for paltry compensation. But as the planned project never took off, they simply carried on cultivating it. Now the government wants to start construction of Thilawa, as early as the end of this year. It has offered the value of six years' rice harvests, and an alternative plot of land. Daw Htay Htay says she is being put under pressure by officials to accept, but feels the compensation is not enough. In this time of change, she told me: "I feel it is only we who are losing." But it is not only her. Land disputes have erupted all over the country, as new economic opportunities make previously worthless land valuable again. This is an emotional issue, with the potential to overshadow much of the good news that is coming out of Burma these days. </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; Â£945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet accessâ¦ so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Nuclear strike price</title>
      <description>What is the strike price and why is it needed?</description>

      <body>The government has finally agreed a nuclear strike price with French power company EDF. But what is this price and why is it needed? Nuclear what price? No-one is talking about a nuclear strike here - Armageddon is not upon us. The nuclear strike price simply refers to the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced from its proposed new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset. Why do we need a strike price in the first place? Because the government has maintained all along that it will not provide any public subsidies to the nuclear industry. It would not actually be illegal to do so, but the coalition would need permission from the European Union. Any such u-turn would be hugely embarrassing, however, not to mention hugely unpopular. How does the price work in practice? In essence, the government has guaranteed EDF a price of Â£92.50 per megawatt hour (Mwh), so if the market price of electricity falls below this level, the government has in effect said it will make sure EDF receives the difference between the two prices. The wholesale price of electricity at the moment is about Â£45/Mwh. If the wholesale price remains at this level, then EDF will receive an additional Â£47.50/Mwh. In practice, this money will not come from taxpayers (that would count as a subsidy), but from consumers of electricity. The strike price works the other way as well - EDF has to refund the difference if the price of electricity is above Â£92.50/Mwh. For example, if the wholesale price is Â£110/Mwh, then it has to refund Â£18.50/Mwh. Again, this money goes back to bill payers, not to the government. The strike price will fall from Â£92.50 to Â£89.50 if EDF agrees to develop another new reactor in Sizewell, Suffolk. This simply reflects the fact that EDF's costs will be lower per reactor if it builds two of them. But why the need for any guaranteed price? Nuclear reactors cost a lot of money, and EDF wants to build two of them. The final bill is estimated at Â£16bn. Even for a massive company like EDF, this is a huge investment, which makes it inherently risky. For example, if the price of electricity falls, or becomes more volatile, the company could lose a lot of money. And because the plant would take 10 years to build, there is simply too much uncertainty to commit to such a huge investment. For this reason, EDF needs an added incentive to build the reactors. Knowing it will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity generated at Hinkley provides some kind of certainty that the investment will be worthwhile - in other words, profitable. For its part, the government has been unable to play different energy companies off against each other, as German power giants RWE and E.On have decided against building new plants in the UK. It has, therefore, been forced to negotiate with EDF. But this doesn't mean EDF holds all the cards - the company is desperate to get Hinkley Point C started so it can serve as a blueprint for similar power stations across the world. So what does it mean for bills? Until we know the price of electricity on the open market when Hinkley Point C starts generating power, we simply won't know. If the electricity price is below the strike price, then bills will probably go up. If it is above the strike price, then bills could go down. It will also depend on the energy mix at the time, in other words how much of your electricity is generated by nuclear power. At the moment, almost 20% of the UK's power is generated by nuclear reactors, but this is likely to fall in the short term as the UK's current nuclear capacity is decommissioned. This is all very well, but why are we building new nuclear power plants? Precisely because there will be a shortfall in electricity generation as a result of existing nuclear power stations going offline. The question then is how to make up this shortfall. The government is committed to renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, but to get enough generating capacity from these sources will take too long, so another solution is needed. In theory, it could simply increase power generation from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and gas, but stringent, legally-binding CO2 emissions targets mean this is not possible. There is some room for an increase in gas-generated power, but as we import most of this gas, the government has concerns about energy security - it wants us to generate our own power, not rely on others for it. So, in the government's eyes, that leaves nuclear. And it wants EDF to lead by example, paving the way for other power companies to invest in new reactors in the UK, because two new reactors will not be enough. </body>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (Â£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (Â£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>How heavily marketed New Zealand apples are winning in UK</description>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was Â£1.95/kg, Cox Â£1.75/kg and Pink Lady Â£3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink LadyÂ® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is room for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May says vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea". The campaign had resulted in the return of some illegal immigrants but it was too much of a "blunt instrument," she added. Speaking in the Commons, at the second reading of the government's Immigration Bill, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid", and Labour accused the government of aping language used by the far-right National Front in the 1970s. UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted that the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it to other parts of the country. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said he was "very pleased" the idea was being axed, describing it as "deeply inappropriate". Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett told the same programme the pilot had failed and the evidence showed it had made no difference to legitimate efforts to tackle illegal immigration. A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. The chairman of the committee, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. </body>

      <description>Police in the Republic of Ireland remove a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin.</description>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive. It is believed it will make an application to the courts for a temporary care order. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>Syria talks 'must bolster moderates'</title>
      <description>The UK foreign secretary urges Arab and Western nations to encourage unity among Syria's moderate opposition and keep out extremists, at talks in London.</description>

      <body>Bolstering Syria's moderate opposition is crucial to excluding extremists from power in the war-gripped country, the UK's foreign secretary has said. William Hague was speaking as Arab and Western foreign ministers gathered for talks with Syrian opposition officials. The London talks are trying to lay the groundwork for planned peace negotiations in Geneva next month. But a key group in Syria's main opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the meeting dubbed Geneva II. The Syrian National Council (SNC) has been unwilling to talk to representatives of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ministers will say unity is vital among the fractured groups of Syria's armed and political opposition if peace talks are to have any chance of success. In London, foreign ministers from 11 countries - the so-called Friends of Syria group - are trying to encourage opposition groups "to have a united position" ahead of Geneva II, Mr Hague told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Hague admitted that an increasingly prominent role was being played in Syria by Islamist rebels linked to al-Qaeda, who are engaged in no kind of peace process and who have been involved in bitter struggles with more moderate forces. "The reason we have to make sure we are supporting and dealing with the moderate opposition committed to a democratic, pluralistic, non-sectarian future for Syria is precisely because if they don't have a role, then all the Syrian people have got left is a choice between Assad and extremists," Mr Hague said. "The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes. That's why we're making a renewed effort" with Geneva II, Mr Hague said. At Tuesday's talks, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to reaffirm their view that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the Assad regime. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague said he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role" - but that required Iran to back a "transitional government in Syria made up of regime and opposition, by mutual consent". Earlier, the US Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that Syria's opposition would never agree to President Assad staying in power. "He has bombed and gassed people in his country. How can that man claim to rule under any legitimacy in the future?" he said, dismissing suggestions that Mr Assad could stand for re-election in 2014. But President Assad reportedly told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen in comments reported by AFP news agency. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. On Monday, the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, said it was postponing until early November meetings to decide whether to attend the Geneva II conference. The opposition has been further weakened by fighting between the moderate Free Syrian Army and Islamist rebel groups. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort in Syria, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. The National Coalition has insisted that President Assad play no role in a transitional authority - something the Syrian government has rejected. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. </body>

Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985 in June. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal. An independent forfeiture committee decides whether recipients should lose honours if they have brought the system into disrepute.

      <description>David Cameron brands Facebook irresponsible for allowing beheading videos to appear on its site without warnings.</description>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has waded into an escalating row about Facebook's decision to allow videos showing people being decapitated back on its pages. He tweeted that it was "irresponsible" of the social network to post such videos without warning. Facebook reversed a temporary ban on such videos, saying users should be free to watch and condemn such content. The move was also condemned by one of the website's advertisers. The row gained momentum when Mr Cameron tweeted: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Car-sharing firm Zipcar told the BBC it was disappointed that its adverts had appeared next to one of the videos. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. The BBC was alerted to the fact that such content was back online by a reader who said the firm was refusing to remove a page showing a clip of a masked man killing a woman, which is believed to have been filmed in Mexico. It was posted last week under the title, Challenge: Anybody can watch this video? The social network later confirmed it was allowing such material to be posted again. "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," said a spokeswoman. "However, since some people object to graphic video of this nature, we are working to give people additional control over the content they see. This may include warning them in advance that the image they are about to see contains graphic content." But the decision has been criticised by its own advisors and law enforcers. The chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, Stephen Balkam - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "surprised" and "unhappy" at the move and would be contacting the firm to make clear his concerns. After being contacted by a member of the local community, the South Australia Police (Sapol) force has also registered a complaint with Facebook about a video showing the decapitation of a woman. Facebook advised Sapol it would not be removing the video. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Facebook advised us that they had reviewed the video and found, 'It did not violate our community standard on graphic violence'. Our team then spoke with a representative of Facebook about the decision, but were advised that the video would remain in place as a platform for community debate. "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save Â£500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS Â£2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra Â£500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a Â£200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise Â£200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between Â£60m and Â£80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is Â£20m-Â£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further Â£50m-Â£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" Â£500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just Â£73m a year is recouped out of more than Â£460m at present. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the proposed new levy would apply to all non-EEA nationals - regardless of whether their country has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's Â£500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed Â£200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than Â£200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <title>UK aims to claw back EU welfare cash</title>
      <description>The UK is examining ways to claim back cash for welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries, the BBC understands.</description>

      <body>The UK is examining ways to claw back welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries from their home government, the BBC understands. A levy could be put in place so that for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, the government would be able to reclaim any benefits paid out. The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was "possible to return to the system". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a "right to reside" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be "habitually resident". Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims "might not raise huge sums," the senior Foreign Office source said, "but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring. In January 2014, restrictions that have applied to migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK will expire. Meanwhile, the UK is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK. It is alleged the extra UK "right to reside" test to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. The government has said it will fight the court case robustly. Ministers are keen to be seen to be adopting a muscular approach to immigration, given how big a priority opinion polls suggest it is to many voters, and the recent strong performances of the UK Independence Party. </body>

      <body>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is accused of carrying out the offences between 1976 and 2008. The allegations relate to 11 female complainants, aged between 15 and 29 at the time. The 68-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court under his real name, David Patrick Griffin. His trial date was set for 14 January 2014. It is expected to last five to six weeks. Mr Travis, of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree officers in November last year. The Metropolitan Police investigation was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile. The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others". Mr Travis's arrest fell within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation. He is currently on bail on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims. Mr Travis denied the following counts in court on Tuesday: </body>

      <body>A would-be bridegroom who made a hoax bomb threat to a wedding venue after realising he had failed to confirm his booking has been jailed. Neil McArdle, 36, of Medbourne Crescent, Liverpool, realised his error the day before he was due to marry at St George's Hall in the city in April. Rather than tell fiancee Amy Williams, he made a bomb-threat call from a phone box, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was given a 12-month jail sentence after admitting making the hoax call. McArdle could not face telling Miss Williams, the "love of his life", that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen, the court heard. So as she got dressed on the morning of the wedding he slipped out of the house, went to a phone box and, disguising his voice, told the receptionist at Liverpool Register Office, which is part of St George's Hall: "This is not a hoax call. "There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" and the building was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. Miss Williams was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party. But his would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Miss Williams's sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and McArdle was arrested the same day, admitting to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked and staged the bomb scare after bungling the wedding booking forms. He later pleaded guilty to communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Miss Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. Barrister Charles Lander, defending, said: "If it wasn't so serious the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." However, he said McArdle realised this was "no laughing matter". Judge Norman Wright said it was an "extremely serious" case, with custody the only appropriate sentence. </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested Â£150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBCâ¦ was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around Â£5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost Â£2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new Â£150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <title>Scottish Power to pay Â£8.5m penalty</title>
      <description>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling. Ofgem said customers were misled during sales approaches due to Scottish Power's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. Consumers on the "warm home discount" will receive about Â£50 each. Money will also go to those who were misled. The company has apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012. "Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations," said Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison. Scottish Power will pay Â£7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty. It estimates each will receive a payment of about Â£50. It has also set up a Â£1m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. "Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers," the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. "We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected," said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. "This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. "However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. "Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored." Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling. In April, Ofgem said that SSE was guilty of management failures that led to "prolonged and extensive" mis-selling through telephone, in-store and doorstep sales. The regulator handed down a record Â£10.5m fine. Two other investigations - into Npower and E.On, are ongoing. Energy companies no longer sell energy door-to-door, a change that has reduced the number of people switching suppliers in recent times, figures show. Also on Tuesday, new rules from Ofgem came into force preventing energy firms from increasing prices during fixed-term contracts. Firms are also banned from automatically rolling customers on to another fixed-term offer when their current one ends. Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. "Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. "Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them," added Mr Wright. The reform follows Ofgem's research showing that even on fixed-term deals, suppliers could still increase prices. </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>
      <date>1382428725</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently announced Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Android and iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. Nokia added that the inclusion of four microphones in the higher-end 1520 should appeal to consumers interested in making recordings of school concerts and other events with multiple sources of sound. In addition, a new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. Nokia has suggested Microsoft would bring its Skydrive cloud storage service and ability to link up to Xbox games consoles to the handsets following the takeover. But one market watcher questioned their future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform and end Asha out sooner rather than later." </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>It's the height of the British apple season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz?</description>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was Â£1.95/kg, Cox Â£1.75/kg and Pink Lady Â£3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink LadyÂ® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <title>Six tricks to revive old food</title>
      <description>Tesco has revealed more than two thirds of salad grown for bags is thrown out. What can be done to prolong the life of food?</description>

      <body>Tesco has revealed more than two thirds of salad grown for bags is thrown out. What can be done to prolong the life of food, asks Kathryn Westcott. Forty per cent of apples and just under half of bakery items are also uneaten. So what kitchen tricks can help? Dampen the outside of a loaf of bread that has gone hard with a little bit of water and pop it in a hot oven - about 180C (350F) - for about five or 10 minutes, says food writer Stefan Gates. Baguettes that are past their best are regularly cut into 1/2cm slices in the Gates' household and put into a warm oven (about 50C, 120F) for about 15 to 20 minutes. "We use them as a form of biscuit for cheese," says Gates. "They can be stored in a sealed plastic bag." Limp biscuits can also be revived in the oven. Five minutes in a hot oven (180C, 350F) should do it. This new-found freshness won't last, though. There are a number of tricks for keeping lettuce fresh and crisp. Lovefoodhatewaste.com suggests separating the leaves and storing them in a bowl of water in the fridge. Replace the water every couple of days. Culinary tips and tricks blog The Kitchn, however, favours the "bath towel method", which entails cutting up greens, washing them, putting them in a salad spinner and spreading them on a clean towel to air dry for a few hours. Roll up the towel with the greens inside and secure with rubber bands. Just take out what you need for that day and bundle it up again, it suggests. "Packet lettuce is preserved in gas and once it starts to go off, nothing will revive it," says chef Clarissa Dickson Wright. But she says a Cos or Little Gem can be revived by leaving in really cold water - maybe with some ice cubes in - and leaving overnight." Otherwise, she says, make lettuce soup. "Fry some onion and garlic, add stock and toss in the lettuce leaves. Top with croutons made from your old bread," she says. Cucumber that has gone limp can be revived by chopping off the end and standing it in cold water, according to Love Food Hate Waste. It also suggests freezing cheese and milk. Grate the cheese first and then put it straight from the freezer into sauces or lasagnes, etc. Dickson Wright also suggests freezing bananas for ice cream. Peel them first then whizz them in a food processor. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

In-from Scarlet Scott Williams is tipped to fill that centre spot alongside Jonathan Davies while Walker's chances of a Test debut are boosted by British and Irish Lion Cuthbert's absence. Blues centre Owen Williams and fly-half Rhys Patchell stay involved at senior level having been among a host of fresh faces who drew their June Test series in Japan 1-1. Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips also remains, having toured Japan. Phillips' former Parc y Scarlets hooking rival, Matthew Rees, is out of contention as he is scheduled to undergo testicular surgery that has forced him to take time out from the game. Ospreys tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis returns after recovering from a knee injury suffered during Wales' 2012 autumn series. Walker was named in Wales' 2013 Six Nations squad, but injuries forced him out and he also missed the trip to Japan. Blues centre Allen comes in after impressive early-season form, including a fine performance in their triumph over European champions Toulon. An unexpected consideration for Gatland was Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips having to go in front of the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations that he attended a video analysis session while under the influence of alcohol. If found guilty, the player could face a club suspension and fine, but that would not affect Phillips' Wales availability. However, the emergence of former Wales Under-20 scrum-half Williams is a big plus. The Ammanford product has won selection for Scarlets' Heineken Cup matches against Harlequins and Racing Metro ahead of two other promising number nines, Gareth Davies and Aled Davies. Wales' series kicks off against South Africa on 9 November, continuing against Argentina on 16 November, Tonga the following Friday, and against Australia eight days later on 30 November. Gatland said: "We have an important campaign ahead as we look to test ourselves against some of the best sides in the world but also add strength in depth to our squad as we look to the future. "We face a huge game against South Africa first up and they will be coming to us after an impressive Rugby Championship campaign. "Recent matches between us have been very close and physical and that will be a great test for us to kick-off. "All four matches will be a stern test but we are looking forward to the challenge and looking forward to seeing what we can do on this stage. "The Rugby World Cup is less than two years away, so we are looking to build as much depth in our squad as possible and to give vital international experience to our players." South Africa announce their squad on Monday, 28 October. Forwards: Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Adam Jones (Ospreys), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Paul James (Bath), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Bevington (Ospreys), Richard Hibbard (Ospreys), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Luke Charteris (Perpignan), Ian Evans (Ospreys), Bradley Davies (Cardiff Blues), Andrew Coombs (Dragons), Ryan Jones (Ospreys), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), Toby Faletau (Dragons), Dan Lydiate (Racing Metro). Backs: Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Bayonne), Lloyd Williams (Cardiff Blues), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Patchell (Cardiff Blues), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Jon Davies (Scarlets), Ashley Beck (Ospreys), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Owen Williams (Cardiff Blues), James Hook (Perpignan), George North (Northampton Saints), Eli Walker (Ospreys), Leigh Halfpenny (Cardiff Blues), Liam Williams (Scarlets). </body>

      <body>Scott Johnson says he has picked a training squad for the autumn internationals with the 2015 Rugby World Cup in mind. The interim Scotland head coach has named five uncapped players in his 41-man squad for the games against Japan, South Africa and Australia next month. "We want to continue building a depth to the squad," he told BBC Scotland at Murrayfield. "I have a duty of care to do that 24 months out from the World Cup." Mark Bennett, Jonny Gray and Chris Fusaro have been rewarded for Glasgow Warriors' impressive start to the season with a call-up for next week's training sessions in Glasgow ahead of the three Tests. And London Irish back-row pair Kieran Low, 22, and Blair Cowan, 27, are also called up as they, too, hope to win their first caps. "I've been impressed with what I've seen from Mark Bennett and Jonny Gray," added Johnson. "They've been consistent, which is often a challenge for younger players, and they've shown the resolve to get better." Scotland play Japan on 9 November, then welcome South Africa on 17 November and Australia six days later. Bennett, Gray and Fusaro are just three of 18 Warriors to make the squad, which also features 10 players from Edinburgh and 13 players from England, France and Wales. Johnson, who has surprisingly left out the Glasgow flanker Tyrone Holmes after his man-of-the-match performance in the Heineken Cup last Sunday, said he has had no contact from fly-half Tommaso Allan despite calling him on Monday morning. Allan has represented Scotland at age-grade level but is in the Italy training squad for their November Tests. Scotland training squad for autumn Tests: Backs: Mark Bennett (Glasgow Warriors), Chris Cusiter (Glasgow Warriors), Nick De Luca (Edinburgh), Alex Dunbar (Glasgow Warriors), Max Evans (Castres), Tom Heathcote (Bath), Ruaridh Jackson (Glasgow Warriors), Sean Lamont (Glasgow Warriors), Greig Laidlaw (Edinburgh), Sean Maitland (Glasgow Warriors), Henry Pyrgos (Glasgow Warriors), Matt Scott (Edinburgh), Tommy Seymour (Glasgow Warriors), Duncan Taylor (Saracens), Greig Tonks (Edinburgh), Tim Visser (Edinburgh), Duncan Weir (Glasgow Warriors) Forwards: John Barclay (Scarlets), John Beattie (Montpellier), Kelly Brown (Saracens), Blair Cowan (London Irish), Geoff Cross (Edinburgh), David Denton (Edinburgh), Alasdair Dickinson (Edinburgh), Ross Ford (Edinburgh), Chris Fusaro (Glasgow Warriors), Grant Gilchrist (Edinburgh), Ryan Grant (Glasgow Warriors), Jonny Gray (Glasgow Warriors), Richie Gray (Castres), Jim Hamilton (Montpellier), Rob Harley (Glasgow Warriors), Alastair Kellock (Glasgow Warriors), Scott Lawson (Newcastle Falcons), Kieran Low (London Irish), Moray Low (Glasgow Warriors), Pat MacArthur (Glasgow Warriors), Euan Murray (Worcester Warriors), Alasdair Strokosch (Perpignan), Tim Swinson (Glasgow Warriors), Jon Welsh (Glasgow Warriors) </body>

      <title>Blatter could be succeeded by Webb</title>
      <description>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has indicated he could be replaced "in the near future" by Concacaf leader Jeffrey Webb.</description>

      <body>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has indicated he could be replaced "in the near future" as the head of football's world governing body by Jeffrey Webb. Webb, a Fifa vice-president, is leader of the confederation for North, Central America and the Caribbean (Concacaf). The comments to a football conference in the Caribbean are another hint that Blatter does not want Uefa president Michel Platini to succeed him. Blatter, 77, has led the Zurich-based governing body since 1998. Speaking off-the-cuff before a speech to mark the opening of a Concacaf sport summit, the Fifa boss was introduced incorrectly to an audience of regional political leaders and confederation delegates as "Fifa's vice-president" by a local media officer. Blatter stepped up to the lectern and replied to the mistake by telling the media officer and assembled guests: "I think you're a prophet." "[There may be] a new Fifa president in the near future and this president could be Jeffrey Webb." After receiving applause, he added: "This would not mean I would be vice-president. Once you have been a horse you don't go back to the stable." Sources close to Fifa have told BBC Sport that the comments should not be taken as a decision by Blatter that he will not stand as a candidate in the next election, scheduled for May 2015, and that all options are still open to him. Blatter told Uefa delegates in 2011 that this would be his final term of office but has this year given strong indications that he may seek a fresh mandate. The comments are the clearest indication so far that Platini - considered by many observers to be his most likely successor - is not the man Blatter wishes to see in power after he has left the role. Platini has yet to decide if he will stand in the 2015 election saying recently that he wanted more time to consider the matter. That leaves Jeffrey Webb - who is also yet to indicate any intention to stand in the ballot - as Blatter's anointed executive, having already been appointed by him earlier this year to lead Fifa's anti-discrimination and racism task-force. Webb, 49, is from the Cayman Isles and was elected president of Concacaf in May 2012Â  following the acrimonious departures of former president Jack Warner and general secretary Chuck Blazer. Now one of seven Fifa vice-presidents, Webb started his time in football governance as president of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991. </body>

      <title>Serena favourite for Istanbul finale</title>
      <description>Serena Williams will aim to win her 11th title of a remarkable season at the season-ending WTA Championships in Istanbul.</description>

      <body>Serena Williams starts a strong favourite to win a second successive WTA Championships as the end-of-season finale begins in Istanbul on Tuesday. The world number one has only lost four matches and won 10 titles this season, more than any other year of her career. She will face Petra Kvitova, Agnieszka Radwanska and Angelique Kerber in the group stages in Turkey. "It's a tough group," Williams said. "That's the thing about this event, you have to be ready from the first match." Eight of the top nine in the world rankings - world number three Maria Sharapova is injured - are split into two groups of four, with the top two in each qualifying for the semi-finals. Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who has beaten Williams twice this year, heads the other group, which includes China's Li Na, Sara Errani of Italy and Serb Jelena Jankovic. Three group matches will be played on each of the first four days. Tuesday's opening day sees Belarusian Azarenka start against Errani (15:00 BST) before Williams faces Germany's Kerber (17:00 BST) and Radwanska of Poland plays the Czech Republic's Kvitova (19:00 BST). Williams, 32, won the French Open and US Open this year to take her total of Grand Slam titles to 17, one short of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert and five behind Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22. "I never thought I would have one of my best years this year, and now there is an opportunity to do even better," she added. "I'm still looking to improve and...I have a lot of room for improvement. I am interested for next year to take my game to a new level, which I think I can do. "It's going to be even tough for me to get to 18 [ Grand Slams]. Obviously that's my goal, but I take it one match at a time." The American is aiming to become the first player to defend a WTA Championships crown since Justine Henin in 2007. If she achieves the feat, it would be her fourth title overall. While Kvitova, who won in 2011, is a dangerous opponent on a fast indoor surface, neither she nor Radwanska has ever beaten Williams, while Kerber can boast one victory from their three previous meetings. Jankovic is the only player to qualify this year who was not in the field 12 months ago. The Serb is back among the top eight of the season for the first time since 2010. </body>

      <title>Ainslie answers your questions</title>
      <description>Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie answers your questions about the America's Cup, Chinese food and his love of moths.</description>

      <body>Sir Ben Ainslie added another notable achievement to his legendary sailing career by helping Oracle Team USA fight back from 8-1 down to win the America's Cup last month. The victory over Team New Zealand continued Ainslie's success on water. He is the most decorated Olympic sailor with medals in five consecutive games, including a fourth gold at London 2012. Ainslie, 36, came ashore this week to answer questions posed by contributors to BBC Sport. Which provides the sterner test, your competitors or the sea? Edward Jones â@nejones_ That is a very good question. It is both. Sailing is about making the least mistakes and dealing with conditions and your competitors. It is a little bit like golf in that respect. You never sail a perfect race like you never play a perfect game of golf and normally the people who come out on top make the least mistakes. I would say sailing is probably more to do with dealing with the conditions as a competitor and secondly dealing with the competition. It can be very tactical, especially as the competition comes to the end of the event as you saw in the Olympics last year. You start realising who your main competition are towards the end of the event and you do focus on them more and at that point the racing is much more tactical. One of the dangers is you get too focused on one individual or one team and you forget about the conditions and what is happening outside the boat, with the wind and the water. You make a mistake and a rival sails past you. People often describe sailing as like chess on water because of the tactics of it. There is a lot of strategy involved and you have to be thinking the whole time about what the next move is. Was New Zealand's near-capsize in race eight the most identifiable moment when momentum of the America's Cup flipped to USA and you went on to win? De'Kurt La'Liedtke â@Keeerrrttt1 Definitely. That race was the first time we had shown some good upwind speed and previously that is where we had been weaker than the Kiwis and we actually surprised them a little bit. I don't know if that is necessarily why they had a bad tack and nearly capsized but we got back into them and won that race and for all of us on that boat it was a turning point. You've done match racing at every level, how about a Volvo around the world campaign? Henry Nicholson-Cole â@Henry_NC I love the Volvo race. My dad competed in the first ever around the world race, which back then was called the Whitbread Around the World Race, back in 1973. So growing up as a youngster I had all the stories around that, which was very inspiring. I have done quite a lot of offshore racing but I have not had the opportunity to try the Volvo - maybe it is something I can do in the future. The Olympics and the America's Cup have been my focus up until now in my career so the Volvo is something I have not had time to have a crack at. Have you ever thought of moving into the International Moths since seeing the hydro-foiling at the America's Cup? Alex Sharp â@SPAM_Official That is a very good point because certainly with the America's Cup with the foiling, when the boats are lifting up on the foils, is what moth sailing is all about. Those guys are leading the way in that style of sailing so in terms of training or preparation for the bigger America's Cup boats the moth is a very good tool. I can imagine I will be doing a lot of moth sailing in the coming years. The moths are so much fun to sail. It is like windsurfing, you are flying around at 40 miles an hour in a tiny little craft which is up on foils. They are very dynamic, very fast, a lot of fun. It is a totally different style of racing to what you see in, for example, the finn boat which I sailed in the Olympics. It is a new development of sailing and something that is a great training tool for the future. Since you support Chelsea, what do you think of their prospect this season with the return of the Special One? Sivan John â@SivanJohn I think their prospects are good. I am a big Jose Mourinho fan. It sounds like he has got himself into a little bit of trouble in the last week but I think that is all part of his game. I hope this time he can stay for a while and really build up a strong team again. His man-management is very good. The players you would want to have around you respond very well to him and have a lot of respect for him - guys like Frank Lampard for example. They have a tremendous working relationship and I think that is what you need as a manager, you need those key players around you that you can trust and they are going to help you build the squad. Why did you take up sailing? Jammy â@jammy_jnr My parents were keen on sailing. They didn't really race apart from that first Whitbread and from then on they sailed socially. They got my sister and me into it from a young age messing about on boats socially. I didn't really start racing until I was eight at my local sailing club Restronguet in Cornwall. I went one step at a time, I just enjoyed being on the water. Then a guy called Dr Phil Slater, whose kids were a similar age, started teaching us all to race and I took it from there. Why do you always have a Chinese meal before racing? Lucas Ramsey â@lucasramsey_ That is something I haven't done so much in recent years but when I was younger I was really into having a Chinese meal. It something I did with my parents when I was a youngster and we thought it was a lucky thing having a Chinese meal before an event started and it was a nice thing to do socially so we stuck with it for quite a number of years. My favourite dish is definitely spare ribs. Could you be tempted to compete in the Rio Olympics and what would it take? Phil Crawley @PhilCrawley I don't think so. I made that call last year to retire from Olympic sailing. London 2012 was such an amazing experience and I don't think you will ever top that in terms of Olympics and racing on home water. Also, I have other ambitions in racing with the America's Cup and perhaps some other races. I still think it is the right call. I am happy with that and of course I will support the next Olympic team 100%. Anything I can do to help I would love to. Other than your own achievement, what part of London 2012 did you most enjoy? Phil: @philclements The closing ceremony. It was a pretty stressful event for anyone competing at home. It was amazing the difference from competing in an Olympics away from home, where you train and then go into a little bubble and you just get on with it. Competing at home, the distractions were so much more it made it pretty difficult to prepare and stay focused and not get pulled from pillar to post. I loved watching other competitions. Halfway through my competition I wasn't doing particularly well at that point and I remember watching Helen Glover and Heather Stanning winning in the rowing doubles and then Bradley Wiggins smashing the time trial and that was really inspiring to see those results. That had helped a lot of us who were still competing to get motivated and be part of that winning team. London 2012 was probably the most pressurised situation I have been in. There were the external pressures because we were racing at home. Then internally, the chance to win a medal at home was huge. A fifth medal would have meant quite a lot in the history of sailing as well, so that was a huge amount of internal pressure to achieve that goal. It was a stressful period. Who was your most inspirational coach? And Why? Matt @MDGelly10 I have had some fantastic coaches over the years. I mentioned Phil Slater at a young age who made a huge difference. A guy called Jim Saltonstall, again when I was a youngster he was a huge character. He was a national coach. He helped a lot of the top sailors you have seen come through the Olympics. Iain Percy, Nick Rodgers, Paul Robertson, Shirley Robertson - all these guys were coached by Jim and he was a huge inspiration to our generation of sailors. Finally David Howlett who was my coach for two Olympics and this last one in London. A fantastic guy and certainly I wouldn't have achieved the last Olympics without his support. </body>

Liverpool Youth Court had been told the 15-year-old boy acted as if he was in a "real-life video game". The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was described in court as a "model pupil". The court heard he stole more than Â£2,000 from a branch of Barclays in Liverpool on 20 September. He was handed to the police by his mother, who was shocked to find cash, stained with dye, and a fake gun in his bedroom. The teenager pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery last month and one count of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental ill health. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 200 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An on-going dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". The owners of the Grangemouth complex are to meet later to decide on the plant's fate. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite union said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Senior figures at Ineos, which operates and owns most of the 2.6 sq-mile site, are to consider the workforce's response to the offer. In doing so, they will also look at the patterns of the result across the plant, and across its varied technical skills. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." The plan includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined contribution scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support the plan at this stage would receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning covering Central, Tayside, Fife, Strathclyde, the Borders, south west Scotland and the Borders. Flood alerts and warnings are in place for parts of Tayside, Ayrshire, Central and Dumfries and Galloway. A number of roads across the country have also been closed as a result of the downpours. A fallen tree and power cable blocked the B725 Dalton to Hoddom road in Dumfries and Galloway. Many roads were severely flooded, including the A737 which was closed between Kilbarchan and Howwood in Renfrewshire. Surface water has caused problems on the M74 in the Lanarkshire area and drivers have also been warned to take care on all routes in Dumfries and Galloway. Train passengers faced cancellations and delays through Anniesland and Westerton in Glasgow because of flooding. Flooding between Dalmuir and Garscadden was also disrupting trains through those stations to Motherwell, Springburn and Lanark. Corsehill Primary in North Ayrshire has been closed as a result of the bad weather. The worst of the rain was expected to have passed by early afternoon. </body>

      <body>An attack that left a County Armagh student brain damaged lasted just three minutes, a court has heard. The trial of Heriberto Viramontes, 34, heard from a woman who said she was with him the night Natasha McShane and her friend were robbed and beaten. He is accused of attempting to murder the women in Chicago in April 2010. The prosecution witness, Marcy Cruz, said she stayed in a van smoking marijuana as the defendant went to "rob some women". Ms McShane and her friend, Stacy Jurich, were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago on 23 April 2010. Marcy Cruz has pleaded guilty to her role in the attack. She testified against Mr Viramontes on Monday as part of a plea deal, and said she expected to serve 19 years of a 22-year sentence. Cruz told Cook County Criminal Court that they had been driving in her van in the Bucktown neighbourhood when he told her to "look at these white hoes". She told the court he grabbed a wooden bat from the van, jumped out and was gone long enough for one song to play on the radio, while she stayed behind smoking marijuana. When Mr Viramontes returned, he allegedly said to Cruz that "the girls were really pretty" and that he did some "bogus" stuff. She said he had two handbags with him and told her to "drive off". The defendant grabbed the credit cards and told Cruz to take what she wanted, the court heard. She said she took some perfume. The court later heard that police first talked to Cruz two days after the attack on the two young women, after someone in her apartment block used Ms Jurich's mobile phone. Following the brief conversation with police, Mr Viramontes told her to get rid of the phone. Under cross-examination, Cruz admitted giving different stories to the police at different times. She said she did not tell the truth when first questioned by police following her 26 April arrest. Multiple tests carried out on swabs revealed no blood in the van allegedly used by Heriberto Viramontes, the court heard. There was no blood on the bat found in the van, according to a forensic biologist with the Illinois State Police crime lab. DNA samples were taken from Ms McShane, Ms Jurich, Mr Viramontes and Cruz for comparison with swabs taken from the baseball bat. They knew there was DNA from three people in the sample but could not carry out separate tests as they were all mixed in together. While DNA from the three women was not found, the results for Mr Viramontes were inconclusive. It could not be ruled out, the court was told. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, who is now 27, is unable to speak and struggles to walk or do simple tasks as a result of the injuries she sustained in the beating. She had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. Mr Viramontes is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges, from misuse of a credit card to aggravated battery. </body>

      <body>The construction industry in Northern Ireland has "exited recession". A rise in workloads has been reported for the first time in over five years. However, a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey said the region still lags behind the rest of the UK in terms of recovery. A spokesman said: "It is encouraging to see the workload balance turn positive following a long period in which the construction market has experienced a very significant downturn." The industry estimates it has lost at least 26,000 jobs in NI since the 2008 downturn - about 30% of its workforce. But the RICS sounded a note of caution amid "positivity" in the sector. "We are talking about small improvements from a low base and key challenges remain," said spokesman Jim Sammon. "Finance is tight, private sector activity remains scarce, and public sector demand remains constrained. We urge the NI Executive to encourage and nurture a recovery by increasing infrastructure spending," he said. There has been some relief in this respect. Money initially allocated to the stalled A5 upgrade between Londonderry and Aughnacloy has been redistributed to other road projects at Ballymena and Magherafelt, among others. Patsy McGlone, the chair of the Stormont All Party Group on Construction, welcomed the news, but said he remained cautious. "This announcement indicates a move in the right direction for the construction industry, which has suffered greatly during the economic downturn," he said. "The scrapping of such high profile projects, such as the Maze (peace centre), has been bad news for potential construction jobs in the North. "Action needs to be taken by the executive, to ensure that all viable construction projects are completed in order to achieve the maximum number of jobs in the industry." </body>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <body>French travellers blocking health workers from parking at a hospital say they will stay another day despite a request to leave the staff car park. NHS officials have written to the travellers asking them to move the 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The hospital has been seeking legal advice to try and move the vehicles. The travellers arrived late Saturday afternoon and moved on to the 300-space car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." </body>

      <body>Mozambique's opposition Renamo movement has attacked a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord with the government, officials say. Police are said to have fled their posts after gunmen opened fire and there are no reports of casualties. A Renamo spokesman said party leader Afonso Dhlakama had "lost control of the situation". On Monday, the army captured Mr Dhlakama's base, forcing him to flee. About a million people were killed in Mozambique's civil war. The conflict ended in 1992 when Renamo and the Frelimo government signed a peace accord. After the seizure of Mr Dhlakama's Sathunjira base on Monday, Renamo said it had pulled out of the peace deal. However, its 51 MPs have not withdrawn from parliament. The clashes have raised fears among many Mozambicans that the civil war could resume, threatening stability and the economic boom the southern Africa state is currently experiencing, correspondents say. State-run Radio Mozambique quoted a police source as saying that Renamo fighters attacked the police station in Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from Mr Dhlakama's former base in central Sofala province. The attack was intense, but there were no casualties, Radio Mozambique reported. A teacher in Meringue, Romao Martins, told AFP news agency that residents had fled their homes during the assault. Schools have also shut amid fears that the violence could escalate, AFP reports. "The situation is horrible here. Early this morning, armed men supposed to be Renamo, attacked and it was a mess," Mr Martins is quoted as saying. "For one hour, shooting could be heard from all directions and people fled from their homes." On Monday, defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of Mr Dhlakama's base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters. He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base with heavy weapons before occupying it. "Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances," Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency. The government has repeatedly accused Renamo of trying to drag the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post. A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force. Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his war-time camp in the Gorongosa mountains in centre of the country. After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Frelimo has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975. Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe. </body>

      <title>Kenya CCTV 'shows soldiers looting'</title>
      <description>Security camera footage emerges which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's Westgate mall siege, in which some 67 people died.</description>

      <body>Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall. In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. </body>

      <title>Rights groups condemn US drone raids</title>
      <description>CIA drone attacks in Pakistan and Yemen are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes, human rights groups say.</description>

      <body>CIA drone attacks in Pakistan are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes, Amnesty International says. Amnesty said it reviewed nine recent drone strikes in North Waziristan and found a number of victims were unarmed. In a separate report looking at six US attacks in Yemen, Human Rights Watch says two of them killed civilians at random, violating international law. Drone warfare has become common in the US pursuit of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Few details are known about the covert US drone operation. Senior al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed in drone strikes in Pakistan, but civilians have also died. These attacks cause outrage in Pakistan, where many assert that the strikes cause indiscriminate deaths and injuries. Last week, a UN investigation found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. UN special rapporteur Ben Emmerson accused the US of challenging international legal norms by advocating the use of lethal force outside war zones. Establishing precise casualty figures and identifying the dead in such attacks is virtually impossible as independent media are barred from tribal areas near the Afghan border. Amnesty said it had investigated nine of 45 recently reported attacks by US drones, unmanned aircraft operated remotely in control rooms, often on other continents. The group called on the US to disclose information and the legal basis for strikes carried out in Pakistan. In the report, Will I Be Next? US Drone Strikes in Pakistan, the rights group named several victims who, it says, had been unarmed and "posed no threat to life". In October 2012, 68-year-old grandmother Mamana Bibi was killed in a double strike as she picked vegetables in the family's fields while surrounded by her grandchildren, said the report. It said US President Barack Obama's pledge earlier this year to increase transparency around drone strikes had not been fulfilled. "This secrecy has enabled the USA to act with impunity and block victims from receiving justice or compensation. As far as Amnesty is aware, no US official has ever been held to account for unlawful killings by drones in Pakistan," the report said. It called on the governments of Pakistan, Australia, Germany and the UK to investigate drone strikes or other abuses that may constitute human rights violations. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch said in its report that six US drone attacks in Yemen killed 82 people, including at least 57 civilians. It added that two of the strikes killed innocent people indiscriminately. A controversial aspect of the US policy is that drone attacks are carried out not by the military but by the Central Intelligence Agency. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has argued in favour of the policy, saying that the US will continue to defend itself. President Obama has insisted the strategy was "kept on a very tight leash" and that without the drones, the US would have had to resort to "more intrusive military action". </body>

      <title>Australia merges bushfire blazes</title>
      <description>Fire fighters in Australia deliberately join two large fires near the Blue Mountains as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in Australia have deliberately joined up two large fires as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales. The fires near the Blue Mountains had been "tactically joined" to stop them merging with a third, officials say. Teams are engaged in extensive back-burning operations across the state ahead of worsening conditions expected on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning more than 60 blazes were still alight, with 13 uncontained. The region experienced light rain but firefighters say this will not be enough to quench the fires. New South Wales declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid some of the region's worst fires in years. On Monday fire officials feared that three blazes in the Blue Mountains area near Lithgow - at State Mine, Mount Victoria and Springwood - could link up, creating a massive fire. But NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that joining two of the fires had prevented them linking up with the third. "We are seeing positive results of these very deliberate, very targeted, very decisive strategies being deployed particularly in relation to back-burning operations... particularly in light of [Wednesday's] weather conditions," he said. Back-burning is controlled burning of key areas aimed at depriving a fire of fuel and prevent it travelling in a certain direction. The fire at State Mine has been downgraded to "watch and act" - from "emergency" - after some light rain at the fire zone. However, Mr Fitzsimmons added that "there's still a way to go" and that firefighters would be braced for higher temperatures and stronger winds expected on Wednesday. "We have got now probably 24 hours before we see the worst of the weather starting to develop and build across all these fire ground areas," he said. The conditions on Wednesday would be "about as bad as it gets". NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell told the BBC: "Tomorrow Wednesday in Sydney is expected to be the critical day when weather conditions return to what they were like last Thursday when these fires first started." "Whilst we've lost more than 200 properties [and] another 100 or so damaged, many thousands have been saved by the efforts of our volunteer and other fire fighters who've done a tremendous job for almost a week." Many families have their bags packed and are watching anxiously in case they are forced to flee, the BBC's Jon Donnison in the Blue Mountains reports. In parts of Sydney that has been shrouded in a smoky haze for much of the week air quality levels are reported to have been up to 50 times worse than normal, our correspondent adds. All schools in the Blue Mountains will be closed on Wednesday. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, was also arrested over the fires, reports said. Amid debate over the causes of the fires in Australia, United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres told US broadcaster CNN bushfires were "absolutely" linked to global warming, hitting out at Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to repeal the carbon tax. "We are really already paying the price of carbon," she said. "We are paying the price with wildfires, we are paying the price with droughts." Mr Abbott has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, introduced under the previous Labor government, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <title>Spain orders Eta convict's release</title>
      <description>Spain's high court sets a convicted Basque militant free, after a European court ruled prison work should have contributed to her early release.</description>

      <body>Spanish judges have ordered the release of a convicted Basque militant, after the European Court of Human Rights ruled against her continued detention. Ines del Rio, of the separatist group Eta, has been serving a 30-year sentence for bomb attacks in the 1980s. The High Court backed the ruling of a Strasbourg court on Monday against Spanish laws that denied her right to earn remission through prison work. Spain says dozens of Eta prisoners could now be eligible for release. Monday's Strasbourg ruling "gives us no choice", concluded a prosecutors' report at the High Court requesting Del Rio's immediate release, reported El Pais newspaper. The penal chamber subsequently ordered her immediate release. Del Rio is expected to be freed from a prison in A Coruna, north-western Spain, later on Tuesday. Groups representing victims of Eta's bloody four-decade campaign for independence for regions of northern Spain and south-west France denounced the Strasbourg ruling in protests on Monday, while supporters of the prisoners held marches in favour. Eta declared an end to its armed campaign in 2011. Del Rio was arrested in 1987 for her part in 23 murders and car bombings carried out by Eta. She was later sentenced to more than 3,800 years in jail, but the criminal code in force at the time reduced this to a maximum stay of 30 years. Del Rio earned sentence reductions through prison work, making her eligible for release in July 2008 - but two years earlier the High Court applied what is known as the "Parot doctrine" to extend her detention. Under this doctrine, sentence reductions are applied to the sentences for individual crimes - collectively amounting to 3,828 years - rather than the overall 30-year maximum stay. It meant Del Rio's release would be postponed until 2017. But on Monday the European Court of Human Rights, upholding a July 2012 ruling in favour of Del Rio, condemned Spain for this practice and ordered Spain to ensure her immediate release and to pay her 30,000 euros (Â£25,400; $41,000) in compensation. Although the Strasbourg court's ruling only applies to Del Rio, the Spanish government says dozens of other convicted Eta members could be eligible for release. </body>

      <title>Turkey EU accession talks to restart</title>
      <description>The EU agrees to restart Turkey membership talks, four months after they were postponed when EU members criticised a crackdown on protests.</description>

      <body>The European Union says it has agreed to resume membership talks with Turkey. The EU's European affairs ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, said the talks would restart on 5 November, after being stalled for three years. The EU had first agreed to relaunch negotiations in June, but postponed the talks after members criticised Turkey's crackdown on anti-government protests. Turkey first applied for full membership of what was then the European Economic Community in 1987. The ministers of the 28 EU members based their latest decision on a recommendation by the European Commission. In its 2013 progress report on Turkey published last week, the Commission had criticised as excessive the use of force by Turkish police in dealing with widespread demonstrations. But it recognised that Turkey had introduced judicial reforms. It also praised the announcement last month by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of a series of political reforms, including increased rights for Kurds. Linas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, which currently holds the EU presidency, congratulated Turkey on the resumption of the negotiating process, which he said was overdue. "Time to catch up!" he tweeted on Lithuania's official EU presidency site. Turkey has been an associate member of the European Union (then the European Economic Community) since 1963. Turkey met the last condition for accession talks in 2005, but negotiations have stalled over a range of issues, including concern over freedom of speech and democracy, treatment of religious minorities, judicial reform, and ongoing tensions with Cyprus, an EU member. During that time Ankara has watched other countries overtake Turkey in the queue for membership. Croatia became a full member of the EU in July, while Serbia achieved official candidate status earlier this year. </body>

      <title>Lone bid wins Brazil oilfield rights</title>
      <description>Rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield are auctioned to the sole bidder - a Brazilian-led consortium - amid angry clashes in Rio.</description>

      <body>The rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield have been won at an auction by a consortium led by Brazil's state-run Petrobras, backed by Total, Shell and Chinese firms. The group made the only bid in the auction, offering the minimum share of the surplus production. The Rio de Janeiro beachfront hotel, where the auction took place, was guarded by 1,100 security personnel. Earlier, striking oil workers opposed to the contest clashed with police. Eleven companies had expressed interest in the Libra oilfield, but the Spanish Repsol pulled out on Monday, leaving the five winners as the only ones to present a bid. Chinese state companies CNPC and CNOOC offered 10% each, while the French oil giant Total and the Anglo-Dutch Shell held another 20% stake each. Despite the lack of other offers, Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters he was "not one bit frustrated" by the contest having been won by the lowest possible bid. The president of the government's National Petroleum Agency, Magda Chambriard, called the auction an "absolute success". "It is hard to imagine a more successful outcome. These companies are among the world's 10 most valuable in the energy branch," she said. Petrobras offered a 10% stake on top of the 30% it was already entitled to according to the auctioning rules. The consortium secured the rights to explore the Libra's estimated 8-12 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves for 35 years. Heavy security has been in place around the hotel in the western Rio district Barra da Tijuca since Sunday. But violence broke out on Monday morning, as protesters tried to invade the cordoned area close to the hotel. Security officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper bombs at protesters who threw stones and used corrugated iron sheets as shields. The clashes were watched by a crowd spending the public holiday on Barra da Tijuca beach. "There were bizarre scenes. Riot police firing tear gas and stun grenades, not just against protesters, but also on to the beach, with hundreds of tourists and sun worshippers looking on incredulously," the BBC's Wyre Davies reports from Rio de Janeiro. Several protesters were injured. President Dilma Rousseff had ordered tight security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Among the protesters are members of various unions representing oil workers, who have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. The unions accuse the government of "selling off" Brazil's riches. Others argued that the rules set by the government for the auction allowed too much state intervention, scaring off big players such as BP and Exxon. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010. The offshore oilfield is located at a depth of some 5,000m (16,500ft), below a thick layer of rock, sand and salt, which makes its exploration extremely challenging. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. </body>

      <description>Venezuelan divers recover the remains of five bodies from a crashed plane believed to have been carrying Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni.</description>

      <body>Divers searching for Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni have taken samples from five bodies they found in the wreckage of a plane in the Caribbean, Venezuelan officials say. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega said it could take up to a month to identify the remains. But she said that the luggage found in the plane indicated they were those of Mr Missoni, his wife and friends. The group disappeared on 4 January on a flight from Los Roques islands. Mr Missoni, 58, his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, and their Italian friends Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi had been on holiday on Los Roques. They were flying back to Caracas when the plane flown by Venezuelan pilots Hernan Merchan and Jose Ferrer lost touch with the control tower some 10 nautical miles off Los Roques. The last radar report showed the aircraft accelerating at a height of 1,650m (5,400ft) before it rapidly lost altitude and speed, veering to the right until it disappeared from the radar. Following the plane's disappearance, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. The plane's wreckage was spotted in June at a depth of 75m (250ft), but Venezuelan navy divers were only able to reach it over the past 10 days. The divers said they also located a sixth body, but were not able to extract any samples from it because it was too difficult to access. Ms Ortega said that the DNA tests "could take 48 hours, but also up to a month, depending on the quality of the samples". Mr Missoni was the son of the fashion brand's founder, Ottavio Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian militant has been shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank, the Israeli army has said. Mohammad Assi, a member of Islamic Jihad, was killed during a gunfight near the village of Bilin, army spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said. Assi reportedly exchanged fire for several hours with the soldiers from a cave after escaping an arrest raid. He was suspected of planning a bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv on 21 November 2012 that injured 29 people. The attack happened at the end of an eight-day conflict between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. "Mohammed Assi was hiding out in various places over the last year trying to avoid detection. This morning his running came to an abrupt end," Col Lerner wrote on Twitter. Israel Radio reported that two associates were arrested in the initial Israeli operation in Bilin in the early hours of Tuesday morning, but that Assi escaped and sought refuge in a nearby cage. The troops surrounded the cave for a number of hours, during which there were exchanges of fire. At one point, a rocket-propelled grenade was launched at the troops, according to Israel Radio. Assi was eventually shot after refusing calls to surrender, it added. Islamic Jihad said he had been one of its members, and that he was "assassinated by the occupation in Kufr Nemeh", a village near Bilin. Two months ago, three Palestinians were shot dead in clashes that erupted when Israeli troops tried to detain a suspect in the Qalandiya refugee camp. </body>

      <body>A court in Qatar has upheld a 15-year prison sentence given to a poet found guilty of inciting people to overthrow the government and insulting the emir. Mohammed al-Ajami's lawyer, Najib al-Nuami, said the Court of Cassation's ruling had been "political". His only remaining option was to appeal to the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for clemency, Mr Nuami added. Mr Ajami was originally jailed for life last year but the sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal in February. Human rights group have criticised his conviction as a betrayal of free speech. They said his original trial was marred by irregularities, with court sessions held in secret. The case against Mr Ajami was said to have been based on a poem he wrote in 2010 which criticised the former emir, Sheikh Hamad Al Thani. But activists believe the authorities were punishing him for a 2011 poem he wrote about authoritarian rule in the region. In the poem Tunisian Jasmine, a private recitation of which was uploaded to the internet in January 2011, Mr Ajami expressed his support for the uprising in the North African state, saying: "We are all Tunisia in the face of the repressive elite." He also denounced "all Arab governments" as "indiscriminate thieves". The father of four, also known as Mohammed Ibn al-Dheeb, has said the poems were not meant to be offensive or seditious. Mr Nuami, a former justice minister, argued at the Court of Cassation that the maximum sentence Mr Ajami should have received was five years. He described Monday's ruling as "a political and not a judicial decision". "I hope the emir will grant him an amnesty," he told the AFP news agency. </body>

      <title>Obama addresses healthcare glitches</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24613022</url>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (Â£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <body>A student at a Nevada middle school shot dead a teacher hailed as a hero for trying to convince the boy to drop his gun, authorities have said. Michael Landsberry, a 45-year-old Afghanistan veteran, was "defending the students", a local official said. The student wounded two other students before turning the gun on himself, police said. Sparks Middle School and a nearby primary school was evacuated and classes cancelled. The incident occurred at 07:15 local time (14:15 GMT) shortly before the scheduled start of classes. As many as 200 police officers responded to the scene but fired no shots, authorities said. Student Michelle Hernandez told the Reno Gazette-Journal she had seen the suspect before the shooting began. "I heard him saying, 'Why you people making fun of me? Why you laughing at me?'" she told the paper. Maths teacher Mr Landsberry, who had served two tours in Afghanistan with the Nevada National Guard, leaves behind a wife and two stepdaughters. "In my estimation, he is a hero," said Reno Deputy Police Chief Tom Robinson. "We do know he was trying to intervene." Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said Mr Landsberry "proudly served his country and was proudly defending the students at his school". The two 12-year-old wounded students were said to be in a stable condition in hospital. At a news conference, police said one student was out of surgery and the other was doing well. At an evacuation pick-up point, parents were reunited with children, some of whom were in tears, the Associated Press reported. "We came flying down here to get our kids," said Mike Fiorica, whose nephew attends the school. "It's really chaotic. You can imagine how parents are feeling. You don't know if your kid's okay." The local education authority held a session earlier this year on safety measures in its schools after 26 people, including 20 children, were killed at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. The attack briefly revived calls for gun control. But in a country where fatal shootings are an everyday occurrence, even that massacre did not lead to nationwide reforms. Elsewhere in Nevada on Monday, a man opened fire in a Las Vegas nightclub after being denied a refund for an entry fee, killing a patron who tried to intervene, police said. According to media reports, the suspect demanded his money back after he found Drai's After Hours, a club at Bally's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, too small. The club's manager and a security guard were also shot and taken to hospital, police Sgt John Sheahan said. The suspect was transported to hospital with unspecified injuries. Authorities believe he acted alone and expect to charge him with murder and attempted murder. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs."

      <body>Thousands of clandestine migrants have reached Europe in recent months, with increasing numbers arriving from war-torn Syria. The BBC's Matthew Price has been following the progress of one Syrian family since it arrived on the island of Lampedusa in Italy. The little dark-haired boy is sitting bolt upright on a bench in a cafe just across the road from Vienna's Meidling railway station. His puffer jacket is zipped right up to his neck. He is fast asleep. His younger sister is also trying to sleep, face down with her head on her arms on a table by the window. Their mother lights another cigarette, and draws on it nervously. Theirs has been the longest journey - and it is not over yet. Their train pulled in from Bologna, Italy, a few hours ago. The family huddled together in a carriage, as they had been all night - not knowing what to expect when they arrived, not knowing whether they would arrive. In Italy, "they gave us a choice - to stay or leave," says the mother, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals for her relatives left behind in their native Syria. We shall call her Amal. But "there is no way we could find work in Italy," she adds. The economic situation there is just too tough. Like many migrants, they wanted to head north, to central and northern Europe. Tears begin to wet her eyes. "I want a better life and stability for my children, I want them to go to school and live just like other kids. "My children ask me: 'Where is our house mum?' My daughter asks me about her bed, she wants to sleep in her bed, and I don't know what to say to her." The tears run down her cheeks. In the corner, her husband also starts to cry. Their journey together had started many years earlier. Amal married her husband, an architect, almost two decades ago. Their first child was born a few years later. Amal is a Muslim, her husband a Christian. From the start, they say they were persecuted because of their mixed marriage. So in 2000, they decided to move to Libya. They lived there for 11 years, until the revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi started, and the country grew more and more unstable. So they returned to Syria, where they still owned two properties. "I was arrested when we landed at the airport," says Amal. It was - she says - a post on a social media site, quoting an Arabic poet that drew her to the authorities' attention. Amal received a three-year prison sentence as punishment for "endangering the country's security and humiliating the government", she says. Her husband sold their properties, and managed to bribe the judges on the case with $100,000 (Â£62,000). They reduced the sentence to eight months. As soon as she was released, the family was on the move again, helped by the rest of the money from the sale of their houses. They flew to Egypt, and there contacted smugglers who got them back into Libya. They hoped to stay, but after a few months they realised the country was too unstable, and they asked the smugglers to take them to Europe. "There were 200 people in the smugglers' house [in Libya]". "We stayed there for eight days." Then they boarded the boat for Europe. "It was like a death trip, a suicide trip." The children "were so scared and I regretted it. The boat was so bad. We were told the boat was big and that the trip would be comfortable. There was no way we could change our minds." They arrived in Lampedusa "thanks to God", says Amal. There they were housed in the island's small refugee centre, overflowing with new arrivals. Then, after a few days, when space became available at another centre in Foggia, southern Italy, they were transferred by plane by the Italian interior ministry. In Foggia, "we were told: 'You have three days to apply for asylum here or leave'." So they left, Amal said. "The Red Cross drove us to the train station. Someone from the refugee camp helped us book the tickets. We took the train to Bologna. Then another to Vienna." Under European Union law, migrants should be processed in the country in which they first arrive. That is where any asylum claim should be considered. According to Amal though, people in some parts of the Italian system allowed them to leave, and indeed actively encouraged them to go. The Austrian authorities are sending back many Syrians arriving through the Brenner Pass from Italy without the correct documents. It is similar to what so angered the French government back in 2011, when Tunisian and Libyan migrants were being granted temporary permits that allowed them to skip across the border using the train from Ventimiglia in north-west Italy to Nice in France. Italian officials say that without more help from the EU they cannot cope with the number of migrants reaching their shores at the moment. It is clear they are also trying to alleviate the pressure, by turning a blind eye to the rules that govern migration into the bloc. "It's a grey area," an EU official says. "It may not actually break the law, but it's not within the spirit of it." Before all this, Amal says, "our life was stable." "We had everything. My husband's job was very good. We lacked nothing. We could provide anything my children wanted." And now? "This is injustice. I don't blame the European countries," says Amal. "I blame the Arab countries who refuse to accept us." It is the Arab countries "who forced us to leave", she continues. If they took in Syrian refugees, families like hers would not have to "follow illegal ways to get here". The coffee and cigarettes finished, they head outside once again, with one suitcase between them, containing all that they own now. They take the tram out of the city, to the asylum centre. The little boy kicks up golden autumn leaves on the pavement. "It's very cold," says Amal. Her younger daughter pulls a towel tightly round her shoulders for warmth. "I want my children to smile again," Amal says. The wind whips up the leaves, scattering them. The sun is low in a hazy sky. That evening, less than two weeks after arriving in Europe, Amal and her family formally request asylum in Austria. </body>

      <description>Are people too snobbish about frozen food?</description>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was Â£2.50 and one was Â£1.50 you naturally assume the Â£2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at Â£20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Is there a humane way to rid your garden of foxes?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>
      <date>1382403985</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70633000/jpg/_70633978_garden2.bbc.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>
      <description>The rise and rise of the celebrity patissier</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24609525</url>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the classic vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaron (a light meringue biscuit), the tarte aux pommes (apple tart) or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaron with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macarons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-Ã -Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <body>To fans of motor racing the banked section of crumbling road in the above picture is instantly recognisable as the home of British motorsport, Brooklands. This was the site of the first purpose-built motor racing circuit anywhere in the world, and one that in its heyday in the 1920s and '30s saw thousands of fans lining the track, hoping to catch a glimpse of those pioneering racers. The course was built in 1907 with sections of concrete banking to allow the cars to reach higher speeds than would otherwise have been possible. The design ensured it was the site of a number of land speed records and was home to the first British Grand Prix in 1927. Alongside its motoring heritage it was also home to aviation pioneers, and by the start of World War II the site was given over to use by Vickers-Armstrongs and Hawker aircraft companies. Sadly, motor racing never returned to the site, though TV presenter James May did attempt to build the biggest Scalextric track along the route. Photographer Douglas Kurn lives locally and decided to undertake the task of documenting the remains of the Brooklands circuit. To contrast with the noise and speed of a race day, Douglas chose to shoot the project at night to give a peaceful, surreal feel to the images. Some of the exposures ran well past the hour and in total the project has taken four years to complete. The Spirit of Brooklands was chosen by the Association of Photographers for its online exhibition of members' work, and a selection of prints was recently exhibited at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge.

      <title>Drones kill rescuers in 'double tap', say activists</title>
      <description>Drones hit targets twice, killing rescuers, say activists</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24557333</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70578000/jpg/_70578087_170030679.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Drones are often lauded for their supposed precision and accuracy. Sometimes, though, the machines - and their human operators - make mistakes, as two new reports from human rights organisations show. The first round of missiles struck a tent in Zowi Sidgi, a village in North Waziristan, at dusk on 6 July 2012. A small group of miners and woodcutters had gathered there for dinner, according to Amnesty International's Mustafa Qadri. The tent burned. Friends and family members came running to help. A moment later, there was another drone strike. Many of the people who had come to assist their friends and relatives in the tent were also killed. Altogether 18 people died in the two rounds of drone strikes. One of the victims was a 14-year-old boy. The strikes in Zowi Sidgi fall into a special category of attacks, said Qadri, a lethal operation that includes two phases. For these attacks, the US relies on consecutive rounds of strikes - missiles are dropped, killing people. A moment later - when people in the area have raced to the scene to help the wounded, another round of missiles is dropped. This practice, known as a "double tap", as journalists have described, is being used more often. "They appear to be targeting those who have come in to help those who are injured," said Qadri. "And that's particularly shocking." His research appears in an Amnesty International report. In a May speech at Fort McNair in Washington, however, US President Barack Obama said the drone strikes in Pakistan and other countries are "effective" and "legal". "Before any strike is taken, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured - the highest standard we can set," he said. A Human Rights Watch study on drone strikes in Yemen has also been released. For the Human Rights Watch report, researchers looked at six strikes that took place in Yemen from 2009-13. Researchers claim that two of the attacks violated the laws of war "because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons". More than 640 people have been killed in US-directed drone strikes in Yemen over the past decade, according to New America Foundation. During this period of time, about 2,065 people were killed in strikes in Pakistan. Most of the people who have been killed in the strikes were militants, as research done byaccording to New America Foundation has shown. But sometimes the wrong individuals are targeted. Americans rely on information gathered by the CIA, the National Security Agency and other US agencies, as documents from former contractor Edward Snowden reveal, to plan some of the strikes. Individuals who are planning the strikes use the information in order to determine whether or not to carry out an assault - and who should be targeted. When contacted by the BBC, CIA officials declined to comment. In addition Americans may rely on so-called "pattern of life" analysis, which means they study a group of people over time in order to see if they are doing anything suspicious. The definition can be broad. Indeed Qadri and other activists believe the definition is so vague that innocent people are killed as a result. "If you're a military-aged male, you're considered a target," he said. For the Amnesty International report, researchers interviewed more than 60 people, including individuals who saw the strikes in Pakistan occur. Some of the interviews were done in North Waziristan. Based on this research, Qadri and others believe the drone strike in Zowi Sidgi was wrong. "Let's assume the US made a mistake in the first strike," he said. "But in the second round it should have been clear that they were killing civilians. A child was killed. "It's up to the US to tell us why they were targeted," he said. "In the absence of that, it's an unlawful killing." </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated art from death</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes. "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collectorâ¦ there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>UK QE has failed, says QE inventor</title>
      <description>Where did the phrase 'quantitative easing' come from?</description>

      <body>When the UK embarked on quantitative easing (QE) in March 2009, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Bank of England was expected to administer a monetary stimulus equal to Â£50bn, writes Liam Halligan. Over the past four years, such "extraordinary measures" have extended somewhat more, with the Bank's bond-buying programme now amounting to Â£375bn - almost eight times the original estimate. Since the financial crisis began, the Bank of England's balance sheet has expanded four-fold. But where did the phrase "quantitative easing" come from? Arguably among the most controversial economic policies of recent years, QE is surely the most unpronounceable. Not many Western analysts are aware that this tongue-challenging name originated in Japan, the modern-day spiritual home of money-printing. Even fewer know that the man who coined the phrase comes from Germany - which, of all the big Western economies, has probably the most deep-seated aversion to printing money. In the mid-1990s, Prof Richard Werner, a German academic fluent in Japanese, was working as an economist in Tokyo. Japan's real estate bubble had burst and property and share prices were tumbling. The country was locked in a debate about the use of unconventional monetary policy to support asset prices and boost broader commercial activity. Prof Werner submitted an article to Nikkei, a leading business newspaper, advocating a new type of radical monetary measure. Rather than attempting to shift interest rates, he argued that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan should instead intervene directly to influence the size of the money supply by taking steps to encourage commercial banks to extend more credit. "I was promoting a policy that involved more credit creation, rather than changing the price of money," says Prof Werner. "So when I wrote my article, and after the newspaper's editors insisted on a phrase readers would understand, I added the Japanese adjective for quantity to the standard expression for monetary stimulation. 'Quantitative easing' was the literal translation back into English of these two Japanese words." Prof Werner's article was widely noticed. Several years later, in fact, the Bank of Japan decided to implement extreme monetary measures and adopted the Japanese name the German economist had coined. "In 2001, the Japanese central bank said, 'Now we're actually doing this'," he recalls. "To communicate this to global markets, they had to give the policy a name in English. I suppose the translators had a bad day, or were under time pressure. Normally, you'd try to come up with something slightly more fluent than 'quantitative easing', but they did only a literal translation." While the Bank of Japan adopted the precise name of Prof Werner's policy, it was somewhat less accurate when interpreting his actual proposal. Incredibly, the Japanese version of QE that was eventually implemented was a policy Prof Werner had specifically ruled-out. Prof Werner's argument was that, because more than 95% of the money supply in a modern economy is derived not from cash or reserves, but from private bank lending, it is essential to get banks to lend. So he urged the Japanese government to enter into private long-term agreements to borrow from commercial banks, instead of issuing government debt. The Bank of Japan's version of QE, in contrast, involved creating money out of nothing at the central bank. "That's absolutely not what my policy was about," says Prof Werner. "In my original article, I specifically argued against either lowering interest rates or expanding central bank reserves. That was my whole point - traditional solutions weren't going to work. Actually, it was a bit upsetting." Then, in an additional twist, the Bank of England also later adopted Prof Werner's QE label - but, again, to describe a policy with which he didn't agree. "It was one thing when the Bank of Japan did it, because that was over in Japan and was some time ago," he says. "But once the Bank of England also started using the phrase, I thought 'Hang on - I've got to speak up and make clear that the original definition is quite different.'" The Bank of England's interpretation of QE also involves the creation of central bank credits, as in Japan. But in the UK these have been used to buy government bonds from commercial banks rather than from the government directly. Prof Werner says this is "a little better" than Japanese QE, as it "at least in theory increases commercial banks' reserves". He maintains, though, that the "best way to boost the economy is to increase bank credit", and that can only be guaranteed by governments borrowing from banks directly. "That creates new credit," says Prof Werner. "The money supply then expands, transactions increase, there's more demand, more employment, more tax revenues and suddenly you have a virtuous circle." In both Japan and the UK, QE isn't working, he says, because it doesn't focus on "the most important part of the money supply", which is bank lending. "UK QE has singularly failed, as bank credit is still shrinking." When faced with the claim used by some British banks that the demand for credit is low, Prof Werner is dismissive. "I'm quite used to this argument, because banks in Japan used it for 20 years," he says. "The banks, of course, have become very risk-averse, as they have many non-performing assets." Prof Werner is also critical of the UK's concentrated banking structure - which he argues has made the economy more vulnerable. "British banking is dominated by a small number of big banks - with just five banks controlling 90% of deposits," he says. "Big banks want to lend to big firms and do big deals that give big bonuses. Small firms are too much hassle, and the banks are absolutely not interested - even though small firms need the credit and account for 70% of UK employment. So these small firms are credit-rationed and that's a problem." "In Germany, 70% of deposits are held by 2,000 banks," says Prof Werner. "These local German banks lend a lot more to small- and medium-sized firms, and when the credit crunch happened most of them were fine." When it comes to QE, although his policy recommendations have been misinterpreted in Japan, the UK and elsewhere, Prof Werner maintains his natural sense of humour about giving the world a phrase that's so challenging to say. "It's become a household name anyway and I should get some kind of fee, some royalties, for that," he says with a smile. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save Â£500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS Â£2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra Â£500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a Â£200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise Â£200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between Â£60m and Â£80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is Â£20m-Â£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further Â£50m-Â£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" Â£500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just Â£73m a year is recouped out of more than Â£460m at present. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the proposed new levy would apply to all non-EEA nationals - regardless of whether their country has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's Â£500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed Â£200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than Â£200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Child bone-marrow transplant 'first'</title>
      <description>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique for sick children.</description>

      <body>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique. They say the method should help with donor shortages since it does not require a perfect cell match. Mohammed Ahmed, who is nearly five years old, was among the first three children in the world to try out the new treatment. He has severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and had been waiting for a suitable donor for years. Mohammed, who lives in Milton Keynes, was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital when he was a year old. His condition - a weak immune system - makes him more susceptible to infections than most, and a bone marrow transplant is the only known treatment. While Mohammed was on the transplant waiting list, he became extremely sick with swine flu. At that time, his doctors decided Mohammed's only real hope was to have a mismatched bone-marrow transplant, with his father acting as the donor. Mohammed's dad, Jamil, agreed to give the experimental therapy a go. Before giving his donation, Jamil was first vaccinated against swine flu so that his own bone-marrow cells would know how to fight the infection. Mohammed's doctors then modified these donated immune cells, called "T-cells", in the lab to engineer a safety switch - a self-destruct message that could be activated if Mohammed's body should start to reject them once transplanted. Rejection or graft-v-host disease is a serious complication of bone-marrow transplants, particularly where tissue matching between donor and recipient is not perfect, and is one of the most difficult challenges faced by patients and their doctors. Mismatched transplants in children - where the donor is not a close match for the child - are usually depleted of T-cells to prevent graft-v-host disease, but this causes problems in terms of virus infections and leukaemia relapse. The safety switch gets round this - plenty of T-cells to be transfused and later killed off if problems do arise. Thankfully, the transplant carried out in 2011 was a success - Mohammed's doctors did not need to use the safety switch. Although Mohammed still has to take a number of medicines to ward off future infections, his immune system is now in better shape. Jamil said: "We waited for a full match but it did not come. By the grace of God, we took the decision to have the treatment. "Now he is all right. Sometimes we forget what he has been through. We are just so grateful." He said Mohammed would still need close monitoring and regular health checks over the coming years, but his outlook was good. Dr Waseem Qasim, âconsultant in paediatric immunology at Great Ormond Street Hospital and lead author for the study, said the new approach should hopefully mean children who received a mismatched transplant could enjoy the same chance of success as those given a fully matched transplant. "We think Mohammed is cured of his disorder. He should be able to lead a fairly normal life now." A full report about Mohammed's therapy and the research by Great Ormond Street Hospital, King's College London and the Institute of Child Health has just been published in PLoS One journal. There are currently about 1,600 people in the UK waiting for a bone-marrow transplant and 37,000 worldwide. Just 30% of people will find a matching donor from within their families. Donations involve collecting blood from a vein or aspirating bone marrow from the pelvis using a needle and syringe. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Mental health veterans therapy fear</title>
      <description>Armed forces veterans struggling with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder are being put at risk from a therapy used by a Welsh charity, a BBC investigation finds.</description>

      <body>Armed forces veterans struggling with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder are being put at risk from a therapy used by a Welsh charity, a BBC investigation has found. Healing the Wounds in Porthcawl has been asked to stop using Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). The therapy is not regulated or approved and can make patients worse. But Healing the Wounds said it is gathering data to prove its treatment is effective. Dr Neil Kitchiner, head of the NHS All Wales Veterans Health and Wellbeing service, told the BBC's Week In Week Out programme, which sent a Falklands veteran undercover to see what is being offered, that he has not seen evidence of the treatment working. "None of them are cured as far as I've seen, after three days treatment," he said. "Some have been made very unwell as a result of going there and have needed a lot of support from NHS and veterans' charities. "We have asked them to stop it. "We have shown the evidence from the NHS and from the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, we've shared our concerns with them and yet they continue to operate in the way they do." Healing The Wounds was set up by Bridgend couple Kevin and Carol Richards and has raised almost Â£500,000 in the last three years. They insist it is offering a safe and effective alternative therapy for veterans. But on the programme some describe feeling even worse after a three-day residential course during which veterans are sent to a hotel overnight. One veteran, who did not want to be identified, said the course of therapy left him feeling suicidal. "I did two full days and on the third I left and my wife came to collect me," he said. "When she came through the doors it was such a relief, I was left feeling worse than when I first went into Healing The Wounds." The undercover veteran, who does not have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but described suffering some of the symptoms, was told by Carol Richards during therapy that it had taken her just 20 minutes to help one soldier who had seen many of his colleagues killed. No attempt was made to contact the undercover veteran's GP to check his physical or mental health before therapy began. Prof Neil Greenberg, co-director of the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health at Kings College London, said: "If this group who are not medically qualified and don't know a person's whole treatment history, because they haven't got that, that could cause some real problems, it could be quite dangerous." Healing the Wounds said it is collecting data to prove its treatment is effective, but Prof Greenberg says unless NLP is subjected to what are known as randomised clinical trials it cannot be established as an appropriate treatment for PTSD. He added: "NLP has not been investigated by proper scientific trials to show it works. "The key point is, just because someone feels good at end session, there is no guarantee they're going to feel good in the future. "And given the fact we know psychological therapies have potential to harm we need to do those trails." The programme also discovered that regulators have investigated the qualifications of a counsellor who had falsely been described as a clinical psychologist and a paramedic while helping vulnerable veterans for the charity. John Yandle from Blaenavon claims Healing The Wounds did not check his qualifications before he began counselling people with PTSD who had turned to it for help. The Health and Care Professions Council which polices the appropriate use of job titles including paramedic and clinical psychologist has ordered him not to use the titles in future. Mr Yandle, who does have counselling qualifications, denied deliberately misleading people and says the charity had mistakenly referred to him as a paramedic on its website. Darren Millar, chair of the Welsh assembly's cross-party group on the Armed Forces, is calling for better regulation of charities offering mental health services to veterans. He said: "Because there is no regulation anybody can set up as an NLP practitioner and the quality of their work is not monitored by anybody so that puts potential risks out in the field for anybody accessing those sorts of services." "What we need is some proper arrangements for oversight of the quality of the work being done by any charity that is giving some support to veterans. "What is important is to measure the outcomes when any organisation is offering this sort of service to see if it is making a real difference in the lives of the people who contact it." The Charities Commission has confirmed it is investigating Healing the Wounds and its links to The Forces Aid Foundation - set up by Kevin Richards and wrongly described as a charity on its website. Mr Richards thanked the programme for pointing out the error and said it would amend its website. The Welsh government said it has spent Â£500,000 on the All Wales Veterans Health and Well Being Service. A spokesman added: "We are clear that where any body offers treatment for any condition, they should ensure that these are in line with evidence based guidelines. "This is a stipulation for the NHS but an expectation for general good practice more broadly." Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales on Tuesday, 22 October 2013 at 22:35 BST </body>

Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <description>Health chiefs plan to halt some non-urgent surgery at four general hospitals in mid and west Wales to cope with winter pressures.</description>

      <body>Health chiefs plan to halt some non-urgent surgery at four major hospitals in mid and west Wales over the winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said it would not carry out some elective orthopaedic operations like hip and knee replacements while it dealt with increased pressure on services. Hospitals in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth are affected. The health service union Unison criticised the move saying it would result in longer delays for patients. The health board said if the plans were backed it would review its proposals at the West Wales General, Withybush, Prince Philip, Llanelli and Bronglais, Aberystwyth hospitals "towards the end of the winter surge". But Unison claims the board is cancelling all non-urgent orthopaedic surgery until April 2014. Dr Phil Kloer, director of clinical services at Hywel Dda, told BBC Wales that emergency cases and people already booked for elective orthopaedic surgery would not be affected, but the four hospitals would take no new elective surgeries from November. Earlier, he said: "In past years, there have been too many operations cancelled at the last minute due to emergency admissions. "In previous winters, we had up to 160 additional beds in place often being managed by temporary staff. This is not a position we can sustain this year." "To address this, we propose to manage our bed stock and elective surgical lists in a better way during the busiest months this winter to ensure we have the staff capacity to manage emergencies and the most urgent patients. "We would like to reassure patients that if they have an urgent clinical need they will be seen. Emergency and cancer procedures, the vast majority of orthopaedic day surgery and other elective procedures will also continue." The health board said people on a waiting list for surgery who had not been given a date for their operation might be offered another form of treatment or day surgery, depending on how urgent their situation was. Unison branch chairwoman Wendy Evans said: "The health board already has a waiting time of 15 months for patients awaiting orthopaedic surgery. "This will clearly add at least another five to six months to their waiting time, causing further distress and possibly further complications to their condition." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have been reassured by Hywel Dda Health Board that, at this stage, it is simply exploring options to ensure it is best placed to respond to demands on emergency care services this winter. "One option involves proposals to re-schedule some planned orthopaedic surgery, so it has the capacity minimise the distress caused by last-minute cancellations. We are assured that all urgent, cancer and day surgery would continue. "The health board will give careful consideration to this proposed option and discuss it widely with staff and stakeholders before any final decision is taken." However, the Welsh Conservatives' health spokesman Darren Millar said the decision had been forced upon the health board by "Labour's inability to recruit permanent staff and properly invest in the health service". He added: "Carwyn Jones's legacy of health budget cuts continues to heap untold pressures on frontline staff and - yet again - it is patients who will suffer. "There should be absolutely no suggestion of cancelled operations. "The health board should work with the independent sector to ensure that patients can access the treatment they need." William Powell, Lib Dem AM for mid and west Wales, said he had asked for the Health Minister Mark Drakeford to answer an urgent question about the issue in the Senedd on Tuesday. Last week Hywel Dda said it was postponing some operations at Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth for up to a month because of staff shortages. The board said it was also cutting six beds on a general surgery ward because of the shortages. Plaid Cymru's Ceredigion AM Elin Jones claimed the management of the health service in west Wales was approaching meltdown. She added: "The sudden cancellation of all elective orthopaedic surgery outside Carmarthen, on top of the bed closures last week at Bronglais and persistent rumours of the run-down of services elsewhere, is undermining the confidence of people in Ceredigion and across west Wales." Last January non-emergency operations were cancelled in north and south Wales due to a seasonal rise in winter illnesses putting pressure on NHS hospitals. </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <title>Obama addresses healthcare glitches</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (Â£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of NHS workers have been blocked from parking at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after French travellers set up camp in the staff car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away after 14 caravans moved onto the 300-space area. Hospital spokesman Julian Hayman said they were seeking legal advice in order to move the travellers on. He added that hospital services had not been disrupted as a result. But one hospital worker, who did not want to be named, said it was "infuriating". "Finding a parking space is bad enough normally without this happening first thing," the worker said. "I find it infuriating this situation can be allowed to continue until the families decide to move themselves on. "There are doctors and other medical staff who work on emergency cases around the clock. "They are being forced to park some distance away all because a group of French travellers fancied the spot to set up camp." Terry Jones, 64, who was visiting a relative in hospital, said: "Someone could suffer because a doctor is late for their shift. "It just shouldn't be allowed to happen. "It may not be politically correct to say it but these people never seem to think about the impact it will have on the rest of us. "I hope they realise what a nuisance they are causing to the staff and move on soon." Mr Hayman said the travellers had taken approximately 65 spaces. "We will ensure that security is available on site from 6am-10pm every day to reassure and support staff," he said. "We are taking legal advice to resolve the situation as soon as possible - there is no quick legal solution but we are also working with the travellers to ensure they leave as soon as possible. "There has been no disruption to hospital services and, in the main, staff have been very understanding and acted in a professional manner throughout the morning." Another hospital spokesman, Jamie Marchant, told the BBC that they believed the travellers were visiting Newport for a family funeral and planned to leave in "a few days". </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental ill health. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 200 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naÃ¯ve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551945</url>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around Â£100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged.

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (Â£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Where deadly hyenas are used to treat mental illness</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay Â£350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Millions of people around the world have learned CPR on a mannequin known as Resusci Anne. The story of the 19th Century beauty behind the model - or at least, one version of it - will be told at a symposium in London to mark European Restart a Heart Day. But does anyone really know anything about her? The Lorenzi workshop is a small haven of peace and antiquity in the busy Parisian suburb of Arcueil. And it's the last of its kind. Downstairs the mouleurs, or cast-makers, create figurines, busts and statues, pouring plaster into moulds in much the same way they have since the family business started in the 1870s. But if you want to be face-to-face with history, pick your way up the dusty wooden stairs to a room above the workshop. It's an unsettling experience. Hanging all around you in the narrow attic are life and death masks of poets and artists, politicians and revolutionaries: Napoleon, Robespierre, Verlaine, Victor Hugo, the robust, impatient face of the living Beethoven and the sallow, diminished features of the composer's death mask. Yet, surprisingly, of all the visages of the great and the good on display at Lorenzi's, the best-seller is the mask of a young woman. She has a pleasant, attractive face, with the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Her eyes are closed but they look as if they might spring open at any moment. Hers is the one mask that has no name. She's known simply as the Inconnue, the unknown woman of the Seine. This is how her story goes. Some time in the late 19th Century, the drowned body of a young woman was recovered from the River Seine. As was customary in those days, her body was put on display at the Paris mortuary, in the hope that someone would recognise and identify her. The pathologist on duty became so entranced by the face of the girl with the enigmatic half-smile that he asked a moulder to take a plaster cast of her face. Before long the mask began to appear for sale outside the mouleurs' workshops on the Left Bank and soon the young woman's face became a muse for artists, novelists and poets, all eager to weave imagined identities and stories around the mystery woman, this drowned Mona Lisa. Over the years Rilke, Louis Aragon, Man Ray and Vladimir Nabokov successively fell under the Inconnue's spell and at one time no fashionable European drawing room was complete without a mask of the Inconnue on the wall. One of the first stories featuring her was the 1899 novella The Worshipper of the Image by Richard le Gallienne, who portrays the mask as a malevolent force which bewitches and ultimately destroys a young poet. Other authors have been kinder, many of them telling the story of an innocent young woman from the country who comes to Paris, who's seduced by a rich lover and then abandoned when she falls pregnant. With nobody to turn to, she drowns herself in the waters of the Seine, a modern Ophelia. At the mortuary, her beautiful face, now peaceful in death, is preserved forever with a plaster cast. It was another drowning - or near-drowning - that ensured the Inconnue a place in medical history. In 1955 Asmund Laerdal saved the life of his young son, Tore, grabbing the boy's lifeless body from the water just in time and clearing his airways. Laerdal at that time was a successful Norwegian toy manufacturer, specialising in making children's dolls and model cars from the new generation of soft plastics. When he was approached to make a training aid for the newly-invented technique of CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the combination of chest compressions and the kiss of life which can save the life of a patient whose heart has stopped - his son's brush with death a few years earlier made him very receptive. He developed a torso or whole-body mannequin which simulates an unconscious patient requiring CPR. Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents' house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you're one of the 300 million people who's been trained in CPR, you've almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue's. Through Resusci Anne, students of first aid have for more than 50 years been trying to bring back to life the young woman from the Seine. But was the Inconnue actually dead in the first place? Is that peaceful face really a death mask or was it taken from a live model? When a few years ago I was making a Radio 4 programme about the Inconnue with the novelist Louise Welsh, we decided to show the mask to the men and women who specialise in recovering drowned bodies from the Seine - the Paris river police, known as the Brigade Fluviale. Sitting in the wheelhouse of one of the brigade's boats moored at their headquarters near the Pont d'Austerlitz, Chief Brigadier Pascal Jacquin was less than convinced that the girl was dead when the mask was made. "It's surprising to see such a peaceful face," he said. "Everyone we find in the water, the drowned and suicides, they never look so peaceful. They're swollen, they don't look nice." Over the centuries, artists and writers may have used the stories of Ophelia and the Lady of Shallot to portray drowning as a romantic and peaceful death but Pascal knows from years of dredging bodies out of the Seine that the truth is very different. Even suicides fight for life at the last moment and their faces betray that struggle. And the process of decomposition starts much more quickly in water too. This woman, he remarked, "looks like she's just asleep and waiting for Prince Charming to come". Like so many others before him, Jacquin's imagination had been piqued by the young woman's face and he had already begun to weave a tale of his own around the closed eyes, that secretive little smile and the enigma of the Inconnue. Other experts we consulted seemed to agree that the Inconnue seemed just too healthy, too vital for the mask to have been taken from a corpse. At the workshop in Arcueil, Michel Lorenzi, the current proprietor, is mystified by people's fascination with the Inconnue. "This doesn't look to me like the face of a dead person. It's very hard to maintain a smile while a cast is being taken so I think she was a professional, a very good model." For me the story has two postscripts. The first came a few weeks after the programme was broadcast in 2009. I was visiting Edward Chambre Hardman's photographic studio in Liverpool, the National Trust's perfectly preserved time capsule from the first half of the 20th Century, where anyone who was anyone in Liverpool sat for a portrait with Hardman. Seeing the mask of the Inconnue on the wall of his waiting room, I asked the guide, disingenuously, who the young woman was. Without hesitating she told me the story of two sisters, identical twins, who'd been born in Liverpool more than a century ago. One of them, she said, had embarked on a love affair with a rich suitor and eloped to Paris, never to be seen again. Many years later the other sister had visited Paris on holiday. Walking down a street she was shocked to see the mask of the drowned Inconnue hanging outside the mouleurs' workshops. She had instantly recognised the girl as her long-lost twin, condemned - or blessed - to remain forever young, while her sister grew old. I was captivated by the story. Once again, a tapestry of imagination had been woven around the enigma of the Inconnue and in this case it had been given a Liverpool twist. The other postscript comes from an Oxford-based artist called John Goto. Several years ago he decided to create his own fiction for the Inconnue. He constructed an apparently factual account of detective work and a trail of clues leading to the discovery of a turn-of-the-century carte de visite in a Buenos Aires junk shop. This and other evidence supposedly proved finally and beyond doubt the identity of the Inconnue - she was as a Hungarian actress named Ewa Lazlo, who was murdered by her lover, Louis Argon. Goto put the story and its "supporting evidence" online and moved on to other projects. It was intriguing, therefore, to come across details of this week's London symposium for European Restart a Heart Day. During the day a series of speakers share the latest research on improving survival rates after cardiac arrest. But in the evening entertainment is provided by the ensemble Mulberry Hawk. They're putting on a performance which, according to the blurb, "tells the story of Ewa Lazlo who became the inspiration for the face of Resusci Anne, the first CPR training manikin, and the most kissed girl in the world". So, I thought, Ewa is beginning to take on a life of her own. In fact several websites and blogs are quoting as fact that she's the Inconnue. Goto admits to feeling a little uncomfortable with his creation. "I'd assumed that people would have a postmodern view and treat it as fictional," he told me. "I really didn't expect them to take it seriously." But even if Ewa is an object lesson in not believing quite everything you read on the internet, it's unlikely that the story will go much further. What we love about the Inconnue is the uncertainty, the enigma. As Louise Welsh remarked when we returned from recording our search for this drowned Mona Lisa in Paris, the mask's value lies in its mystery. "The moment we have a name, a life story, that mystery is dead." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>A would-be bridegroom who made a hoax bomb threat to a wedding venue after realising he had failed to confirm his booking has been jailed. Neil McArdle, 36, of Medbourne Crescent, Liverpool, realised his error the day before he was due to marry at St George's Hall in the city in April. Rather than tell fiancee Amy Williams, he made a bomb-threat call from a phone box, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was given a 12-month jail sentence after admitting making the hoax call. McArdle could not face telling Miss Williams, the "love of his life", that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen, the court heard. So as she got dressed on the morning of the wedding he slipped out of the house, went to a phone box and, disguising his voice, told the receptionist at Liverpool Register Office, which is part of St George's Hall: "This is not a hoax call. "There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" and the building was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. Miss Williams was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party. But his would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Miss Williams's sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and McArdle was arrested the same day, admitting to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked and staged the bomb scare after bungling the wedding booking forms. He later pleaded guilty to communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Miss Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. Barrister Charles Lander, defending, said: "If it wasn't so serious the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." However, he said McArdle realised this was "no laughing matter". Judge Norman Wright said it was an "extremely serious" case, with custody the only appropriate sentence. </body>

Liverpool Youth Court had been told the 15-year-old boy acted as if he was in a "real-life video game". The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was described in court as a "model pupil". The court heard he stole more than Â£2,000 from a branch of Barclays in Liverpool on 20 September. He was handed to the police by his mother, who was shocked to find cash, stained with dye, and a fake gun in his bedroom. The teenager pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery last month and one count of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. </body>

      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental ill health. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 200 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <body>Police investigating the unexplained death of a woman found in a street in Warwickshire are trying to find her mobile phone and handbag. Patricia Dornan, 39, was found dead near the Alma Lodge Hotel at the junction of James Street and Albert Street, Rugby, on Thursday. Results from a post-mortem examination were inconclusive, police said. A woman arrested in connection with her death on Thursday has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. Warwickshire Police said it was still trying to establish the circumstances of her death and officers were waiting for the results of toxicology tests. A spokesman for the force said: "We would like to hear from anyone who saw Patricia or who had contact with her between [3pm] and midnight on Wednesday 16 October, as we continue to piece together her movements." Detectives said they wanted to find Ms Dornan's white and pink iPhone and a dark-coloured shoulder bag she was believed to have been carrying. In a statement Ms Dornan's mother, Hilly, said: "My daughter was beautiful, both on the inside and the outside. I just want to know what happened to my beautiful daughter." </body>

      <body>Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani's appeal against extradition to South Africa is to be reopened, judges at the High Court indicated. It is the latest move by the 33-year-old Bristol businessman to halt his removal from the UK to face trial over his wife's death. Mr Dewani is accused of plotting to kill 28-year-old Anni Dewani, who was shot in Cape Town in November 2010. He was told in July he will be extradited to South Africa for trial. The extradition was first ordered by a senior district judge in 2011. It was appealed to the High Court in 2012, where it was sent back to the district judge. In July, Mr Dewani's extradition was ordered once again. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas has now indicated that the original appeal will be reopened. A point of law was left open at the original appeal - whether Mr Dewani is deemed to be an "accused" under the Extradition Act. A second issue relates to whether it is unjust to extradite a person such as Mr Dewani, who it has been agreed is unfit to plead. Speaking outside the court, Anni Dewani's mother Nilam Hindocha said it was "nearly three years since she was killed and we have kept our dignity and respect throughout". "I was brought up to believe British justice is the best in the world, so it is very hard to understand why we are still here. "I am the mother of a murdered daughter.

Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985 in June. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal. An independent forfeiture committee decides whether recipients should lose honours if they have brought the system into disrepute.

      <title>PCs sacked over stun gun misuse</title>
      <description>Two police officers are sacked after the police watchdog upholds a complaint by a man who was shot five times with a stun gun in Liverpool.</description>

      <body>Two police officers have been sacked after a man was wrongly arrested and shot five times with a stun gun in Liverpool. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) upheld a complaint by Kyle McArdle who was arrested for urinating in an alley in 2009. Mr McArdle, 26, was later cleared by magistrates of assaulting two PCs. Merseyside Police said it welcomed the watchdog's comments and it was now reviewing its use of Tasers. PCs Simon Jones and Joanne Kelly were dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary hearing while a third officer, a sergeant, had already been dismissed from the force for an unrelated matter. "I feel that justice has now been done and I can get on with my life," said Mr McArdle. He was arrested in December 2009 when he was spotted urinating in an alley off Elliot Street. He was put into a van and shot five times with a Taser, three times with the weapon pressed against his chest, leg and upper abdomen. The arresting officers claimed he was violent and the Taser was needed to restrain him. Taser barbs were also removed from his chest by an officer despite guidelines which say they should normally be removed by a medical professional. The officer claimed he feared Mr McArdle would remove them himself to use as weapons. Mr McArdle complained that the repeated use of a Taser in the confined space of a police van was disproportionate. The IPCC upheld his subsequent appeal and recommended Merseyside re-investigate, considering if the Taser use would be justified had the victim been lawfully arrested. Merseyside Police's leading Taser instructor found that the Taser use was "necessary, proportionate, reasonable and in line with the officers' training". The watchdog upheld a second appeal, finding that the officers should have been served with notices for gross misconduct and interviewed under caution. In the UK, Tasers are prohibited weapons under the 1968 Firearms Act. A 12-month trial of Tasers by 10 police forces in England and Wales, with specially trained units including Merseyside Police, began in September 2007. It was extended the following year to all forces in England and Wales. Those officers using Tasers are trained and when used, the officers have to justify their actions as being "necessary and proportionate under the law". IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: "While we welcome the robust action eventually taken by the force in response to our appeal findings it is a concern that Merseyside's lead Taser instructor lacked objectivity and presented as fact the officers' version of events without challenge." </body>

      <body>Five men have been held in connection with a smash-and-grab raid in which watches worth almost Â£1.5m were stolen from London's Selfridges store. The men were arrested earlier when police raided eight addresses in Islington, north London. They are also being held over a robbery at a jewellery store in Windsor in Berkshire, in April. Two men have already been jailed for the Selfridges robbery which took place in June. Sam Curtin, 24, and Connor Groake, 19, both from Islington, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle-taking. Curtin was sentenced to 10 years while Groake was jailed for seven years, at Kingston Crown Court in July. Det Insp Bob Currie said the arrests showed "that the Flying Squad will continue to pursue those who choose to commit these types of offences, gathering the necessary intelligence to arrest them and bring them before the courts". </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <body>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is accused of carrying out the offences between 1976 and 2008. The allegations relate to 11 female complainants, aged between 15 and 29 at the time. The 68-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court under his real name, David Patrick Griffin. His trial date was set for 14 January 2014. It is expected to last five to six weeks. Mr Travis, of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree officers in November last year. The Metropolitan Police investigation was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile. The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others". Mr Travis's arrest fell within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation. He is currently on bail on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims. Mr Travis denied the following counts in court on Tuesday: </body>

      <title>Network Rail comments 'inhuman'</title>
      <description>A mother whose daughter was killed by a train in Essex says the way Network Rail spoke to her was "inhuman".</description>

      <body>A mother whose daughter was killed by a train in Essex said the way Network Rail had spoken to her was "inhuman". Friends Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in December 2005 as they crossed the railway line at Elsenham station. Olivia's mother Tina Hughes told the Transport Select Committee the firm said it had to "consider the cost of safety versus the value of life". She said it was "an... inhuman way to speak to me as a bereaved parent". The comment had been made to Ms Hughes weeks after her daughter's death. Olivia's father, Chris Bazlinton, appearing alongside Ms Hughes, said he believed information about their deaths had been covered up in a "conspiracy of silence". He told the committee inquiry into level crossings on Monday that Network Rail did not reveal a damning risk assessment carried out at Elsenham before the tragedy. "I still want to know from the people at the top who are ultimately responsible why they withheld those documents and why I should believe it won't happen again." The documents highlighting concerns at the crossing were not disclosed until 2010, and the firm was fined Â£1m last year for health and safety breaches, with the judge concluding there had been "culpable corporate blindness". Mr Bazlinton said he had received "shabby treatment" from Network Rail after the tragedy and added: "I happen to believe that not much has changed at Network Rail in the way that they treat these incidents." Ms Hughes, who is advising Network Rail about crossing safety, told MPs: "I believe that they have made very significant changes but... there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done." Laurence Hoggart, whose wife Jean, 56, and grandson Michael Dawson, seven, died on the pedestrian crossing in Bestwood Village in Nottinghamshire in November 2008, also gave evidence in a statement at the hearing. "This has devastated my life and my family's life. I think that Network Rail have treated me badly. "They wrote just one letter of apology, my solicitors discovered that the crossing was seen to be unsafe by Railtrack in 2000 and their advisers said a bridge should be built," he said. Committee chairwoman Louise Ellman said it appeared from the evidence given by Mr Bazlinton and Mr Hoggart that in both the Elsenham and Bestwood incidents "Network Rail appeared to know that there was a problem but hadn't done anything about it". In a statement, Network Rail said: "Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at level crossings but we have promised them that we are committed to making our railway as safe as possible and that remains our focus." The company will be giving evidence to the committee at a later date. </body>

      <body>A pay error, which led to thousands of hospital staff receiving their wages late, cost an NHS Trust almost Â£2,500. South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust workers were hit by the delay in August after "human error". The trust paid bank charges of more than 60 staff as a result of the mistake, a Freedom of Information request from BBC News found. A spokeswoman for the trust said new protocols were now in place to prevent a repeat. She said: "We now have control checks to mitigate risk at all stages of the payroll process, tighter processes in the payroll department and three signatures need to be obtained, including one from a senior member of the finance team, to verify dates and amounts." About 8,500 staff received their pay up to three days late. The trust runs James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough and the Friarage in Northallerton. </body>

      <body>A second man has admitted his involvement in the death of a disabled man whose burnt body was found in Bristol. Stephen Norley, 24, who was originally charged with murder but that charge was dropped, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender at Bristol Crown Court. Bijan Ebrahimi's body was found burning in Brislington in July. Earlier this month Lee James, 24, from Capgrave Crescent, Bristol, admitted the Iranian's murder. Andrew Langdon, prosecuting, told the hearing that Norley, of Capgrave Crescent, had helped James drag Mr Ebrahimi's body away from the scene of the attack and had assisted in setting fire to his body by obtaining white spirit. "Mr Norley's acceptance of guilt is a proportionate outcome in the light of Mr James's much more substantial role." Michael Fitton, representing Norley, said: "The defendant is well aware he will be made subject of an immediate prison sentence." Six police officers are under investigation for gross misconduct following the death of Mr Ebrahimi. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said four constables, a sergeant and an inspector had been served with notices of gross misconduct. The watchdog said Mr Ebrahimi had been in contact with officers from the force in the days before his death. He had been arrested on 12 July on suspicion of a breach of the peace and released later the same day. A family statement said Mr Ebrahimi's life was taken from them in the "most callous and unforgivable way". "Bijan was a quiet disabled man whose only joys in life came from his horticultural interests and his cat. "Our family has been torn apart... we beg, absolutely beg for anyone who may have been an eyewitness or seen absolutely any part of the disgusting ordeal to be brave enough to step forward and give information to police," the family added. </body>

      <body>Scratch and sniff cards to help people detect cannabis farms have resulted in a 28% increase in reports of cultivation, Crimestoppers said. More than 200,000 cards were issued by the charity to hotspots including London, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire and Avon and Somerset. The cards release a scent that replicates the growing plant to help people identify the smell of cannabis. The initiative was inspired by a pilot set up in Holland three years ago. The three-month campaign was launched by Crimestoppers in March. Since then the crime-fighting charity said it had received more than 3,500 pieces of information from the public on cannabis cultivation - a 28% increase on the same period last year. Using the information generated, the Metropolitan Police seized more than Â£2.1m worth of the drug and closed down 34 cannabis factories. Merseyside Police received a 56% increase in pieces of intelligence in the first month of the campaign and at least 25 cannabis farms were identified. Whilst South Yorkshire Police seized Â£89,000 worth of cannabis plants and made 15 arrests. Mark Hallas, the charity's chief executive, said the organisation's commitment to fighting crime had "never been stronger". "We continue to be proactive and determined in exploring new and innovative ways to educate, empower and encourage the UK public to put their trust in Crimestoppers," he said. "Working with communities and government agencies, we believe Crimestoppers to be a truly effective crime-fighting charity that will continue to have a highly significant and successful impact on keeping communities safe." </body>

      <title>Singer Noel Harrison dies aged 79</title>
      <description>The singer Noel Harrison, best known for his hit The Windmills Of Your Mind, dies at his home in Devon, aged 79.</description>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>A couple have won the right not to file online VAT returns for their honey business after claiming it was contrary to their religious beliefs. Beekeepers Graham and Abigail Blackburn, from Cornwall, are members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church and they reject using computers at home. A tribunal ruled that by refusing an exemption the government had breached their right to manifest their religion. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs said it was considering an appeal. Mr Blackburn told the First Tier Tribunal, at Bodmin Law Courts, that he and his wife rejected the use of computers, the internet, televisions and mobile phones in their home. The contents of some TV programmes and websites were "contrary to the Bible's teachings" in his view and he wanted to "protect his children from bad influences". The couple believe Christ's second coming is imminent and view the internet as an intrusion of "worldliness" into their lives of "righteousness". Most businesses are required by law to file their VAT returns online, and HMRC lawyers argued the couple's refusal to do so was a personal preference and not part of their religion. However, Tribunal Judge Barbara Mosedale ruled that by refusing to exempt Mr and Mrs Blackburn from online filing, HMRC had breached their right to freely manifest their religion under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. She said: "I find that, by entirely shunning computers, they considered they were acting, as the Bible required them to do, in accordance with their religious conscience. "They were manifesting their religious beliefs by refusing to use computers." Justifications put forward by HMRC for refusing to exempt the couple were "clearly insufficient", she added. The tribunal found in favour of the couple who run Cornish Moorland Honey, in Bodmin, on 2 October but judgement was only released earlier. The tribunal verdict means the couple will now be permitted to file their VAT returns on paper, subject to any appeal by HMRC. </body>

      <description>Pajtim Kasami's goal for Fulham against Crystal Palace is better than Marco van Basten's famous volley, says Dutchman Martin Jol.</description>

      <body>Pajtim Kasami's stunning goal for Fulham at Crystal Palace was better than Marco van Basten's Euro 88 volley, according to Cottagers boss Martin Jol. Kasami's goal, a fine dipping effort from across his body in a 4-1 win, drew comparisons with Van Basten's legendary Netherlands effort. Dutchman Jol said: "It was better than you think. He controlled it on his chest and put it in the other corner. "Marco's was very different. You can't compare them, but this was better!" Van Basten's goal against the Soviet Union in the final of Euro 88 is widely held to be the greatest ever scored at any European Championship finals. He met Arnold Muhren's deep cross on the volley almost at the byeline and powered a dipping shot over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. Kasami considers his strike to be the best of his career. "I have never scored a better goal," said the Switzerland international. "I ran into the space and the pass was perfect. It was an unbelievable goal and I am very pleased." The strike even prompted Jack Wilshere, who scored a superb goal of his own in Arsenal's win over Norwich on Saturday, to tweet:Â  "Well there's my 'goal of the month' prize gone!!!! Take a bow!" Having climbed to 14th, within one point of eighth-placed Manchester United, Jol admitted it was a vital victory for his team. Fulham went behind to Adrian Mariappa's early header before Kasami's 19th-minute goal proved the catalyst for a stirring comeback. "It was unbelievably important to get a result," said Jol. "It was a game of importance for Palace, too, but we needed the three points. "The goal we conceded was sickening, but we showed some response and it was a fantastic Pajtim goal with his wrong foot. I haven't seen him do that before. It is one of the goals of the season." Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell, who followed up Kasami's strike with a memorable 25-yard volley of his own, believes the win has taken the pressure off Jol. "Going a goal down early was a bit of a blow but we knew, if we kept plugging away, chances would come," Sidwell told Sky Sports 1. Sidwell said Kasami's strike helped inspire the Fulham players. "We needed something special to get back into the game and it certainly was something special," said Sidwell. </body>

In an interview with Forty-20 magazine in July, the forward said he wanted to quit as he was "sick of losing"Â  and did not play for the club again. Clubb, 26, told BBC London 94.9: "It was probably more frustration at the time but I don't regret what I said." The England international's Broncos team-mate, Dan Sarginson, is also joining double winners Wigan. In 2014 they will swap London, who only avoided bottom spot in the table by winning their final two Super League matches, for a Wigan side that won the Challenge Cup at Wembley in August and also October's Grand Final. Financial problems dominated the 2013 season in the capital and, with the future of the Broncos uncertain, several members of the first-team squad - including hooker Tommy Lee [to Salford], utility back Luke Dorn and prop Scott Wheeldon [both to Castleford] - have departed. "I was sick of losing," continued Clubb, who had a spell as captain of the Broncos last term. "It was the manner we were losing. I'll pick up on the Warrington game - to get beaten by 80 points was embarrassing for me, for the players and for our fans. "We had a bad season considering the players we had brought in over the past couple of years, we brought a new coach in, and how we finished the season before. I thought things were going to go well but it didn't pan out that way." Although unhappy with the way his time with the Broncos ended, Gravesend-born Clubb added that he owes a lot to the club for helping his career. "I'm thankful for what they've done for me as a player and a person, and I won't forget that," he said. "If London weren't there, what would have happened? Thankfully they were. I was in the right place at the right time, London picked me up and now I'm moving to Wigan." </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>A popular and humane way to outwit our friend</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>
      <date>1382403985</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70633000/jpg/_70633978_garden2.bbc.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>Norway note in bottle sparks appeal</title>
      <description>Norwegian family try to trace London girl who sent it in 1986</description>

      <body>A Norwegian family is trying to trace a British woman who placed a message in a bottle in 1996. The note written by the then 12-year-old Loretta Brooks from London was washed up off Rjaneset in April last year and found by a sister and brother. Mia and Martin Rodal, now aged 10 and eight, spotted it while on a walk with their parents but their own postal response did not elicit a reply. Despite turning to social media, they have been unable to locate Loretta. "Finding a letter in a bottle is a kids' dream. It is like finding a secret treasure," said Mia and Martin's father Gunnar. "The kids talked about treasure hunting by the sea, and finding a message that had drifted across the North Sea for 16 years was an exciting experience. "But we have tried all options we could think of to find Loretta." It is not known where the bottle containing the letter, dated 14 July 1996, started its journey but it could have potentially travelled more than 800 miles (1,300km) from the UK to Norway. Mia and Martin, from Oslo, spotted the plastic bottle during an Easter holiday visit to their grandparents, who live on Norway's west coast. "They were about four metres away but said they could see a message in a bottle," said Mr Rodal, a 42-year-old sales executive. "It was surrounded by slippery rocks so I took it out of the water for them." In the brief letter, Loretta described herself as a "girl from England". "I don't know who you are but anyway... What is your name? Send me a letter," she wrote. Mr Rodal said: "Mia was fascinated by the thought of a 12-year-old girl that she maybe could be friends with. It took a little bit of time to understand that she would not be 12 anymore." But Loretta did not give her full address on the letter, only including what appears to be an incomplete postcode. She wrote her address as either London E 436, or London E 43G, England, suggesting she lived in the east of the capital. Despite the lack of details, the family decided to send a response, together with a photocopy of Loretta's letter and the original bottle. "I added my own address and an explanation on the envelope but we didn't hear anything," said Mr Rodal. He said: "Of course there is every chance that Loretta had moved and maybe changed her name. But we have tried to find her using Facebook, Linkedin and other online options." More than a year later, Mr Rodal said he was inspired again to try to trace Loretta after reading a newspaper story this month about a letter dropped into the sea in Cornwall in September 1994. That letter was found by a remote beach near the town of Hauge in Norway and traced to its sender Lucy Elliot, who is now 31, and living in Northamptonshire. </body>

Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985 in June. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal. An independent forfeiture committee decides whether recipients should lose honours if they have brought the system into disrepute. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the original sentence was "unduly lenient" given the impact on Hall's victims.

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested Â£150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBCâ¦ was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around Â£5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost Â£2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new Â£150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. They were given a backstage tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner and watched rehearsals for forthcoming family show Emil and the Detectives. Their visit marked the anniversary of the first performance at the theatre Peter O'Toole opened the venue on 22 October 1963, playing Hamlet under the eye of founder Sir Laurence Olivier. More than 800 productions have taken place at the venue in the intervening 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit, the Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed a musical number from Guys and Dolls, which was the first musical staged at the National, in 1982. Starring Bob Hoskins and Julia McKenzie, the production ran for four years, breaking all box office records. The royal visitors also visited the props workshop and unveil a plaque to commemorate the theatre's 50th anniversary. Originally based at the Old Vic, the NT moved to the South Bank in 1976, where it remains. It also has a foot planted in the West End, where several of its productions - including War Horse and One Man, Two Guv'nors - have transferred. The institution's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith, will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony, "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. The event will be screened on the BBC, which has also commissioned two hour-long Arena specials on the history of the theatre. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry." "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <description>Lou Scheimer, who founded the Filmation animation studio which produced He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, dies aged 84.</description>

      <body>Lou Scheimer, the founder of the Filmation animation studio which produced He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, has died aged 84. Pittsburgh native Scheimer died on Thursday, two days before his 85th birthday, his wife Mary Ann said. Alongside his success with He-Man and The Archie Show, he won a daytime Emmy award for the 1974-75 season of the Star Trek animated series. He leaves his wife, his daughter, Erika and his son, Lane. Born in Pennsylvania in 1928, he graduated from Carnegie Tech University in Pittsburgh, with a bachelors degree in Fine Arts in 1952. He, along with partners Hal Sutherland and Norm Prescott, founded Filmation in 1962 with a $5,000 loan from his mother-in-law, so-named because: "We were working on film, but doing animation". Filmation's first major project was an animated sequel to The Wizard of Oz, followed in 1966 by an animated Superman series and then The Archie Show - based on the successful US comic books. Filmation's animated Star Trek series was widely praised and featured the voices of the show's original cast, including William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. In 1983, the company was approached by toy makers Mattel to produce a series based on their line of action figures He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. The cartoon ran for two seasons, each with 65 episodes. Filmation's animation style sacrificed a degree of quality for the sake of quantity. Cartoons often appeared slightly jerky because of the cost-cutting use of fewer than the regular 24 frames a second. However, He-Man was one of the most popular children's programmes of the 80s and was ranked by IGN magazine, in 2009, as the 58th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list. It has since gone on to become a cult favourite on home media. Scheimer, also provided the voice of the magical character Orko and voiced several other animated characters through the years. The franchise was adapted for the big screen, starring Dolph Lundgren as the titular muscle-bound "most powerful man in the universe". With comedian Bill Cosby, Scheimer created Fat Albert, considered to be ground-breaking as the one of the first animated series centring on African American characters. Filmation closed in 1989 and Scheimer formed a new company called Lou Scheimer Productions. He retired several years ago. His cause of death has not been revealed but he was understood to have been suffering from Parkinson's Disease. DreamWorks purchased the Filmation library last year. </body>

      <body>TV and film streaming service Netflix has seen global subscriber numbers surge past 40 million and profits jump, thanks in part to its popular original programmes. The firm behind prison drama Orange is the New Black said its net profit rose to $32m (Â£19.8m) in the three months to the end of September. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of Â£7m. Shares in the firm rose 10% in after-hours trading on Monday. Netflix executives said its investment in original programmes had helped to drive profit. Its other self-produced shows included political drama House Of Cards. It now plans to double its investment in original content, but said it would still account for less than 10% of the overall output it offers. "Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable content ever produced," Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings and chief financial officer David Wells said in a letter to investors. The California-based company is considering further television shows, as well as starting to make its own movies. "We are actively looking right now at a few documentary projects. We'd like to do more of that in the movie space," said chief content officer Ted Sarandos. Netflix subscribers watched a total of about five billion hours of films and television shows in the last quarter, according to Mr Hastings. Netflix's shares rose to $388.50 in after-hours trading on Monday, compared with their close of $354.99 on the Nasdaq index. Standard and Poor's equity analyst Tuna Amobi said Netflix had "turned an important corner for potentially sustained subscriber growth". He added: "There is not a whole lot not to like. There is a whole lot of momentum behind the story." " </body>

      <body>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is accused of carrying out the offences between 1976 and 2008. The allegations relate to 11 female complainants, aged between 15 and 29 at the time. The 68-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court under his real name, David Patrick Griffin. His trial date was set for 14 January 2014. It is expected to last five to six weeks. Mr Travis, of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree officers in November last year. The Metropolitan Police investigation was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile. The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others". Mr Travis's arrest fell within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation. He is currently on bail on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims. Mr Travis denied the following counts in court on Tuesday: </body>

      <title>Bolshoi dancer tried for acid attack</title>
      <description>Bolshoi Ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko goes on trial for allegedly organising an acid attack on the company's artistic director.</description>

      <body>A Bolshoi Ballet soloist has gone on trial over an acid attack on the company's artistic director in January. Dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko is accused of organising of the attack on Sergei Filin, whose eyesight was badly damaged when sulphuric acid was thrown at him outside his Moscow flat. Mr Dmitrichenko denies arranging the attack. If convicted, the dancer could face 12 years in jail. The attack revealed bitter infighting and rivalries inside the Bolshoi. Also on trial are the man accused of throwing the acid, Yuri Zarutsky, and Andrei Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car. As the trial began on Tuesday, the tiny Moscow courtroom where it was taking place was packed with journalists as the defendants were led into a caged dock. After initially admitting to masterminding the attack, Mr Dmitrichenko later said he had discussed an assault on Mr Filin but not the use of acid. Following a pre-trial hearing, Mr Dmitrichenko's lawyer alleged that the defendant had been beaten by masked police - a claim that the Russian interior ministry has denied. On Monday, ahead of the trial in Moscow, lawyer Sergei Kadyrov said: "Dmitrichenko does not consider himself guilty of causing grave harm to Filin's health." "I hope the court will be able to distance itself from the public resonance of this case and deliver a well-grounded and just verdict." Mr Filin has had more than 20 operations to try to save his eyesight. Following treatment in Germany, he returned to Moscow for the inauguration of the Bolshoi's season last month, wearing dark glasses. In March, more than 300 members of the Bolshoi Ballet wrote to President Vladimir Putin, saying that the idea that Mr Dmitrichenko was behind the crime was "absurd". </body>

      <title>Turner exhibition to open in Derry</title>
      <description>One of the world's most prestigious art events - the Turner Prize exhibition - is due to open in Northern Ireland with four artists shortlisted to win.</description>

      <body>One of the world's most prestigious art events - the Turner Prize exhibition - will open in Northern Ireland later. It will be held at the old barracks in Ebrington, Derry, as part of the city's year as the UK City of Culture. Now in its 29th year, this is the first time the Turner Prize has been held outside England. Four artists are in contention for the award. The winner will receive Â£25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive Â£5,000. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, French installation artist Laure Prouvost, Britain's David Shrigley and the British-German performance artist Tino Sehgal are on this year's shortlist. Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Previous winners include Damien Hirst, Antony Gormley and last year's recipient, the video artist Elizabeth Price. The Derry event is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Extracts and Verses exhibition at the Chisenhale Gallery. She is of Ghanaian descent and is the first black woman to be in contention for the award. Born in 1977, she attended Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Falmouth College of Arts and the Royal Academy Schools. According to the prize's organisers, her "intriguing" paintings "appear traditional but are in fact much more innovative". Glasgow-based David Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greetings cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. His words have been used in recordings by David Byrne and Franz Ferdinand and he directed the video for Blur's 2009 track Good Song. Born in Macclesfield in 1968, Shrigley is shortlisted for his solo exhibition Brain Activity, at London's Hayward Gallery. The exhibition, said the Turner Prize organisers, was a "comprehensive overview" that revealed "his black humour, macabre intelligence and infinite jest". Born in Lille in 1978, Laure Prouvost won the fourth Max Mara art prize for women in 2011 for her short films and installation work. Based in London, she is shortlisted for her new work Wantee, featured in Tate Britain's Schwitters in Britain exhibition, and her two-part Max Mara art prize installation. Her "unique" approach to film-making, said organisers, "employs strong story-telling, quick cuts, montage and deliberate misuse of language to create surprising and unpredictable work". Born in 1976 and based in Berlin, Tino Sehgal has been shortlisted for his "pioneering" projects This Variation and These Associations. The latter, staged last year at Tate Modern in London, invited the public to interact with volunteers in a "live installation" staged in the gallery's expansive Turbine Hall. "Both structured and improvised, Seghal's intimate works consist purely of live encounters between people and demonstrate a keen sensitivity to their institutional context," said organisers. "Through participatory means, they test the limits of artistic material and audience perception in a new and significant way." This year's jury is chaired by Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis and includes the curator Annie Fletcher and the writer and lecturer Declan Long. Bookmakers Ladbroke have made Shrigley 2/1 favourite to win the prize, ahead of Prouvost, Sehgal and Yiadom-Boakye, a 7/2 outsider. </body>

      <body>Pop star Rihanna was asked to leave a famous Abu Dhabi mosque complex after posing outside the building for an unauthorised photo shoot. The singer tweeted pictures of herself in a black jumpsuit and headscarf on photo-sharing site Instagram. A statement from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre, said she was asked to leave after "inappropriate pictures" were taken. The photos "did not comply with terms and conditions" of organised visits. Rihanna performed live in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The mosque said Rihanna, 25, first arrived "at an entrance that was not designated for visitors". "She was confronted by the mosque officials and directed to the appropriate entrance to the mosque, to carry out a visit under the normal conditions." She was asked to leave after striking a series of poses for the photo shoot. The statement claimed Rihanna turned up at the mosque "without any previous co-ordination with the administration". Several of the photos could be construed as suggestive, with one showing the pop star lying on her back in the mosque's courtyard. The mosque is a major tourist attraction which welcomes non-Muslims - it had more than three million visitors last year. Rihanna's publicity team has yet to make a comment. </body>

The Frankenweenie director is currently working on the film Big Eyes, before going on to direct Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The original Beetlejuice spawned an animated TV series produced by Burton. The film also starred Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Burton has been nominated twice for Oscars in the animated feature category - for Corpse Bride in 2006, and last year for Frankenweenie.

      <body>A shot of mist swirling over a Cumbrian lake has taken the top prize in a national photography award. The image, Crummock Water Mists and Reflections, has seen Derbyshire's Tony Bennett named as the Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year. Mr Bennett said the photograph captured "a moment in time, never to be repeated but always remembered". The picture and the winners of 15 other categories will be on show at London's National Theatre from 7 December. Other photographs on display will be Christopher Page's shot of autumn leaves in Surrey, which saw him named the Young Photographer of the Year, and David Lyon's Ferry leaving Newhaven harbour in storm, which won the Your View category. Mr Bennett said his photograph had been difficult to take as "every second the scene was changing, creating a hundred memorable images". "The still night mist began rolling and tumbling, as if in protest, as the heat of the sun vaporized and dispersed it forever," he said. "Within a minute, it was over - a moment in time, never to be repeated but always remembered." Take a View founder Charlie Waite said Mr Bennett's image represented the talents of UK photographers and their ability to capture the country's natural beauty. "Tony's magical image evokes the spirit of the Lakes - a personal view that speaks to many," he said. </body>

      <body>A piece by Conrad Shawcross has won a competition to replace a stolen Barbara Hepworth sculpture in a London park. Shawcross's Three Perpetual Chords will replace Hepworth's bronze Two Forms (Divided Circle), which was stolen two years ago from Dulwich Park. "It is an honour to have been selected, given the legacy of Barbara Hepworth," Shawcross said. The artist beat other accomplished artists including Turner Prize nominee Anya Gallaccio and Eva Rothschild. Hepworth's sculpture, which was insured for Â£500,000, was stolen by suspected scrap metal thieves from the park in south London. It was cut from its plinth in December 2011 and has never been recovered. The price it could fetch as scrap metal would only be a tiny fraction of its value as a complete work. Shawcross's piece will be made of cast iron and filled with concrete, to make it harder to steal. The competition, organised by the Contemporary Art Society on behalf of Southwark Council, initially stipulated that submitted works could not be made out of metal to prevent thieves targeting it but the rules were changed when Shawcross entered his proposed sculpture. Fabienne Nicholas, head of art consultancy at the Contemporary Art Society, said: "Conrad's series of sculptural works will create a new journey through the park - offering a thoughtfully sequenced experience for park visitors. These are sculptures that give not only aesthetic pleasure but something playful too - they, like the Hepworth, invite a human scale interaction." Dame Barbara Hepworth, who died in 1975 in a fire at her studio in St Ives, Cornwall, is considered to be one of the UK's most important modern sculptors, with her work displayed in museums and public spaces around the world. Shawcross found fame when his wooden sculpture, The Nervous System, was bought by Charles Saatchi ten years ago. He recently showcased a timepiece installation in Camden's Roundhouse venue in north London. </body>

      <body>As parliamentary polls get under way in the Czech Republic this week, artist David Cerny has floated a huge purple statue of an extended middle finger down the River Vltava in Prague. The outsized purple hand has been mounted on a barge floating on the river. It is pointed at Prague Castle, the seat of President Milos Zeman. Mr Cerny has shocked and mocked politicians and public figures in the past, says the BBC's Rob Cameron. This latest piece is clearly his message to the leftist President Zeman and the political party recently set up by his supporters, our correspondent says. It is unclear how long the finger will stay there; Cerny himself declined to say too much about the piece, telling reporters the gesture spoke for itself - what mattered, he said, was which way it was pointing. President Zeman, meanwhile, is on an official visit to Ukraine and said he could not comment until he had seen it. The Czech parliament was dissolved in August following weeks of turmoil in Czech politics. Prime Minister Petr Necas's government collapsed in June amid a bribery scandal, and a government of technocrats, formed by President Zeman in July and opposed by the main political parties, resigned in August. </body>

      <body>Sandra Bullock's space thriller Gravity has held on to the top of the US and Canadian box office for a third week. The 3D thriller, co-starring George Clooney, took $31 million (Â£19m) according to figures from Rentrak. Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, stayed in second place, taking $17.3 million (Â£10.6m) in its second week. WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, had 2013's worst debut weekend so far, taking just $1.7m. (Â£1m) Assange, who founded whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, had claimed Disney's film would be a failure. Last week, an email he wrote to Cumberbatch urging him not to take part in the project was released online. Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuaron and starring Bullock and Clooney as astronauts stranded in space, has now made more than $170m (Â£105m) in three weeks. IMAX screenings have proved particularly popular because of the film's groundbreaking visuals, accounting for $38m (Â£23m) in ticket sales, with 82% of audiences opting for 3D showings. Warner Brothers' Jeffrey Goldstein has attributed the film's success to "phenomenal word of mouth". Paul Greengrass's true story-based Somali pirate drama Captain Philips also held off newcomer Carrie. The horror remake, starring Kick-Ass actress Chloe Grace Moretz, took third place, with $17m (Â£10m). The original 1976 film, based on Stephen King's novel, saw Oscar nominations for actresses Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Family favourite, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, was in fourth after taking $10.1m (Â£6.2m) in its fourth week. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's new action film Escape Plan rounded off the top five with $9.8m (Â£6m). In a limited release of just 19 cinemas, Steve McQueen's Oscar-tipped slavery epic 12 Years a Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, opened with a promising $960,000 (Â£594,000). </body>

      <description>Holocaust drama Ida wins best film at the Warsaw Film Festival but Polish director PaweÅ Pawlikowski misses the ceremony to accept the same prize in London.</description>

      <body>Polish director PaweÅ Pawlikowski won best film at the Warsaw Film Festival on Saturday - but missed the event to accept the same prize in London. His film, Ida, tells the story of a novice nun who must confront a family secret, dating from the Nazi occupation, before taking her vows. The Warsaw jury called it "a beautiful and delicate film" about post-war Poland "trying to get past its demons". Actress Agata Kulesza accepted the Grand Prix on Pawlikowski's behalf. The jury's decision was based on "the superb combination of script, directing, cinematography, acting and music," they added in a statement. Now based in Paris, Pawlikowski first made his name as a feature filmmaker in the UK. He received a Bafta for best newcomer with Last Resort in 2000, and went on to win best film at the Edinburgh Film Festival with My Summer of Love in 2004. Ida is his first film to be made in his native country. The director has admitted that people had doubts about the black-and-white film, which was shot with a static camera and features actors unknown outside Poland. Some said it could have been "a little bit of professional hara-kiri," he said. "But it doesn't seem to be the case, so I'm really relieved." At the BFI London Film Festival, Ida beat competition from the likes of Parkland, about the assassination of John F Kennedy, and Under The Skin, which stars Scarlett Johansson as "a voracious alien in human form". Philip French, president of London's official competition jury, described Ida as a "courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation - the German occupation and the Holocaust - which continues to resonate". </body>

      <title>Poppins film gets world premiere</title>
      <description>Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson attend the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a film about the long and difficult process of making the classic Disney musical Mary Poppins.</description>

      <body>Emma Thompson has admitted she loved the "belligerence" of her character in Saving Mr Banks, a film about the long and difficult process of making the Disney musical Mary Poppins. The film, which stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, had its world premiere in London on Sunday night. It officially brought this year's BFI London Film Festival to a close. Both Thompson and Hanks walked the red carpet in Leicester Square to the delight of hundreds of fans who had braved heavy rain earlier in the day. The film focuses on the real-life battle of wills between prickly author PL Travers, played by Thompson, and Walt Disney over the movie rights to her famous literary creation. Directed by John Lee Hancock, the film is already being tipped for Oscar success. It is not released in the UK until 29 November. Hanks, who walked the damp and chilly red carpet holding a mug of tea, told the BBC it had been "an honour" that two of his films had opened and closed the 10-day film festival. The festival kicked off with maritime thriller Captain Phillips, a true story in which Hanks plays a ship's captain taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009. Speaking about his role as Walt Disney, Tom Hanks said: "In a lot of ways Mary Poppins was the crowning achievement of everything he did, it won all the Academy Awards, it was a huge monster hit and it was the last movie that he truly was hands-on." Speaking to the BBC, Thompson said she had found the role of PL Travers "really difficult". The Australian-born British author was interesting, she said, because she was "full of contradictions". In reality, Walt Disney had spent some 20 years in pursuit of the film rights to Mary Poppins. The main focus of the film is the two weeks in 1961 that Travers reluctantly spent with Disney in Los Angeles as he tried to win her over. During the visit she was played songs by the Sherman brothers, which ended up in the 1964 film, such as A Spoonful of Sugar and Let's Go Fly a Kite. "What was fun was inhabiting someone who refused to let the fairy dust work," said Thompson. "I loved her belligerence, I loved playing her rudeness, and her honesty." She said she had wanted to work with Tom Hanks for years "then suddenly along came this very grown up drama about two artists who are both very complicated people, who expressed their traumas in very different ways, because they both had extremely difficult childhoods". Travers, who died in 1996, so disliked the Oscar-winning Disney production that she never allowed any more Mary Poppins books to be adapted into films. The cast of Saving Mr Banks also includes Irish actor Colin Farrell and English actress Ruth Wilson, who play the parents of the young PL Travers in 1906 Australia. Asked about seeing the film premiere in London, screenwriter Kelly Marcel said: "It means everything to me. It's a home grown project that was written here in England so to close the London Film Festival feels like we are bring it home." BFI London Film Festival director Clare Stewart said there had been a "great audience response" to this year's festival. She said that the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks was a magical way to bring the event to a close. She added: "There is a moment in the film when Walt Disney says to PL Travers that audiences around the world 'from Leicester Square to Kansas City' will be moved by Mary Poppins, and so I had to have that film in Leicester Square." At the festival's awards ceremony on Saturday night, Sir Christopher Lee was presented with his fellowship from the British Film Institute by his friend Johnny Depp. The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. The festival included gala screenings of Stephen Frears' Philomena, the true story of a woman's search for her lost son starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch. Other films included Alfonso Cuaron's space-odyssey thriller Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes' The Invisible Woman, a period romance centring on the affair between Charles Dickens and actress Nelly Ternan, and the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene. </body>

      <title>David Bowie misses out on Q Awards</title>
      <description>Rock legend David Bowie fails to win any prizes at the Q Awards, despite nominations in six categories, and is trounced by Ellie Goulding in the prize for best solo artist.</description>

      <body>Rock legend David Bowie has been left empty-handed at this year's Q Awards, despite receiving six nominations. A shocked Ellie Goulding beat him to the prize for best solo artist, while Scottish rockers Biffy Clyro trounced him in the best album category. Accepting the prize, singer Simon Neil said: "I think I speak on every award winner's behalf when I say thank goodness David Bowie didn't turn up." The winners are chosen by readers of Q magazine and its website. Pop star Goulding told the BBC her win was "very unexpected", but that Bowie "not being around might have something to do with it". "I was very shocked - and nervous because I'm terrible at public speaking." New York quartet Vampire Weekend were named "best act in the world today", and joked the award was a vindication. "The first show Vampire Weekend ever did was a battle of the bands at our college," said frontman Ezra Koenig. "It was four bands and we came in third place. "So we've always had a complex - we're not even the second best, not even in our college. "So now, even if it's just for one day, to be called the best act in the world really feels like a nice 'screw you' to those guys that beat us." Other awards went to Arctic Monkeys, who won best single for Do I Wanna Know?; while Welsh band The Manic Street Preachers took home best video, for Show Me The Wonder. A miniature love story starring Submarine actor Craig Roberts, the video was filmed in the Pioneer Working Men's Club in Porth, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales. Comic Al Murray quipped as the band picked up their award: "The Manic Street Preachers: Apart from Doctor Who, the only industry left in Wales." Glastonbury won best event of 2013, beating Bowie's exhibition at the VandA Museum, and Kraftwerk's series of 3D live shows at Tate Modern. The award was presented by Ronnie Wood, who headlined Glastonbury with the Rolling Stones this summer. But he seemed not to recognise Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily, introducing them on the stage as "the organiser and his partner". He later apologised for the mistake, and Michael Eavis seemed unfazed - praising the Stones' "absolutely brilliant" set. But the Stones were beaten by Oxford rockers Foals in the battle to be named best live band. Lead singer Yannis Philippakis, said: "It shows you don't need a backing track, you don't need affectation, you don't need Elvis Presley impersonations". The latter comment was a thinly-veiled jibe at Arctic Monkeys' frontman Alex Turner, who has recently adopted a fulsome quiff and some of Elvis's stage mannerisms. Philippakis later told the BBC that concerts should be "magic" and "alchemy". "I just think you don't need a schtick. It doesn't need to turn into Blackpool, Butlins stuff." Bowie had been expected to win several prizes following his surprise comeback in January, The Next Day marked the 66-year-old's return after a 10-year hiatus, and was awarded five stars in Q's April edition. The magazine called it "a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that... sound like they desperately need to be sung". Award host Al Murray said: "The audience are intelligent persons of sophisticated taste and intuition. I'll let them surmise their own conclusion from the fact Bowie wasn't here and didn't win anything." However, he was not the only artist to walk away empty-handed. Daft Punk, the French dance duo whose inescapable single Get Lucky has contributed to the best year for British single sales in history, also failed to win any of the three categories in which they were nominated. The annual ceremony also distributes a number of lifetime achievement awards, decided by "Q's resident musical experts". This year's recipients included Chrissie Hynde (classic songwriter), Robbie Williams (Q Idol) and reinvigorated rock band Suede (Q Icon). Williams joked as he collected his award: "Sorry I couldn't be here in person to receive this. "Of all the made-up awards to get a celebrity to an awards show, this is definitely one of them." Williams was also on hand to present The Pet Shop Boys with the Outstanding Contribution to Music award. "It's great they get this," he said, adding they "invented a blueprint for pop" and calling them "my favourite band". Q's senior editor Matt Mason said: "We keep being told that these are tough times for the industry, but the evidence here suggests the opposite. "We're particularly delighted to salute evergreen artists such as Robbie, the Pet Shop Boys and Suede, who've all made excellent new music over the last 12 months. "They're brilliant reminders of the enduring power of the great British pop act." </body>

      <description>The BBC should become the UK's biggest mutual company to make it more accountable to licence fee payers, former culture secretary Dame Tessa Jowell says.</description>

      <body>The BBC should become the UK's biggest mutual company to make it more accountable to licence fee payers, a former culture secretary has said. Labour's Dame Tessa Jowell told MPs this would "raise public confidence" following recent difficulties. Mutual companies are owned by all members, with no external shareholders. Dame Tessa said this arrangement would put the public "in the driving seat" and allow them a greater say, and prevent government interference. The MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, who left frontbench politics last year after working on the Olympics, said such a move could transform accountability at the BBC. Her comments come after negative publicity over pay-outs to top executives and the handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Dame Tessa said: "It is the public and the licence fee payers who should be in the driving seat. So the argument would be the BBC should indeed be owned by its licence fee payers. The BBC should become the country's biggest mutual." This would protect the remit of the BBC Trust, which oversees standards, she said. She added: "There is public concern about government involvement threatening the independence of the BBC and there is, I believe, public support for the sort of proposal (of mutualisation) which would strengthen the Trust's hand in relation to the executive. "It would be absolutely clear the Trust is the cheerleader for the licence fee payer." Mutual companies do not have external shareholders but all members of the company are considered owners. Money is reinvested back into the company rather than paid out as dividends. The current royal charter allowing the BBC's licence fee expires at the end of 2016 and MPs have been discussing its future in a backbench debate. Conservative John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture Committee, said there had been some "very clear failures" by the BBC in the last 12 months, but added that it remained "one of the finest broadcasters in the world". Director-general Tony Hall and the chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, will appear before the committee on Tuesday to discuss the BBC's annual report. </body>

      <body>US comedian Carol Burnett has been honoured with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Dame Julie Andrews, Tony Bennett and Tina Fey were among those who performed in her honour at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Sunday. Burnett's variety show began in the 1960s and ran for 11 years, averaging 30 million viewers a week. "This is very encouraging... it was a long time in coming," Burnett joked as she accepted the prize. She added: "I understand because there are so many people funnier than I am, especially here in Washington. "With any luck, they'll soon get voted out, and I'll still have the Mark Twain Prize." Fey - creator and star of 30 Rock - applauded Burnett, 80, for opening doors for other female comedians. When Burnett first launched her own show, a TV executive told her the genre was "a man's game". "You mean so much to me," Fey said. "I love you in a way that is just shy of creepy," she joked. Burnett got her first break when she was talent-spotted by bookers for the Ed Sullivan Show. She then landed a role on Broadway and began to appear on The Garry Moore Show. This led to Burnett signing a 10-year contract with CBS to do guest slots on sitcoms and perform in one TV special a year. She launched the Carol Burnett Show in 1967, with guest stars including Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan. It won 22 Emmy awards. Burnett was best known for her "Tarzan" yell and for ending each show by tugging her ear, which was a personal message to her grandmother. Tim Conway, one of Burnett's co-stars on her show, joked that he now spends his time travelling around the US for Burnett to receive awards. "Thank you for being such a friend, such a generous person, not with salary, but generous." </body>

      <body>The UK Theatre Awards, which were handed out on Sunday, proved that top-class theatre can be found across the UK, despite warnings about the consequences of funding cuts. So is regional theatre in rude health or in crisis? Here, figures from the stage community assess the state of British theatre and look to the future. Sheffield Theatres led the winners at the UK Theatre Awards, with four prizes. The complex, which comprises three auditoria, was named the best theatre outside London by The Stage newspaper earlier this year. What is the mood in British theatre - doom and gloom or celebration? I'd be lying if I didn't say there was a measure of doom and gloom because we're all facing more and more cuts. However at the same time it's really important that we do celebrate the vibrancy, and that actually we're in rude health. What is your biggest challenge? Cuts. We pride ourselves on being an integral part [of the city]. We have a loyal audience and we want to keep putting on challenging, provoking stuff, as well as entertaining stuff. If we continue to get cut more and more then inevitably something has to give. Have cuts had any impact on what gets on stage? Of course. We have to look at how many new plays we can do a year. What are the risky plays we can do in the year? We want to continue doing experimental work - but at the same time we have to look at how we programme the larger spaces. Erica Whyman won a UK Theatre Award for best children's show for The Borrowers, her last show as artistic director of Northern Stage in Newcastle before moving to the RSC. Sum up the health of British theatre. British theatre is in a pretty healthy state, particularly artistically. Austere times can sometimes put a fire in one's belly and I think that's happened. There are some great new voices coming through. And there's a political bite to some of our work. At the same time, it's been a very tough year. What is the biggest challenge facing UK theatres? There is the economic challenge, both for audiences and theatres. The other challenge is that audiences' lives have changed. The award for The Borrowers is lovely because [we must] reach young people and make sure they have a passion for live theatre in a world where they're surrounded by screens. Give me the name of me one to watch - a talent you are excited about. Chris Thorpe is a writer, a director and a performer, and I think in some interesting way he's the future. He moves between those roles and he's writing very provocative and daring work. A collaborator of Chris's is Lucy Ellinson. She is also a performer, devising work, campaigning politically and she's also the future. There's a generation who don't see these hierarchical roles as any kind of barrier. They just make the work they want to make and they're intent on finding a new, really engaged audience. What is your biggest challenge? It's a big theatre and it's quite expensive to run so it's keeping the ability to take risks. Even a musical last year that [we thought] was a sure-fire hit suddenly wasn't, so you've got to keep your head above the water and be very clever with your programming. Was that Finding Neverland? No. I thought that was the risk. But the producer Harvey Weinstein helped us sell that well. Our Christmas show [Hello, Dolly!], which we thought would do well, didn't do as well. What do you learn from that? This Christmas we're doing Chicago and we're back on track. Clearly the public want sexy and new but familiar titles. Not old titles. If I did Oklahoma! we'd be empty. If they don't come this year, we will be in trouble. Tell me one to watch. A choreographer - Drew McOnie. He announced his own company last week, so he's following Matthew Bourne's footsteps. We're going to premiere his new dance piece called Drunk in the spring. What has gone down well at the Royal Exchange this year? What has struck a chord, which is encouraging, is serious plays that are very warm and passionate. Plays like Accrington Pals, To Kill A Mockingbird and All My Sons have really connected with our audiences. People seem to want warm, robust, humanistic dramas. Have funding cuts made any difference to your shows? No, we're absolutely determined not to let that happen. Obviously any theatre like ours depends a bit on how box office income is generated. So if we find that we can't quite generate enough box office income it will probably affect your programme choices at some point, but our attitude is always to make the most exciting, vivid work. Tell me one to watch. A director named Max Webster, who we found through the regional theatre directors' scheme. We offered him To Kill A Mockingbird, which he did a really good production of, and he's returning to our theatre to do Orlando with Suranne Jones. How would you sum up the health of theatre? It's pretty healthy, regional theatre. The glory of it is that it's healthy despite the fact we're under enormous pressure from local authority funding as well as central government etc. Everyone's redoubled their efforts and is working so hard. It's healthier than you would expect. What's the best thing you've seen this year? Blanche McIntyre just won the best director's award and we're working with her at ETT next year. I went to see her The Seagull in Derby on a Saturday night and took my 14-year-old daughter and it was amazing. Absolutely glorious in every way. That's regional theatre at its best. What has gone down well this year? Lots of people have done lots of comedy. There's a real sense of, 'People don't want to be challenged too much in these austere times so let's put on something light and frothy'. Maybe we might look at it as the year of - I don't want to say froth - but a light-hearted, light-touch approach. People have steered clear - I find myself tempted to do the same - of anything too depressing. Have you noticed any trends in theatre this year? I think there's a considerable growth in ambition and willingness to risk-take on major stages outside London. Regional theatres across the board have started to take more risk with a greater sense of localism in their larger spaces. What's your biggest challenge? As the resources grow tighter, it's very easy to do fewer things better, which then don't cover the year, or do more things worse. We're trying to hold the [quality] level that we demand of our own work, but also keep the theatre alive and thrumming during the course of the year. Tell me one to watch I'm very excited by David Ireland, a writer. He's ready to write some very big plays. Cora Bissett, a director, has started stepping up to bigger stages. Her work is so human, joyful, popular and profoundly political. What state is regional theatre in? I think there is and always has been a great deal of dynamism in the regions. We work a lot with new writing and presenting new stories in different ways to challenge audiences, particularly in rural settings. Now more than ever there's a need for making theatre accessible to as wide a group of people as possible outside urban conurbations. Why? We've been in recession and people are making choices, particularly with disposable income, and if we can take work to people in walking distance of where they live and involve wider communities then that strips one of the barriers to entry. What's your biggest challenge? We're funding a collaborative PhD with the University of Nottingham, where we're looking at challenging new forms of theatre for rural audiences. Rather than just touring safe work to rural locations we're looking at really how we can challenge and stretch audiences and not just play safe. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: The Voice winner Andrea Begley</title>
      <description>The Voice winner Andrea Begley lays out her ambitions</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24550545</url>
      <date>1382367394</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70521000/jpg/_70521916_03fd42a4-9138-4696-8987-03446d8cc948.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Andrea Begley only won the second series of The Voice in June, but her album is already finished. The 27-year-old says she wants to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor, Leanne Mitchell - who waited a year to release an album, only to see it stall at number 134 in the UK charts. The time constraints mean Begley's debut mostly consists of cover versions, with Bruce Springsteen's Dancing In The Dark and Jake Bugg's Lightning Bolt among the songs to receive an acoustic makeover. But Begley also sings two original songs, including the title track, The Message. The former law student, who has only 10% vision, talked to the BBC about recording her vocals "line by line"; will.i.am's protest at her victory on The Voice (he tweeted he was "sad" and "perplexed"); and how she would change the show next year. Has it been a rush to get your album ready? Obviously, we couldn't plan for what happened beyond the show, because nobody knew what the result was going to be - but I always had ideas in my head about things I'd like to do if I ever did an album. So we started with that kind of blank page and went from there. What we tried to do was get some stuff from the show, and also do covers of songs I have loved over the years. We knew it was important to get out an album before Christmas. Why was that? From the point of view of what happened last year: Everyone knows things didn't go quite as well as they might have done. Leaving the winner's album for so long, it didn't keep the momentum. For me, it was important to make a good job of it, but not take so long that people had forgotten about me. Do you think you got the balance right? Hopefully! I think the album captures different sides of me as an artist. Within the show I only really got to show a certain angle. What do you mean by that? I suppose what I mean is you've only got a certain number of performances, and you've got a time limit as well. I guess, for me, beyond the show it's great to show I can sing all kinds of things. How long was the time limit? It's quite short. One of them was 1 minute 10 seconds. You find ways and means around it. It's all in the edit - picking out the bits people like to listen to. But there's no doubt about it, you are under a constraint. It's nice to have the luxury of doing a full song on the album! Your audition song (Sarah McLachlan's Angel) is on the album. How far in advance did you decide to perform it on the show? Pretty much from the get-go. As soon as I met the production team, I said: 'This is the kind of song I'd like to do. It isn't too over-played, it isn't too well-known, but it suits my style and I can sing it very well.' I very much nailed my colours to the mast with that song - and it bore out in the end. It really worked. A lot of people, including will.i.am, said they were disappointed you beat Leah McFall. How did that make you feel? Music is subjective and everyone has their own opinion. You'll always get people who'll prefer my music to what Leah or Will are into. The thing is, I love all kinds of music. I love the stuff that Will does, so it was never case of me versus them. Will's tweet is very much in the past. He spoke to me afterwards and said 'look, it's just because I wanted my act to win, and I would have supported you if you'd been my act'. Some people suggested you won because you're visually impaired. Was that a shock? It's a little bit disappointing, I guess, if people go down the route of saying I only won because I had a story. That's not giving the public the credit it's due. People don't vote for those reasons - it's a singing show, at the end of the day, and I was there on the same basis as everyone else. I never, ever tried to make out that I was there because I was visually impaired. Did your law degree come in handy when you were reading your recording contract? [Laughs] It's always helpful, in the sense that it keeps your wits about you. But my experience was a long way off the world of showbusiness. How does singing in the studio compare to live performances? It's very different. Studio days are tiring because you're standing in front of a microphone for hours on end. People don't realise how meticulous it is. You record everything line by line by line by line. But then, when you hear it back, you realise how much you need to focus on each individual part to get it right. Your aunt is country singer Philomena Begley. Did she give you any tips? I've had quite a lot of contact with my aunt in the past couple of months, and she's been keeping me advised of songs, and things I should watch out for. She's very excited about the album coming out. There's a little bit of country on it, so she'll be happy with that. What did she tell you to watch out for? Just to make sure I get my opinions across. I'm always pretty determined anyway, and I speak my mind. So I definitely did that. What was the biggest argument you had? Did you have to pull a diva strop? Not yet - but I'm working on it. I want a newborn kitten in every dressing room! You played a concert with Evelyn Glennie for people with sensory disabilities in over the summer. What was that like? It was done in conjunction with the RNIB and Action for Hearing Loss. My set was made accessible to people with hearing loss by having sign interpreters there, so I just had to make sure I stuck to the set list and did all the lyrics in the correct order! It's easy to assume that people with hearing loss wouldn't get anything from a concert, but I guess there's a visceral, physical element to live music. Of course, and obviously you've got all the visual aspects of watching the band. If you've got some level of hearing, you can pick up some of the concert and enjoy it. It's the same for me if I go to see a film. I won't necessarily get all the visuals, but it's still an experience - going out to the cinema and the big screen, and all that. Has going to the cinema become more accessible with things like audio description? It's definitely improving, although audio description is nowhere near the level I think it should be. Someone asked me recently what I felt was the single biggest problem for people with visual impairment. From my point of view, I'd like to get people to understand what visual impairment is, so that if they come across someone with a stick or a dog, that they know not to freak out or ask silly questions. Does that happen a lot? I run into it very rarely, but you do get it sometimes. People have come up and shouted loudly at me. They must have thought my ears didn't work, as well as my eyes! Finally - what do you think of the new line-up on The Voice? I'm excited. It's good to give it a fresh look. I know some people think Danny and Jessie leaving might be a little too much disruption. But the new setting will keep viewers' interest alive. Everybody wants to see what kind of banter there'll be between the new coaches. If you were auditioning this year, whose team would you want to be on? I don't know! Possibly Tom, or Kylie. I think will.i.am's going to have a lot of competition from her. She has a sparkle and personality that'll be really good for the show. And if they put you in charge, what would you change? For me, definitely, the knock-out rounds were absolutely horrendous. So I'd make them do two knock-out rounds, just to be a little bit devious. You'd make it harder! I'd just like to fully test them. See if they're up to the challenge. Andrea Begley's album, The Message, is out on Monday, 21 October. </body>

      <title>Saving Mr Banks: the critics' view</title>
      <description>The critics' views of the London Film Festival's closing movie</description>

      <body>Emma Thompson plays Mary Poppins creator PL Travers in Saving Mr Banks, which closed the London Film Festival on Sunday. It co-stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, in the story of Disney's long battle to buy the rights to the much-loved book, which was eventually turned into a musical starring Julie Andrews in 1964. Directed by The Blind Side's John Lee Hancock, the film takes us back into Travers' troubled childhood using frequent flashbacks to the Australian outback where she grew up. Saving Mr Banks is released on 29 November, but here is what the critics have been making of it: Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers, in a mesmerising and droll performance. Tom Hanks takes on the role of Disney, with a nailbrush moustache and unexpectedly gentle charm, his upbeat American optimism making Mrs Travers fit to burst with outrage in her buttoned-up tweed suit. Disney's relentlessly cheerful campaign to charm her is a delight to watch, as is our knowing take on lines such as 'Dick Van Dyke? A horrid idea'. In all a charming comedy. Apart from the dancing penguins of course, which Mrs Travers loathed. Read the full review here (subscription). The film is effective enough as a weepie. It boasts a fine performance from Thompson, who starts the movie in eccentric groove like a prickly version of Joyce Grenfell's Miss Gossage, but slowly and subtly reveals her character's vulnerabilities and complexities. However, Saving Mr. Banks also feels sanitised and disingenuous. Although the idea was initially developed by BBC Films, this is the Disney version of how Disney made Mary Poppins. Saving Mr. Banks is more a character study than a behind-the-scenes drama. Travers' character is rich and complex. The problem is that Hanks's Disney seems like a whitewash. Read the full review here. An enormous spoonful of sugar and the tiniest bit of medicine: it all goes down, just about. This is a warmly, in fact outrageously sentimental and self-congratulatory film from Disney about the master himself. Only a Disney film would have had the rights to the Mary Poppins clips and only a Disney film would have been permitted the possible lese-majesty of representing the great man on screen. Saving Mr Banks is an indulgent, overlong picture which is always on the verge of becoming a mess. Thankfully, reliable old Tom Hanks snaps his fingers and - spit, spot - everything more or less gets cleared away. Read the full review here. This clash (between Travers and Disney), with some of the real-life antagonism glossed over, has been reworked into a cat-and-mouse game that often resembles a seduction. Obviously, this gets played for laughs - many of them good ones. No opportunity is lost to highlight the differences in world-view between these two. But it's Thompson as the heroically unbiddable Travers who makes the most of it; her bravura performance effectively dominates the film. Pitching her delivery somewhere between Nanny McPhee and Miss Jean Brodie, Thompson perfectly embodies Travers's air of disapproval and distaste. Read the full review here . Somewhere, Uncle Walt is smiling. Thick with affection for Hollywood's most literal "dream factory" and wry in its depiction of the studio filmmaking process, director John Lee Hancock's (film) should earn far more than tuppence from holiday audiences - and from awards voters who can scarcely resist this sort of mash note to the magic of movies (eg Argo, The Artist). If 2007's Enchanted remains undisputed as the great, impish, postmodern riff on Disney iconography, Saving Mr Banks is the unapologetically retro valentine Disney himself might have made. It's a bit square, never particularly surprising, yet very rich in its sense of creative people and their spirit of self-reinvention - the Outback girl refashioned as a prim and proper British lady, the Missouri farm boy who turned himself into a cross between Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz. Read the full review here. In a part once mooted for Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson takes charge of the central role of the waspish PL Travers with an authority that makes you wonder how anybody else could ever have been considered. The twinkly-eyed, avuncular figure incarnated by a mustachioed Hanks - who only for a fleeting moment shows off a glower worthy of a mafia crime boss ordering a hit - couldn't be further from the negative analyses of Disney depicted in, say, Richard Schickel's scathing biography The Disney Version or the recent Philip Glass opera The Perfect American. Some will no doubt call this a whitewash, but Saving Mr. Banks presents a grittier version of Disney than one might have expected 10 or even five years ago... Heck, they even show him smoking, and that's way worse than being an FBI informant these days. Read the full review here. </body>

      <description>The Mary Poppins sequel that never was</description>

      <body>Brian Sibley is one of writing's multi-hyphenates. He is a prolific and award-winning writer of radio drama, such as Radio 4's acclaimed Lord of the Rings adaptations. He has written plays of his own and many books focusing on film. The subjects of his biographies range from CS Lewis to Mickey Mouse. In fact, a love of Disney has been central since childhood. At home his walls are plastered with Disney artwork. "In the 1980s, it was exciting to be flown over to LA to sit in script conferences at Disney, working on what looked like a marvellous project - the studio's second Poppins movie." Though the screenplay he wrote with PL Travers was never made, he looks back on the experience fondly. And he's in a unique position to explain what she really thought about the 1964 film. "I first corresponded with Pamela Travers in the 1970s, when I was writing a book about Walt Disney. I didn't get to meet her for a decade but when finally we met it quickly became a friendship. "Since she died, Pamela's been painted as an old dragon but it's not true: I'd go round for tea on a Sunday and she was great company. Writing with her turned out to be an eccentric experience but that was because she remained proprietorial about Mary Poppins. "But why shouldn't she be? - it was her creation. Though Pamela, who was very spiritual, would probably have said that the character had been given to her." The first Poppins film had been a massive hit. "But in some ways it's quite a loose adaptation, " Brian Sibley says. "Her books were really collections of free-standing short stories. The first film used elements both of the original Mary Poppins book (published 1934) and the second one, Mary Poppins Comes Back. "The Disney studio had been very keen to make a sequel but Pamela always said no. One Sunday we were having tea when she mentioned they'd been in contact. She described the latest idea to me and said she was about to reject it." "I said it was a pity there couldn't be a new film - so many people had loved the Mary Poppins character. Pamela said 'Oh I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.' And she paused. 'If it were you dear that would be different." "So I wrote a letter to Roy Disney (Walt's nephew, by now in charge) who I had met a few times. This was the 1980s and people still wrote letters. I told him there might be a chance of making the film. After a couple of days I got news Roy was sending someone to London to talk to me. Within a fortnight we were working on an outline." The project was Mary Poppins Comes Back, based on those parts of Travers' second book unused in 1964. Disney contracted Sibley and Travers to supply a treatment which they then set to work to expand. "For months I would sit and talk with Pamela at her home in Chelsea about the ideas I had. Then she would give me notes on what Mary Poppins would or would not do and think. She was very particular, even down to how a line should be said. I recorded her on tape and went away. Of course I then wrote what I needed to write - but I always bore her comments in mind. I would give her my script pages and she would write notes all over it. Some parts came back with 'no No NO!' scrawled all over the page. But she also said when she liked what I'd written." Sibley thinks they managed to find a balance between what Travers had written in her books and what the Poppins character then became in the film. But he also sensed a cloud looming over the movie's chances of getting made - the thorny issue of casting. "It was more than twenty years since the original so who could play Mary? Julie Andrews was no longer in her twenties and she had moved a long way from the My Fair Lady - Sound of Music stage of her career. Disney made an approach but it came to nothing. And who could ever have played Mary Poppins half as well?" Casting the world's most famous nanny was not the only quandary. "In our screenplay there was no longer a Bert (as played by Dick van Dyke). Instead there was Bert's brother, who had a similar function of being Mary's friend and possible admirer. Finding a Bert replacement was almost as tricky as re-casting the lead role. "I remember sitting in a restaurant on Rodeo Drive listening to an executive explain they thought Michael Jackson might be right for the part. Bear in mind this was an ice-cream seller in a park in Edwardian London. Or maybe it would have worked - who knows?" And contrary to popular belief, Sibley insists it's untrue that PL Travers hated the original film. "She may have mellowed in her views by the time I knew her but she knew there were good things in it. When we got down to work I thought it would be a good idea if we watched the original film first so I arranged a private screening. "I asked Pamela how long it was since she'd seen Poppins - this was the mid-1980s. She said 'Well not since the premiere, obviously'. I was astonished she hadn't seen this hugely famous film for more than twenty years. But Pamela didn't have a video or even a TV set. "Throughout the film she gave me notes. There were one or two moments where she said 'Oh that's terrible'. But there were more where she got excited at what was up there on screen. She patted my hand and said 'Oh we must remember that, that's excellent, I like that bit very much...' And that's how we began to build our screenplay." Eventually the sequel fell victim to a combination of inherent casting problems and the fact that new executives were running Disney. "But I treasured my time working with PL Travers," Sibley says. "And we stayed in touch almost until she died. She was demanding as a friend. But she had great wisdom and great knowledge of so many things: literature, life, love, faith. She was prickly and difficult at times. But she was also someone of a towering intellect whose friendship I really valued." </body>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <title>Gatland names three uncapped players</title>

      <body>Warren Gatland has named three uncapped players in Wales' autumn 2013 squad. They are Scarlets scrum-half Rhodri Williams, Cardiff Blues centre Cory Allen and Ospreys wing Eli Walker. Perpignan utility back James Hook and lock team-mate Luke Charteris return along with Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland. Jamie Roberts (ankle) is injured and Alex Cuthbert is out after suffering a leg injury in the Blues' Heineken Cup win over Toulon at the weekend. In-from Scarlet Scott Williams is tipped to fill that centre spot alongside Jonathan Davies while Walker's chances of a Test debut are boosted by British and Irish Lion Cuthbert's absence. Blues centre Owen Williams and fly-half Rhys Patchell stay involved at senior level having been among a host of fresh faces who drew their June Test series in Japan 1-1. Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips also remains, having toured Japan. Phillips' former Parc y Scarlets hooking rival, Matthew Rees, is out of contention as he is scheduled to undergo testicular surgery that has forced him to take time out from the game. Ospreys tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis returns after recovering from a knee injury suffered during Wales' 2012 autumn series. Walker was named in Wales' 2013 Six Nations squad, but injuries forced him out and he also missed the trip to Japan. Blues centre Allen comes in after impressive early-season form, including a fine performance in their triumph over European champions Toulon. An unexpected consideration for Gatland was Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips having to go in front of the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations that he attended a video analysis session while under the influence of alcohol. If found guilty, the player could face a club suspension and fine, but that would not affect Phillips' Wales availability. However, the emergence of former Wales Under-20 scrum-half Williams is a big plus. The Ammanford product has won selection for Scarlets' Heineken Cup matches against Harlequins and Racing Metro ahead of two other promising number nines, Gareth Davies and Aled Davies. Wales' series kicks off against South Africa on 9 November, continuing against Argentina on 16 November, Tonga the following Friday, and against Australia eight days later on 30 November. Gatland said: "We have an important campaign ahead as we look to test ourselves against some of the best sides in the world but also add strength in depth to our squad as we look to the future. "We face a huge game against South Africa first up and they will be coming to us after an impressive Rugby Championship campaign. "Recent matches between us have been very close and physical and that will be a great test for us to kick-off. "All four matches will be a stern test but we are looking forward to the challenge and looking forward to seeing what we can do on this stage. "The Rugby World Cup is less than two years away, so we are looking to build as much depth in our squad as possible and to give vital international experience to our players." South Africa announce their squad on Monday, 28 October. Forwards: Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Adam Jones (Ospreys), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Paul James (Bath), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Bevington (Ospreys), Richard Hibbard (Ospreys), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Luke Charteris (Perpignan), Ian Evans (Ospreys), Bradley Davies (Cardiff Blues), Andrew Coombs (Dragons), Ryan Jones (Ospreys), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), Toby Faletau (Dragons), Dan Lydiate (Racing Metro). Backs: Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Bayonne), Lloyd Williams (Cardiff Blues), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Patchell (Cardiff Blues), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Jon Davies (Scarlets), Ashley Beck (Ospreys), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Owen Williams (Cardiff Blues), James Hook (Perpignan), George North (Northampton Saints), Eli Walker (Ospreys), Leigh Halfpenny (Cardiff Blues), Liam Williams (Scarlets). </body>

      <body>French travellers blocking health workers from parking at a hospital say they will stay another day despite a request to leave the staff car park. NHS officials have written to the travellers asking them to move the 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The hospital has been seeking legal advice to try and move the vehicles. The travellers arrived late Saturday afternoon and moved on to the 300-space car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." </body>

      <body>Police are hunting two masked men who burst into a house on Anglesey, assaulted two people and stole cash. Two men in their 30s were taken to hospital in Bangor but their injuries are not thought to be serious. The incident happened on Friday 18 October at a property in St Catherine's Close, Llanfaes near Beaumaris on Anglesey. Det Con Chris Burrow said he remained hopeful the masked pair would be identified. "During the course of the incident the offenders stole an amount of cash," he said. "We are hoping to obtain a full description of the offenders in due course but we believe they were wearing some sort of face masks. "Over the last 12 months we have seen a steady decrease in crimes of violence and with the continued support and vigilance from the local community I'm sure we can quickly identify those responsible." Witnesses should call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <body>A school is likely to remain closed for the rest of the week after ceiling damage, probably caused by heavy rain. The Grade II-listed Albert Road Primary in Penarth closed after loose plaster was found on two ceilings. Vale of Glamorgan council said the damage, thought to be the result of a water leak, was spotted on Monday. About 385 children attend the school, with another 72 in the nursery. The council said the ceilings would have to be made safe before re-opening. Councillor Chris Elmore, cabinet member for children's services, said: "Our officers think the damage has been the result of a water leak, probably caused by the extremely heavy rain we had over the weekend. "The damaged ceilings are over two halls, which lead to the classrooms. "My priority is the safety of the children and staff, so unfortunately we have to close the school while we make the ceilings safe. "We apologise to parents for the inconvenience and I will make sure our officers do everything they can to have the school open again as soon as possible." Parents have been told the school will probably remain closed this week, while next week is the half-term holiday. It said there is "no issue" with asbestos in the ceilings. The Victorian-era building closed temporarily for repairs last year. In December 2012, the school was closed down for emergency repairs to pipe work which required the floors being lifted up. </body>

      <body>Cardiff Blues captain Matthew Rees is to undergo testicular surgery. The region say the 32-year-old former Wales skipper, capped 58 times by his country, will have "an enforced spell away from rugby" as a result. The ex-British and Irish Lions hooker, who joined Blues from Scarlets in the summer, will initially miss Friday's RaboDirect Pro12 trip to Ulster. "Cardiff Blues would like to take this opportunity to wish Matthew a speedy recovery," a statement said. "And we look forward to seeing him back in action in the future. "The region will be making no further comment and would ask that the media respect Matthew's privacy at this time." Tonyrefail-born Rees was a late withdrawal from the Blues team ahead of their 19-15 Heineken Cup win over Toulon on Saturday. He played 182 times for the Scarlets after joining the region in the 2004-05 season and was famously part of the all-Welsh front row, along with props Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones, for the three Lions Tests against South Africa in June 2009. Rees previously played for Treorchy, Pontypridd and the now defunct Celtic Warriors and became Wales' 128th captain when given the role against Australia in November 2010. But he struggled to hold down a first-team place at Parc y Scarlets after missing out on Wales' World Cup campaign in 2011 through injury and departed for Cardiff at the end of last season. </body>

      <body>Urgent work is being carried out to unblock a river in a small village on Gower to prevent it being cut off by rising water. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has started removing sand from a channel in Oxwich to restore the flow of water. It comes as rivers across south, west and mid Wales were put on alert for flooding following heavy rain. NRW issued 13 flood alerts for rivers including the Usk in Monmouthshire across to the Towy in Carmarthenshire. A team of engineers is at the scene in Oxwich with a digger to remove the sand, which has blown in from the beach and is blocking the flow of water from a channel running through wetlands into the sea. NRW said the stream was backing up and threatening to cut off the village. They were expecting to break through the blockage by lunchtime, a spokesperson added. Nick Edwards, senior reserves manager at NRW, said: "The water that flows down from the marsh has been blocked by the large amount of sand that's been deposited by the high tides recently. "If we didn't do this then in 72 hours, I imagine, the road will be flooded." There were reports of surface water flooding in Dunvant, Swansea, and in Pembroke overnight. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning of further heavy rain for south and west Wales on Tuesday. The B4296 at Dunvant Square near Brynaeron in Swansea was affected by surface water, although Mid and West Wales Fire Service said they had not received any calls from the area. Further west, staff at the Field Studies Centre in Orielton, south of Pembroke in Pembrokeshire, reported seeing flooding near their base, including damage to some cars. A BBC weather presenter said more rainfall through the morning could lead to some localised flooding across south Wales, although the rain was expected to turn to showers in the afternoon. She added there was unlikely to be widespread flooding but surface water flooding could be a problem. Looking ahead, there were concerns that further heavy rainfall on Thursday could raise the risk again, with an early warning in place for south and west Wales. </body>

      <description>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, it emerges.</description>

      <body>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged. While most tenders for work are put out to everyone, ministers in Cardiff have adopted a UK government process to evaluate certain schemes. Only one company from Wales is registered to bid. The Welsh government said the process provided value for money. Only one company from Wales is registered with the department responsible in London, which means the others have been unable to bid for more than Â£800,000 worth of contracts, including a review of the Welsh government's flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme. Another research project involved assessing a Welsh government initiative to increase the amount of goods and services public bodies bought from Welsh companies. The Welsh government says between 80% and 90% of its tenders are open to all. A spokesperson said: "We are committed to encouraging Welsh businesses and higher education institutions to benefit from public sector contracts. We purchase the majority of our research via open tender or via our own procurement framework which does include a number of Welsh businesses. "We occasionally make use of the procurement framework operated by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) which provides good value for money." It said several Welsh organisations had been brought in as sub-contractors. Organisations such as the consultancies, Iaith and Oldbell 3, and the Cardiff Business School have been involved in some projects. The information emerged following freedom of information requests by Plaid Cymru. The party accuses the Welsh government of failing to "practise what it preaches" by allowing some businesses to be "cut out" of some contracts. North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd dismissed the claim that much of the work was sub-contracted back to Wales. "They take their top slice, they pocket that and they sub-contract Welsh companies to actually deliver large parts of the work , but at a fraction of the cost," he said. "So the key issue here is that the Welsh economy is in effect a leaking bucket. "There's a hole in the Welsh economy with all this potential money for Welsh businesses flowing out of Wales. We need to plug that leak." Iestyn Davies, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Cymru, said: "The government spends significant money through small businesses and large companies and it's important that the value is felt in the communities where those businesses are based. "When you spend money outside of Wales, that money's lost to Wales. "It's a very simple equation. "So good public sector procurement can leave a long-lasting value and legacy within communities. It doesn't matter how big the contract is, it can still have a real impact on a small local business." </body>

      <description>Forces veterans struggling with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder are being put at risk from a therapy used by a charity, BBC finds.</description>

      <body>Armed forces veterans struggling with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder are being put at risk from a therapy used by a Welsh charity, a BBC investigation has found. Healing the Wounds in Porthcawl has been asked to stop using Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). The therapy is not regulated or approved and can make patients worse. But Healing the Wounds said it is gathering data to prove its treatment is effective. Dr Neil Kitchiner, head of the NHS All Wales Veterans Health and Wellbeing service, told the BBC's Week In Week Out programme, which sent a Falklands veteran undercover to see what is being offered, that he has not seen evidence of the treatment working. "None of them are cured as far as I've seen, after three days treatment," he said. "Some have been made very unwell as a result of going there and have needed a lot of support from NHS and veterans' charities. "We have asked them to stop it. "We have shown the evidence from the NHS and from the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, we've shared our concerns with them and yet they continue to operate in the way they do." Healing The Wounds was set up by Bridgend couple Kevin and Carol Richards and has raised almost Â£500,000 in the last three years. They insist it is offering a safe and effective alternative therapy for veterans. But on the programme some describe feeling even worse after a three-day residential course during which veterans are sent to a hotel overnight. One veteran, who did not want to be identified, said the course of therapy left him feeling suicidal. "I did two full days and on the third I left and my wife came to collect me," he said. "When she came through the doors it was such a relief, I was left feeling worse than when I first went into Healing The Wounds." The undercover veteran, who does not have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but described suffering some of the symptoms, was told by Carol Richards during therapy that it had taken her just 20 minutes to help one soldier who had seen many of his colleagues killed. No attempt was made to contact the undercover veteran's GP to check his physical or mental health before therapy began. Prof Neil Greenberg, co-director of the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health at Kings College London, said: "If this group who are not medically qualified and don't know a person's whole treatment history, because they haven't got that, that could cause some real problems, it could be quite dangerous." Healing the Wounds said it is collecting data to prove its treatment is effective, but Prof Greenberg says unless NLP is subjected to what are known as randomised clinical trials it cannot be established as an appropriate treatment for PTSD. He added: "NLP has not been investigated by proper scientific trials to show it works. "The key point is, just because someone feels good at end session, there is no guarantee they're going to feel good in the future. "And given the fact we know psychological therapies have potential to harm we need to do those trails." The programme also discovered that regulators have investigated the qualifications of a counsellor who had falsely been described as a clinical psychologist and a paramedic while helping vulnerable veterans for the charity. John Yandle from Blaenavon claims Healing The Wounds did not check his qualifications before he began counselling people with PTSD who had turned to it for help. The Health and Care Professions Council which polices the appropriate use of job titles including paramedic and clinical psychologist has ordered him not to use the titles in future. Mr Yandle, who does have counselling qualifications, denied deliberately misleading people and says the charity had mistakenly referred to him as a paramedic on its website. Darren Millar, chair of the Welsh assembly's cross-party group on the Armed Forces, is calling for better regulation of charities offering mental health services to veterans. He said: "Because there is no regulation anybody can set up as an NLP practitioner and the quality of their work is not monitored by anybody so that puts potential risks out in the field for anybody accessing those sorts of services." "What we need is some proper arrangements for oversight of the quality of the work being done by any charity that is giving some support to veterans. "What is important is to measure the outcomes when any organisation is offering this sort of service to see if it is making a real difference in the lives of the people who contact it." The Charities Commission has confirmed it is investigating Healing the Wounds and its links to The Forces Aid Foundation - set up by Kevin Richards and wrongly described as a charity on its website. Mr Richards thanked the programme for pointing out the error and said it would amend its website. The Welsh government said it has spent Â£500,000 on the All Wales Veterans Health and Well Being Service. A spokesman added: "We are clear that where any body offers treatment for any condition, they should ensure that these are in line with evidence based guidelines. "This is a stipulation for the NHS but an expectation for general good practice more broadly." Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales on Tuesday, 22 October 2013 at 22:35 BST </body>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to a rugby player who has died suddenly aged 33. Father-of-two Stuart Williams, who played for Pontypridd RFC, was taken ill at work, Craig yr Hesg Quarry, on Monday and later died, the club said. Pontypridd RFC finance director Peter Howells described the prop forward as a "fine man on and off the pitch" who appeared well days before he died. Mr Williams, from Glyncoch, was married to Vicky and the couple had two young children, Harvey and Megan. The club said Mr Williams had a "real physical presence" in the front row. "I was with him on Saturday night, he wasn't unwell. Devastated is not the word," Mr Howells said. A statement on the club's website described Mr Williams as popular and loyal. "The club is today devastated by the news of Stuart's passing, and all thoughts now turn in deepest sympathy to his young family in their time of grief," it read. 'Devastating news' "Stuart was a popular character around the club, one who gave his all as a hard-grafting prop forward on the pitch, a long serving and loyal member of the squad. Mr Williams represented his local club at youth level before moving to Pontypridd. He graduated through the ranks and joined Rhymney in 2000. Following a spell with Cilfynydd, Mr Williams became a regular member of the Pontypridd senior squad. </body>

      <description>Five million pounds of lottery cash is on offer for a pilot project to improve the lives of young people in care.</description>

      <body>Five million pounds of lottery cash is on offer for a pilot project to improve the lives of young people in care. Almost 6,000 children in Wales are in care - 20% more than five years ago. The Big Lottery Fund has commissioned a study into finding new ways of ensuring youngsters receive quality care and can prosper later in life. Researchers have been asked to develop two proposals for schemes to tackle problems in education, employment, crime and mental health. "This is an important study and we want to make sure that we take on board existing learning whilst building on good practices and embracing innovation where it is based on sound evidence," said Big Lottery Fund Wales chair Sir Adrian Webb. "Children and young people in care are an especially vulnerable group as they often experience multiple and complex transitions. "For example, they may change foster carers or care home frequently, particularly if they have complex emotional and psychological needs that are not being addressed properly." He added: "This is a golden opportunity for organisations out there on the ground to work together to tackle this issue. "They have a real opportunity here to potentially make a real, positive difference to the lives of children and young people in care in Wales." The fund pointed to research indicating that children in care are more likely than the average child to suffer poor school achievement, mental health problems, involvement in crime, substance misuse, unemployment and homelessness. A high proportion of the prison population has also experienced or been through the care system, the fund said. 'Success stories' Despite the grim reading, the fund said some children do well and that its project will try to ensure that all looked-after children in Wales have vital support to overcome the challenges they face. The local authority areas most affected are said to be Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Cardiff and Neath Port Talbot while the least affected were Anglesey, Monmouthshire and Ceredigion. The Big Lottery Fund has named charity Children in Wales as the lead partner in the research working with experts from Cardiff University's school of social sciences and Swansea University. Sean O'Neill, policy director for Children in Wales, said: "There are many success stories to celebrate... yet the figures show that many children in care do not succeed as well as we would wish.

      <body>A group of five Syrian musicians has been forced to pull out of a major world music event in Cardiff after they were refused entry to the UK. Ensemble Al-Kindi were due to appear at the Womex showcase and trade fair running from Wednesday to Sunday. But the Home Office refused to issue visas amid doubts that the musicians would leave the UK after performing. Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan condemned what he called a "disgraceful and mean-spirited decision". The musicians had been due to appear in the Wales Millennium Centre's Donald Gordon Theatre on Thursday. Immigration minister Mark Harper confirmed in a letter to Mr Brennan that the musicians were refused entry clearance to perform after the group's management company provided insufficient evidence that they were able to finance the tour. The minister said the group had also been unable to provide evidence that they intended to leave the UK on completion of their stay, and that "it was not possible to accept their previous travel history, onward travel plans and possession of a valid Schengen visa as evidence that they had intention to leave the UK". Mr Harper added: "I appreciate the decision to refuse the applications is disappointing particularly as the event has been endorsed by the Welsh government." Mr Brennan said: "This is a disgraceful and mean-spirited decision by the Immigration Minister which does damage to the UK's cultural reputation and places a cloud over what is a wonderful celebration of world music being held in Cardiff. "What makes it worse is that there is ample evidence of this group's previous travel history and future touring plans. The UK government should be ashamed." Womex said in a statement on Monday: "Cerdd Cymru: Music Wales, the hosts of this year's Womex in Cardiff, and the Womex team have been working with the appropriate authorities at the highest level to appeal the decision, but have received confirmation this morning that the decision has not changed. "Sadly therefore, Ensemble Al-Kindi from Syria will not perform at WOMEX 13, Cardiff." Up to 60 concerts featuring more than 300 artists will be held at the Wales Millennium Centre, with a trade fair taking place at Cardiff Motorpoint Arena. The former Catatonia singer Cerys Matthews is the artistic director of Womex and is set to perform at the grand opening. </body>

      <body>Former Middlesex and Sussex batsman Toby Radford has been appointed head coach of Glamorgan. Caerphilly-born Radford takes over from Australian Matthew Mott, who was in charge at the club for three seasons. Radford, 41, is currently assistant coach and specialist batting coach with the West Indies. "He is a proud Welshman and is looking forward to working with our players and nurturing local talent," said incoming chief executive Hugh Morris. "Toby has built a strong reputation as one of the most talented young cricket coaches in England and Wales, and his experience of managing and developing some world-class cricketers will be a great asset to our club." Radford emerged as a potential replacement for Mott in August after former England Test players Robert Croft and Steve Watkin had both confirmed they were interested in the role. Radford was part of the coaching team which guided the West Indies to victory in the ICC World T20 in Sri Lanka in 2012. He also had a hand in establishment of the the West Indian Cricket Academy and led Middlesex to the domestic Twenty20 title in 2008. "I look forward to working with Hugh Morris and the playing and coaching staff of Glamorgan in bringing success back to the county I supported as a youngster," said Radford. "It was great to see the team reaching a Lord's final at the end of the season, and I believe we have a wonderful opportunity of building on this success and developing a team of which the Welsh nation can be proud." Glamorgan were beaten by Nottinghamshire in the final of the YB40 on 21 September. It was the Welsh county's first appearance in a domestic final Lord's final in 13 years. </body>

      <title>Housing concerns for Wylfa workers</title>
      <description>Talks are taking place about how to ensure adequate housing for workers set to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey.</description>

      <body>Talks will take place about how to ensure adequate housing for workers set to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey. The island's council said if the Â£8bn Wylfa B project went ahead, an extra 3,500 people would need somewhere to live while it was being built. A third would stay in private rented property while others would buy new homes or use tourist houses, it said. But there is a fear of price increases, making it harder for locals to buy. Wylfa B forms part of the nuclear project Horizon which also includes proposals for a new nuclear power station at Oldbury, in South Gloucestershire. Japanese company Hitachi bought Horizon for Â£700m a year ago after the two German companies behind the project - E.ON and RWE - announced they were pulling out. Next year Horizon will hold a first phase of formal public consultation, with plans for initial site work to begin from 2015. Major on-site work would start in 2018 with the first electricity being generated by the mid-2020s. New houses are already being built on Anglesey - such as at Benllech - but Shan Williams, the council's head of housing services, said plans for homes for the nuclear project workers were still at an early stage. "We will need to have more information from the developers," she said. "We will be doing some work with private sector landlords and starting to build additional affordable housing on the island." Many people on the island say local people need to come first whether it is for new homes, new jobs or the new power station. But Anglesey council admitted it had to plan for a situation where workers came in from outside to avoid being caught off guard. The island's assembly member, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was something which needed to be carefully managed and that many of the jobs that came up needed to be kept "as local as possible". He added: "With the building phase, let's make sure that it brings money into the island but it doesn't leave us with a housing crisis - and there is a potential for that." Dafydd Hardy, an estate agent working in Gwynedd and Anglesey, said the island was not seeing a house price boom yet. But he agreed that it was a situation that needed to be handled carefully, because a housing boom meant homes would be harder for local people to afford. "Any estate agent would agree with that, they don't want that," he said. "They want sustainability in the market. "I think there is a concern with regards to protecting the prices for the local people because they need to have affordability and we don't want to see them priced out of the market." One thing that officials had hoped could help was a proposed massive leisure park in Holyhead. Developer Land and Lakes said the 800 holiday lodges and cottages could be used temporarily by Wylfa B construction workers. But the plans were turned down earlier this month although that decision still has to be finalised in the next few weeks. </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock Â£2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for Â£2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced Â£62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around Â£1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <description>A Â£4.3m pedestrian and cycle bridge across Rhyl harbour is being officially opened.</description>

      <body>A Â£4.3m pedestrian and cycle bridge across Rhyl harbour is being officially opened. Pont y Ddraig (Dragon's Bridge) provides the final link in 15 miles (24km) of traffic-free cycling across Conwy and Denbighshire. It was named by Rhyl pupil Leon Jones, following a schools competition, and local children are being invited to the opening. Work was delayed earlier this year after cables were stolen from the site. About 200m (656ft) of cable was stolen in April from the bridge, which boasts a 45m-high (about 148ft) mast. There are two sections of deck which lift up, with the underside lit up with lights that change from green to red and back. It provides a traffic-free alternative route to the nearby Blue Bridge, which Sustrans Wales said was very congested and deterred cyclists and walkers from using it. Pont-y-Ddraig now also forms part of a long-distance cycle route across the north Wales coast. Jane Lorimer, director of Sustrans Wales, which partly financed the bridge, said this one one of 10 schemes in Wales which was bringing investment to the local area. "Here in Rhyl the bridge is very much part of a regeneration scheme which is opening up an extension along Rhyl seafront and really putting this area, which is an area of deprivation, into the limelight as a place which is a joy to visit in its own right. "It's unlocked the whole of the harbour areas. There has been additional investment and there will be a visitor centre and public squares. "It's really about creating a destination where people can come and enjoy their time, spend money and get out and about." </body>

      <body>Dean Keates scored his second goal in two games as Wrexham beat struggling Woking in the Conference Premier. Keates received the ball from Jay Harris's short corner and his cross into the area deceived everyone to beat Sam Beasant. Woking rallied in the second half with Mike Cestor's header striking the crossbar and Andy Coughlin denying Scott Rendell. Joe Clarke sealed the win in the final minute with a composed finish. Victory extended Wrexham's unbeaten run to three games but Woking remain in the Conference Premier's bottom four. Wrexham player-manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales: "With all the problems we've had with centre-backs and the week we've had, to have a clean-sheet and win the game is really pleasing. "[In the] first half we were good, deserved our lead and I think in the game we probably had the better chances. But in the second half we stopped doing what we were doing in the first half. "A win's a win. That's what we said before [the game] - by hook or by crook we need to get three points to get us up this league." Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: "We look at today's defeat as self-inflicted. I felt in the first twenty minutes we were in control and they were very low confidence. "I was fully aware that they were struggling but their goalkeeper made some very important saves. "I was probably more disappointed from the time that they scored the goal, which seemed to give them a lift and I felt that we never did enough today. "We didn't contribute enough and there were some choice words at half-time. "I think we looked more with it in the second-half. And I ask my players why didn't we hurt them enough." </body>

      <title>Hospitals plan to axe non-urgent ops</title>
      <description>Health chiefs plan to halt some non-urgent surgery at four general hospitals in mid and west Wales to cope with winter pressures.</description>

      <body>Health chiefs plan to halt some non-urgent surgery at four major hospitals in mid and west Wales over the winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said it would not carry out some elective orthopaedic operations like hip and knee replacements while it dealt with increased pressure on services. Hospitals in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth are affected. The health service union Unison criticised the move saying it would result in longer delays for patients. The health board said if the plans were backed it would review its proposals at the West Wales General, Withybush, Prince Philip, Llanelli and Bronglais, Aberystwyth hospitals "towards the end of the winter surge". But Unison claims the board is cancelling all non-urgent orthopaedic surgery until April 2014. Dr Phil Kloer, director of clinical services at Hywel Dda, told BBC Wales that emergency cases and people already booked for elective orthopaedic surgery would not be affected, but the four hospitals would take no new elective surgeries from November. Earlier, he said: "In past years, there have been too many operations cancelled at the last minute due to emergency admissions. "In previous winters, we had up to 160 additional beds in place often being managed by temporary staff. This is not a position we can sustain this year." "To address this, we propose to manage our bed stock and elective surgical lists in a better way during the busiest months this winter to ensure we have the staff capacity to manage emergencies and the most urgent patients. "We would like to reassure patients that if they have an urgent clinical need they will be seen. Emergency and cancer procedures, the vast majority of orthopaedic day surgery and other elective procedures will also continue." The health board said people on a waiting list for surgery who had not been given a date for their operation might be offered another form of treatment or day surgery, depending on how urgent their situation was. Unison branch chairwoman Wendy Evans said: "The health board already has a waiting time of 15 months for patients awaiting orthopaedic surgery. "This will clearly add at least another five to six months to their waiting time, causing further distress and possibly further complications to their condition." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have been reassured by Hywel Dda Health Board that, at this stage, it is simply exploring options to ensure it is best placed to respond to demands on emergency care services this winter. "One option involves proposals to re-schedule some planned orthopaedic surgery, so it has the capacity minimise the distress caused by last-minute cancellations. We are assured that all urgent, cancer and day surgery would continue. "The health board will give careful consideration to this proposed option and discuss it widely with staff and stakeholders before any final decision is taken." However, the Welsh Conservatives' health spokesman Darren Millar said the decision had been forced upon the health board by "Labour's inability to recruit permanent staff and properly invest in the health service". He added: "Carwyn Jones's legacy of health budget cuts continues to heap untold pressures on frontline staff and - yet again - it is patients who will suffer. "There should be absolutely no suggestion of cancelled operations. "The health board should work with the independent sector to ensure that patients can access the treatment they need." William Powell, Lib Dem AM for mid and west Wales, said he had asked for the Health Minister Mark Drakeford to answer an urgent question about the issue in the Senedd on Tuesday. Last week Hywel Dda said it was postponing some operations at Bronglais Hospital in Aberystwyth for up to a month because of staff shortages. The board said it was also cutting six beds on a general surgery ward because of the shortages. Plaid Cymru's Ceredigion AM Elin Jones claimed the management of the health service in west Wales was approaching meltdown. She added: "The sudden cancellation of all elective orthopaedic surgery outside Carmarthen, on top of the bed closures last week at Bronglais and persistent rumours of the run-down of services elsewhere, is undermining the confidence of people in Ceredigion and across west Wales." Last January non-emergency operations were cancelled in north and south Wales due to a seasonal rise in winter illnesses putting pressure on NHS hospitals. </body>

      <body>Close family, friends and colleagues of the former Football Association of Wales (FAW) president Tegwyn Evans have attended his funeral. Mr Evans, 85, of Welshpool, Powys, died on 8 October, a week after suffering a heart attack. Officials from the FAW attended the funeral service which was held in Welshpool on Monday. A minute's silence was observed for Mr Evans ahead of Wales' World Cup game against Macedonia on 11 October. Mr Evans was described as "passionate" about football, serving as an FAW council member since 1975 and as president from 2003 to 2006. He was also a former mayor of Welshpool, a president of the local football club and a successful businessman. The FAW has said Mr Evans, who was chairman of the Central Wales FA, was a "lifelong stalwart of mid Wales football". Following his death, it said: "During his time at the FAW he was a fine ambassador for the game at home and abroad and made many friends. "Everyone at the FAW salutes his service to football in Wales and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time." Away from football, Mr Evans was heavily involved in his local community and was widely known as "Mr Welshpool". He served on Welshpool Town Council for many years, including a spell as mayor between 1981 and 1983. In 2002, he was awarded the MBE for his services to the town and to Welshpool Football Club. </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Some health boards are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales finds.</description>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent Â£500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed.

      <body>The search for a second permanent Gypsies and travellers' site in Swansea looks set to be widened across the city after councillors threw out the recommended options. Following a consultation, a report said the new site should be on council-owned land either in Cockett or Llansamlet. But after councillors debated the sites and three other locations that were considered, they voted to start again. Using private land and expanding the existing Llansamlet site are options. "I personally feel we should have been looking at an all-wider Swansea basis for the land," said Labour councillor Robert Francis-Davies, who proposed a new recommendation to ask cabinet to widen the search. "We should adopt a whole Swansea approach and consider all land options." Councillors voted unanimously to back the amendment and it is now up to cabinet to make the final decision. Five possible sites had been under consideration, including two in Gorseinon with the others in Penderry ward, Cockett and Llansamlet. During the meeting, representatives from all five sites and members of the traveller community gave their views on the proposals. The travellers said they wanted a second site in Llansamlet and were open to expanding the current site, but the council was warned that it was unlikely as it is on a flood plain. David Phillips, leader of Labour-led Swansea council, warned in advance of the meeting that issue was going to be "divisive". Swansea council said the Welsh government had insisted all local authorities in Wales look at the needs of Gypsies and travellers "as part of its assessment of accommodation needs". Residents had until 31 March to give their views and a number of campaigns have been launched in opposition to proposals for particular areas. A council spokesperson said: "The latest proposal is that we look at more sites within Swansea to see if there is somewhere suitable for a Gypsy and traveller site. "Our latest housing accommodation needs assessment shows there is a need to develop a second site in the city. "A number of families are residing in Swansea on unlawful and illegal sites and one of the ways to tackle this issue is to ensure they have a legal site for their homes." </body>

      <body>Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips has been asked to explain himself to Bayonne's directors after allegedly turning up to a video analysis session under the influence of alcohol. Phillips and two team-mates will meet the board on Tuesday to give their side of events. The alleged incident occurred the day after the Amlin Cup win over Grenoble. The 31-year-old British and Irish Lions number nine was suspended by the club in 2012 for off-field misconduct. Phillips was also suspended from the Wales squad in July 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre when he was involved in a confrontation with a doorman. The 77-times capped former Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys player joined Bayonne following the World Cup in the autumn of 2011. He was a key member of the Lions team that beat Australia 2-1 in the Test series last summer, setting up the opening try for Alex Corbisiero in the decisive third Test match victory in Sydney. He has also won two Six Nations Grand Slams with Wales in 2008 and 2012. New Zealanders Wayne Haare and Stephen Brett are the other players who will have to explain their actions to Bayonne board on Tuesday. </body>

      <body>Councillors have met in Carmarthenshire to discuss ways to cut Â£30m from the authority's budget. Local businesses were invited to the meeting in Y Ffwrnes, Llanelli, to view 60 possible options for how the savings can be achieved. The authority has already warned hundreds of jobs could go. Last week the Welsh government announced Carmarthenshire council's budget for next year will be cut by 3.9%. Ahead of the meeting, council leader councillor Kevin Madge, said: "Monday's event is probably one of the most important events I will have taken part in during my 30 years as a councillor. "This event is just the start of a three-month process for determining our budget for next year which will include an extensive public consultation." Mr Madge said there would be a series of local events for the public who will be encouraged to give their views by post, email or via a consultation section on the council website which will be launched in a few weeks' time. "We will also be seeking the views of representative groups such as the Citizens Panel, the 50+ Forum, Youth Forum and Carmarthenshire Disability Coalition," he added. "We will be urging as many people as possible to give us their views as this is a critical time for local government and the decisions we make now will have a long lasting effect for many years to come." </body>

      <body>Further tests are to be carried out on the body of a woman whose death in Newport is being treated as suspicious. Gwent Police said results from a post mortem examination on 45-year-old Sandie Hardman were inconclusive. Officers had been called to a disturbance at her flat on Thursday night and were then called to hospital on Friday morning where she later died. A woman aged 23 and a man, 44, both from Newport, have been released on bail after being questioned. Police said the further tests would include toxicology work. Gwent Police said officers had been called to a disturbance at Ms Hardman's flat in Sorrel Drive, Newport, last Thursday evening. The police were then called to the Royal Gwent Hospital on Friday morning after Ms Hardman had been admitted, but she later died. The force said as was mandatory in cases of death following police contact, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and had since been referred back to Gwent Police for local investigation. Det Supt Ian Roberts said: "Our thoughts remain with Sandie's family at this difficult time and specialist officers have been providing them with support. "As part of our investigation to work out exactly what happened to Sandie I would urge anyone who may have had contact with her in the days and hours leading up to her death to call 101 quoting log 01 18/10/13. "Information can also be provided anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111." Two people have been released on police bail after being arrested and questioned on suspicion of murder. </body>

      <title>Davies praises 'magnificent' Blues</title>

      <body>Cardiff Blues director of rugby Phil Davies has praised his side as "magnificent" and "superb" for beating Heineken Cup holders Toulon 19-15 a week after being hammered at Exeter. "The players were magnificent, they fronted up superbly. It was a great win against a very good team," said Davies. Jonny Wilkinson edged a kicking duel with Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny that gave the French side a 15-12 lead. But replacement Gareth Davies scored a dramatic late try to beat Toulon. Former England and British and Irish Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked five penalties to Patchell's single success and Halfpenny's trio of shots to leave the Blues trailing 15-12 going into the last 10 minutes. Davies had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson's last kick went over and finished off a move started by centre Cory Allen in style. Wales and Lions star Halfpenny added the conversion and the Blues held out as Toulon launched a series of late attacks. The scenes of celebration that followed were in stark contrast to those that were witnessed at Exeter, where Davies' side conceded five first-half tries. Davies said: "We were disappointed with the first half last week, but we showed a lot of resilience in the second period to come back and get a bonus point. "And that bonus point looks pretty good today. "Physically and emotionally, the players went perhaps to another level today. "I think that was the youngest back division that Cardiff Blues have ever put on the field. "We are back in the group, which is the most important thing. "We've just got to keep building and building and become more consistent. "It was great we got the result and it was great to hear the crowd singing. It was like the old days. "We will keep moving forward and hopefully we can replicate more days like this one." </body>

      <title>Hartson 'offered to quit Wales role'</title>
      <description>Wales assistant boss John Hartson says he has offered to resign on several occasions in the wake of media criticism.</description>

      <body>Wales assistant manager John Hartson says he offered to quit his role on several occasions in recent months. The 38-year-old former Wales striker joined manager Chris Coleman's coaching staff for the start of the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign. Hartson, capped 51 times, was prepared to leave in the wake of media criticism of Coleman's backroom team. "I've offered to resign a couple of times in the last couple of months but Chris wants me there," he said. "He feels I've got a lot to offer the players having played up front on my own for 10 years for Wales. "You're always going to get criticism. I'm very relaxed about it. I've come through cancer for goodness sake - I don't worry about coaching roles with Wales." The former Arsenal striker had emergency surgery in 2009 after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. He joined Coleman's staff after his former international team-mate was appointed manager. Hartson said: "I've had a fantastic welcome from the lads and I enjoy it. "If he [Coleman] decides to take the job on and he wants to let myself, [coach] Kit Symons and [coach] Osian Roberts go, then that's fine by me. "If he takes me on then I'll probably stay with him." There is still uncertainty over former Fulham and Coventry City boss Coleman's position with the national side. Coleman has not decided if he wants to carry on as manager after his contract expires in November. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has been in talks with the 43-year-old, who took charge in January 2012. Wales ended their unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaign with a 1-0 win over Macedonia and a 1-1 draw in Belgium. FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford will assess Coleman's overall record in the job, and Hartson believes the manager should be given a new deal. "I hope the FAW can get their heads together and actually give him a new two-year contract because I think he is the man to take us forward," Hartson said. "You just wonder whether Chris wants to take it on and wonder whether the FAW wants to take him on. "I talk to Chris about many topics but the one thing I don't discuss with Chris is his personal situation. "I don't discuss his contract [and] I don't discuss what he's going to do. That is his business." Hartson believes Wales are entering a "great period" as they prepare for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He added: "I don't think it's a great time to bring the next manager in right now because we have given players an opportunity. "We've got a great mix of youth and experience." </body>

      <title>Welsh firms lose out on policy bids</title>
      <description>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged.</description>

      <body>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged. While most tenders for work are put out to everyone, ministers in Cardiff have adopted a UK government process to evaluate certain schemes. Only one company from Wales is registered to bid. The Welsh government said the process provided value for money. Only one company from Wales is registered with the department responsible in London, which means the others have been unable to bid for more than Â£800,000 worth of contracts, including a review of the Welsh government's flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme. Another research project involved assessing a Welsh government initiative to increase the amount of goods and services public bodies bought from Welsh companies. The Welsh government says between 80% and 90% of its tenders are open to all. A spokesperson said: "We are committed to encouraging Welsh businesses and higher education institutions to benefit from public sector contracts. We purchase the majority of our research via open tender or via our own procurement framework which does include a number of Welsh businesses. "We occasionally make use of the procurement framework operated by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) which provides good value for money." It said several Welsh organisations had been brought in as sub-contractors. Organisations such as the consultancies, Iaith and Oldbell 3, and the Cardiff Business School have been involved in some projects. The information emerged following freedom of information requests by Plaid Cymru. The party accuses the Welsh government of failing to "practise what it preaches" by allowing some businesses to be "cut out" of some contracts. North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd dismissed the claim that much of the work was sub-contracted back to Wales. "They take their top slice, they pocket that and they sub-contract Welsh companies to actually deliver large parts of the work , but at a fraction of the cost," he said. "So the key issue here is that the Welsh economy is in effect a leaking bucket. "There's a hole in the Welsh economy with all this potential money for Welsh businesses flowing out of Wales. We need to plug that leak." Iestyn Davies, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Cymru, said: "The government spends significant money through small businesses and large companies and it's important that the value is felt in the communities where those businesses are based. "When you spend money outside of Wales, that money's lost to Wales. "It's a very simple equation. "So good public sector procurement can leave a long-lasting value and legacy within communities. It doesn't matter how big the contract is, it can still have a real impact on a small local business." </body>

      <title>Labour attacks Tory education plans</title>
      <description>Conservative plans to cut education spending in Wales would lead to nearly 10,000 teachers losing their jobs, Labour claims.</description>

      <body>Welsh Conservative plans to cut education spending in Wales would lead to nearly 10,000 teachers losing their jobs, Labour has claimed. Labour also warned such cuts would mean class sizes of 50 or 60 pupils. Conservatives said they would keep 2011 assembly election spending priorities, including protecting the health budget. Denying they would cut teacher numbers, the Conservatives said the Welsh Labour government had got education "catastrophically wrong" for a decade. Before the 2011 assembly election, the Welsh Conservatives published a shadow budget laying out what their spending priorities were they to win power. The party promised to ring-fence health funding, which would have meant bigger cuts in other departments, including a 12% reduction in the education budget. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies AM has said recently the party would maintain those spending commitments. Quoting independent analysis from the assembly members Research Service, Labour said the reduction in education spending was the equivalent of 9,757 full-time teachers losing their jobs across Wales. Labour AM Keith Davies warned job cuts on that scale would be "catastrophic". "Either the Welsh Conservatives are playing politics, as they know full well there is more chance of Andrew RT Davies winning Mastermind than becoming first minister of Wales, or they are deadly serious about savaging teaching staff numbers so ruthlessly that we'd face classes of 50 or 60 pupils. "We are all fully aware of the grim financial situation that frontline services face in Wales because of David Cameron's vicious austerity programme, but to concentrate cuts on education on such a scale would bring the school system to its knees." Conservatives said their policy of funding schools directly, rather than via local education authorities, would save Â£100m and they attacked Labour's education record. Mr Davies said: "Far from cutting the number of teachers in Wales - Welsh Conservatives would empower them, giving staff and parents far more say about what happens in classrooms. "Direct funding of schools would get rid of the unwanted red tape and bureaucracy that hampers our teaching staff - while freeing up a Â£100 million of additional investment for schools. "We will take no lectures from a hypocritical Labour party that has got it catastrophically wrong on education for the last ten years," he added. </body>

      <title>MP questions BBC's internal scrutiny</title>
      <description>A Welsh Tory MP questions scrutiny of internal affairs and financial transparency at the BBC after securing a Commons debate.</description>

      <body>Conservative MP Alun Cairns has questioned scrutiny of internal affairs and financial transparency at the BBC. The Vale of Glamorgan MP led a debate in Parliament to discuss the future of the corporation on Monday. The BBC has recently faced criticism over its handling of claims of abuse by presenter Jimmy Savile during his employment at the corporation, and over executive payoffs. The BBC said it would publish details of its external spending in due course. Despite saying "the BBC holds a unique place in British society", the Vale MP told the Commons that it did not "make it special or above scrutiny." Mr Cairns said: "The BBC rightly plays an important part in scrutinising public and independent organisations. "Its journalists are amongst the best in the world. Its investigative reports have exposed wrongdoing and failure of many individuals and private and public bodies. "Yet it seems that none of these skills are encouraged to scrutinise in-house matters. The BBC doesn't interrogate its own internal affairs with the same rigour as it does so well of outside bodies. "How many scandals or examples of wrongdoing about the BBC have been prompted by the BBC? Some may argue that it is not their job but I disagree. "It receives Â£3bn a year in public money from the licence fee - probably the UK's most regressive tax," he added. But Labour MP Chris Bryant disagreed, saying the BBC often scrutinised top officials. The Rhondda MP said: "I've heard every single Director General and most directors of programmes be quizzed on BBC television and radio with equal aggression as any politician that they might query, whereas I don't recall ever, not even throughout the whole business of the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World, recall Rupert Murdoch being interviewed by Sky." Mr Cairns also raised concerns over almost Â£5m spent on three BBC inquiries into the Jimmy Savile scandal. He has been campaigning for greater transparency of the BBC's finances. The Welsh Tory backbencher introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill last November that called for all invoices in excess of Â£500 to be published in the same way as local authorities. "I must say that I was very disappointed with their response to the call at the time - which was basically an unequivocal rejection," Mr Cairns told fellow MPs. A spokesperson on behalf of the BBC said that such a requirement would place the corporation "at a considerable competitive disadvantage" "As part of our commitment to being open and transparent, we will be publishing our external spend in due course, however, we need to achieve a good balance of useful and transparent information of what we purchase, with the need to secure value for money. "As the BBC operates in a predominantly commercial sector, we would be placed at a considerable competitive disadvantage if we were required to release all invoices. "This could see an increase in our costs and thus a reduction in value for money for the licence fee payer." On Friday the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, called for BBC Wales to be made accountable to the Welsh assembly. </body>

      <title>Walsh fears Mackay could still leave</title>
      <description>Former Cardiff City player Ian Walsh fears manager Malky Mackay could still leave the club if "results don't go well".</description>

      <body>Former Cardiff City striker Ian Walsh believes manager Malky Mackay could still leave the Premier League club if results do not go his way. Mackay has denied being asked to resign over club owner Vincent Tan's decision to axe head of recruitment Iain Moody. But BBC reporter Pat Murphy has claimed on Radio 5 Live that Tan has tried to influence tactics during matches. "You can't have a manager... accept that sort of attitude from people in the directors' box," said Walsh. "It's quite laughable really to think that that could possibly be happening. "Obviously we don't know for sure, but if it is happening or they have tried to do that [offer tactical suggestions during games] it will only go one way." BBC Radio 5 reporter Murphy said club chief executive Simon Lim had been given notes by Tan to pass to Mackay, but that the manager had avoided taking them and that coaching staff had not passed on the information to the Scotsman. Mackay was known to be upset at Moody's removal from the club and, in spite of the board offering him their backing, Walsh believes any interference from above could hasten Mackay's departure. The former Wales international striker also believes Tan could benefit from an experienced advisor to guide him in football matters. "Vincent Tan has got involved and I think without the arm to guide him at his side he seems to be like a loose cannon making decisions," added Walsh. "Ultimately you could see in the next few games if results don't go well for Cardiff City, Malky might go and there'll be other teams who will be on the phone the same day for Malky Mackay. "He is one of the best up and coming managers, so there will be clubs out there. If Malky Mackay leaves Cardiff City it will be someone else's gain and that I feel is very, very sad." </body>

      <title>Wales tactics vulnerable to injuries</title>
      <description>Ex-captain Gareth Llewellyn says if Wales lose to South Africa in November, coach Warren Gatland must rethink tactics.</description>

      <body>Former captain Gareth Llewellyn believes Wales' approach to the 2015 World Cup will be determined by how they fare in four November Tests. Wales provided 16 British and Irish Lions in Australia in 2013, having won the 2012 and 2103 Six Nations titles. But Llewellyn says Wales' power tactics make them vulnerable to injuries. And if Wales fail to beat South Africa on 9 November, Llewellyn contends: "We do have to have a little look at the way we play." The former lock says coach Warren Gatland's tactics would not succeed if scrum-half Mike Phillips and centre Jamie Roberts are injured. Racing Metro centre Roberts is likely to miss Wales' forthcoming Tests because of an ankle injury. And Phillips faces a disciplinary hearing at Bayonne on Tuesday to answer allegations that he attended a video analysis session while under the influence of alcohol. Gatland is due to announce his squad for the November internationals on Tuesday. Wales face Argentina on 16 November, take on Tonga the following Friday, 22 November and complete their series against Australia eight days later. Wales lost to Argentina, Samoa, New Zealand and the Wallabies in the 2012 autumn series. They then recovered from an opening 2013 Six Nations defeat by Ireland to retain the title. Former Neath, Harlequins and Ospreys lock Llewellyn won 92 caps between 1989 and 2004. He questions Wales' likelihood of succeeding at the 2015 World Cup with a game plan dubbed "Warrenball" by sections of the Australian media during the Lions' successful 2013 tour to Australia which Gatland led. "Can our power game that we play, if you like, sustain us against South Africa and New Zealand?" pondered Llewellyn on Radio Wales Sport's rugby show. "And that's always been the worry for me. "We've had an unprecedented success at international level, three Grand Slams or whatever it is in the last eight years. "But it's when we overpower people up front and Jamie Roberts is fit. "We lost in the autumn last year, not because Warren Gatland was away [with the Lions], but because we had a raft of injuries and we didn't have the players to carry out that strategy and that game plan. "And we're going up against a South Africa team who play that type of game. "If we can't overpower South Africa then maybe we need to look to add another string to our bow to take to the 2015 World Cup. "We all know the type of game plan we play and we'll be without Jamie Roberts to do it. "If we go out and play the way we normally play and we beat South Africa, then that is the game [plan] we take into the World Cup. "If we don't beat South Africa by playing that game and we can't out-physical them or overpower them, which for me is our type of rugby - gain-line, winning the collision - then we do have to have a little look at the way we play. "So we just need to have a look at what type of game we take into the World Cup and how we adjust things so that the next time we play South Africa or New Zealand, we beat them. "If you lose Mike Phillips and Jamie Roberts, can you play that game? That's the question and I think last autumn we tried to play the same game and we needed to change. "And that's why we lost." </body>

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association for his behaviour in the win against Cardiff on Saturday. Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting. "I don't know why the referee stopped me doing my work," the Portuguese said before the charge was announced. The 50-year-old, who went to sit with fans in the stand, has until 18:00 BST on 24 October to respond to the charge. "To be with the fans was not funny," Mourinho said in Dusseldorf airport ahead of Tuesday's Champions League group match with Schalke. "It is frustrating. You want to communicate with the players and you couldn't do it." Mourinho's dismissal was not the only controversial moment in the match. Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's equaliser in the 4-1 victory after Samuel Eto'o had kicked the ball away from Bluebirds goalkeeper David Marshall as he bounced it. According to Fifa rules, Cardiff should have been awarded a free-kick, but referee Taylor incorrectly allowed play to continue. When asked about the incident on Monday, Mourinho preferred to concentrate on apparent time-wasting from Malky Mackay's side. "If I was in that game and I was paying my ticket, I would be worried with the fact that every time the ball was out or stopped and our opponent had to put the ball back in the game, it took a median (average) of 21.5 seconds," he said. "That is a waste of money. "When you multiply that by the number of times the game was stopped, you pay for 90 minutes but you see 55 or 60. For me, that's breaking the rules." When he did get around to addressing the Eto'o incident, he called it an "intelligent action" and disagreed with the Fifa law governing the incident. "If, in this moment, Fifa says that it's a foul, it's a foul," said Mourinho. "But I think Samuel did well. Maybe the referee did wrong, I don't know to be fair. But in my opinion, that should be allowed." Mourinho was last ordered to the stands in May, when he was still Real Madrid manager. He protested after a decision went against his team in the Copa del Rey final defeat by city rivals Atletico. </body>

Hywel Dda Health Board said it would not carry out some elective orthopaedic operations like hip and knee replacements to help it cope with emergency demand.

      <body>One hundred million pounds is being invested in Welsh companies to work on renewable energy projects which will support 350 jobs. They include Pen y Cymoedd wind farm which will see 76 turbines across the Neath, Afan, Rhondda and Cynon valleys. Ruthin-based Jones Brothers and Balfour Beatty have been contracted to provide civil and electrical works at the site. Owners Vattenfall are also hiring Chepstow-based Mabey Bridge to supply towers for a wind farm in Scotland. Turbines are expected to be installed at Pen y Cymoedd in February next year with the project fully operational by 2016. The site is expected to increase renewable electricity generation in Wales by more than a third, producing enough renewable energy to power the equivalent of 140,000 homes. Huw Jones, managing director of Jones Brothers, said: "We will be drawing on our pool of Welsh engineers and labour to deliver the project, as well as creating new jobs and a skills legacy for the region." Vattenfall is also hiring a Chepstow-based company, Mabey Bridge Energy and Marine, to provided 18 turbines towers for a wind farm in Scotland. Mark Coia, managing director of Mabey Bridge, said: "Our significant investment in wind energy technology demonstrates we are committed to the renewables industry and the development of Welsh jobs within the sector for the long term, and this new contract further helps to maintain and develop skilled positions for the 260-strong workforce at our manufacturing facilities in Chepstow." Piers Guy, Vattenfall's director of onshore wind, said: "These large contracts show that the Welsh workforce has the skills and capabilities to work on large onshore wind energy projects in Wales and beyond. "We have made clear from day one that we will maximise the opportunities for Welsh companies through Pen y Cymoedd." He added that there would be "more good news" for suppliers in the coming months in relation to the site. </body>

      <description>Enterprise zones promising 6,500 jobs, first minister says</description>

      <body>The first minister has said there are 6,500 jobs "in the pipeline" in Welsh enterprise zones. Carwyn Jones' comments came as he announced accountancy firm Deloitte will create 100 jobs in the Cardiff zone over the next three years. He also announced a cut in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). Welsh Conservatives say the enterprise zones still have "a long way to go". At his monthly press conference, the first minister defended his Welsh government's enterprise zone policy saying they "are the envy of the rest of the UK". There are seven enterprise zones in Wales, each dedicated to nurture specific industries. Companies have access to a range of benefits, including business rate relief, enhanced capital allowances, skills support, superfast broadband, bespoke infrastructure projects and simplified planning rules. Carwyn Jones said almost 2,000 jobs have been created across the seven zones, with a further 6,500 planned, 3,000 of them in the Cardiff zone. Located in the centre of the capital, a further 100 jobs are set to be created in the zone dedicated to financial services as financial advisory firm Deloitte's is set to expand. Deloitte will set up the Cardiff Centre of Excellence to support its International Assignment Services, helping employers meet tax compliance. The Welsh government has invested Â£170,000 into the project, which will centralise client administration and support. Carwyn Jones welcomed the news at the firm's Cardiff headquarters. "This latest expansion which is set to create 100 jobs in Cardiff sends out a strong message that Wales is becoming the location of choice for companies operating in the professional and financial services sector that are looking to grow their business," he said. "I am hugely encouraged that Cardiff has been selected and confident this latest project will build on the success of their quality and risk operations team in Cardiff. "Wales is the first place in the UK with an enterprise zone dedicated to this sector and Central Cardiff Enterprise Zone is helping to enhance the city's position as a capital location for professional business services." Shadow Minister for Business Nick Ramsay AM, said: "This is extremely welcome news - and long overdue. "Progress on the Labour government's enterprise zone in Cardiff has been disappointingly slow - and today's announcement is a step in the right direction. "In the two years since this zone's announcement, very little has been announced and very few details released. "There is a long way to go on every enterprise zone in Wales and I am pleased that some progress is finally being made." The first minister also announced SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment bank. The Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to look at the bank's interest rates more widely. Eluned Parrott AM, said: "This announcement will be welcomed by small and medium sized businesses planning on investing in Enterprise Zones, however, questions still have to be answered as to why Finance Wales's interest rates are higher than they need to be across the country. "I do hope that the Welsh Government will look seriously at the interest rates it is offering through Finance Wales across the country, and take action to ensure that its rates are comparable with the market not unnecessarily expensive for companies who are trying to create wealth and encourage growth." The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Wales said the announcement raises some questions. FSB Welsh Policy Unit chair Janet Jones said: "The announcement of a 2% cut in rates from Finance Wales for businesses in Welsh enterprise zones is welcome, but rather perplexing. "The Welsh government's own report into access to finance by Professor Dylan Jones-Evans noted that Finance Wales' interest rates were often well above their regulatory requirements. "FSB Wales agrees with that assessment, and this announcement suggests that there is more flexibility in Finance Wales' setting of its interest rates than was previously stated. "In the light of this announcement we would call for Finance Wales to re-examine its rates as it appears that state aid rules do not require rates to be as high as they are at present," she added. </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An on-going dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". The owners of the Grangemouth complex are to meet later to decide on the plant's fate. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite union said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Senior figures at Ineos, which operates and owns most of the 2.6 sq-mile site, are to consider the workforce's response to the offer. In doing so, they will also look at the patterns of the result across the plant, and across its varied technical skills. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." The plan includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined contribution scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support the plan at this stage would receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <title>Scottish Power to pay Â£8.5m penalty</title>
      <description>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling. Ofgem said customers were misled during sales approaches due to Scottish Power's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. Consumers on the "warm home discount" will receive about Â£50 each. Money will also go to those who were misled. The company has apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012. "Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations," said Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison. Scottish Power will pay Â£7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty. It estimates each will receive a payment of about Â£50. It has also set up a Â£1m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. "Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers," the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. "We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected," said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. "This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. "However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. "Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored." Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling. In April, Ofgem said that SSE was guilty of management failures that led to "prolonged and extensive" mis-selling through telephone, in-store and doorstep sales. The regulator handed down a record Â£10.5m fine. Two other investigations - into Npower and E.On, are ongoing. Energy companies no longer sell energy door-to-door, a change that has reduced the number of people switching suppliers in recent times, figures show. Also on Tuesday, new rules from Ofgem came into force preventing energy firms from increasing prices during fixed-term contracts. Firms are also banned from automatically rolling customers on to another fixed-term offer when their current one ends. Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. "Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. "Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them," added Mr Wright. The reform follows Ofgem's research showing that even on fixed-term deals, suppliers could still increase prices. </body>

      <body>Heavy rainfall across parts of Scotland has caused flooding and travel problems in southern and central areas. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning covering Central, Tayside, Fife, Strathclyde, the Borders, south west Scotland and the Borders. Flood alerts and warnings are in place for parts of Tayside, Ayrshire, Central and Dumfries and Galloway. A number of roads across the country have also been closed as a result of the downpours. A fallen tree and power cable blocked the B725 Dalton to Hoddom road in Dumfries and Galloway. Many roads were severely flooded, including the A737 which was closed between Kilbarchan and Howwood in Renfrewshire. Surface water has caused problems on the M74 in the Lanarkshire area and drivers have also been warned to take care on all routes in Dumfries and Galloway. Train passengers faced cancellations and delays through Anniesland and Westerton in Glasgow because of flooding. Flooding between Dalmuir and Garscadden was also disrupting trains through those stations to Motherwell, Springburn and Lanark. Corsehill Primary in North Ayrshire has been closed as a result of the bad weather. The worst of the rain was expected to have passed by early afternoon. </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Call to review roof space loophole</title>
      <description>An MSP has written to the housing minister about a legal loophole which allows landlords of top-floor flats to build into communal roof space.</description>

      <body>An MSP has called on the government to review a legal loophole which allows landlords of top-floor flats to build into communal roof space. Some property developers have been converting tenements flats into larger properties for rent in Edinburgh in a bid to reap financial rewards. Although roof repairs are shared by all residents in a block, top-floor flat owners are able to install windows. Alison Johnstone said there was a need to raise awareness of the issue. The Green MSP told BBC Scotland that greater protection for tenement residents was needed. She said: "We have heard of a couple of cases in Edinburgh where the top floor flat, from a one bedroom flat is being developed to a four bedroom flat and neighbours have had no warning at all, which is simply not good enough. "That just makes you feel really disempowered and when constituents have gone to planning and to building regulators they have been told there is nothing they can do. "I think it is worth the government having a look at the legislation in this area, to make sure that all those who live in tenements enjoy the full protection and understand exactly what can happen in that space." A top floor flat in Dalry was turned into a three bedroom property after Glasgow-based developer James Logan of Solenglen Ltd, who was unavailable for comment, knocked through into the communal attic and roof. The loft space at Murieston Terrace was fitted out with two bedrooms and a bathroom, and builders cut through the roof to install five windows. The landlord has 11 other large, shared flats in the area. HMOs (house in multiple occupation) can earn landlords in excess of Â£1,250 a month in rent. Edinburgh City Council does not require landlords to have planning permission to create an HMO flat out of a smaller property and communal roof space. However, the other owners in the tenement block are still liable to pay an equal share of the costs of maintaining the roof. Jim and Betty Russell have lived on the stair at Murieston Terrace for 47 years, said: "Until this happened everyone in our stair thought they had a joint share in the attic space and roof. "In all our time here neighbours have paid equal shares of repair costs and maintenance. "We don't know where we stand now and how can it be fair that one owner can ride rough shod doing whatever he wants for his own benefit and profit, without even having the courtesy to let neighbours know what is intended. "We find it incredible that a building warrant can be provided without checks occurring to determine ownership or that the agreement of other owners has been provided." An Edinburgh City Council spokeswoman said: "Dispute of land ownership is a civil matter and the council has no powers to get involved." </body>

      <body>A man has been jailed for five years after being convicted of attacking and sexually assaulting a woman he claimed spat on his bacon sandwich. Gerrard Carr, 36, attacked the woman at the first-floor flat in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, on 1 March. The victim escaped from a window after being indecently assaulted, punched, kicked and hit with a baseball bat. At the High Court in Edinburgh, Carr was told he would remain on the sex offenders' register indefinitely. The 36-year-old, who denied the sexual element of the charge, was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow last month. Jailing him, judge Lady Scott told Carr: "You have been convicted of a serious assault to severe injury and to the danger of life. "In a rage you struck your victim with a baseball bat repeatedly then chased her upstairs and subjected her to a sexual assault. "You will remain on the sex offenders' register indefinitely." Carr's trial at the High Court in Glasgow heard how he attacked the woman amid claims she spat on his bacon sandwich. He grabbed a baseball bat and repeatedly struck her before punching and kicking his victim. He also flicked a cigarette on her, molested her, and pulled her bra, breaking a strap. The jury heard she was in "excruciating pain" and thought her leg had snapped. She was left "so scared" she escaped from a first-storey window to get away from Carr. He gave evidence during the trial and told the jury that he "regretted" what happened. He insisted that when he first picked up the bat, he had just wanted the woman to leave the house. Prosecutor David Young QC asked: "Why hit her?" Carr replied: "I was angry - by that time my temper had just broken. I felt hurt because she had spat in my sandwiches. "I hit her with the baseball bat, but it was a reaction. I thought that I was entitled to ask her to leave. "The attack only happened over a matter of seconds. If I had time to process my thoughts, I would not have hit her with the bat." The court heard the victim tried to get out after being struck and that there was later so much blood, the woman was virtually unrecognisable. She was said to have fled upstairs and was left "cowering" in fear. Mr Young put to Carr that he "pursued" her to "carry on the attack". But, Carr replied: "No, it was just to ask her why she had spat in my pieces." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <body>Privately-funded housing projects are on the rebound, according to a construction market survey. About a third more chartered surveyors reported increases in work in the three months to September compared with the previous quarter. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said this was the highest rate since 2007. It said growth had been reported in each part of the UK for the first time since the start of the market crash. The survey suggested that workloads in the overall construction sector had increased at their strongest rate in the past five years. Employment prospects also increased, with a higher proportion of surveyors expecting more jobs to be created over the next year. Sarah Speirs, director of Rics Scotland, said: "While it's certainly good news that construction, and especially house building, is finally on the rise right across Scotland, we are certainly not out of the woods yet. "Critically, we are still way behind in terms of building enough homes to meet the nation's growing housing need. "In response to this, Rics has recently launched the Scottish Housing Commission which, with cross-sector examination, will provide a detailed recommendation report in January 2014." </body>

      <body>Children in Scotland spend too much time starting at screens and obesity among them is at record levels, according to a new study. An expert group, led by Strathclyde University, has produced a "report card" on the physical activity of Scotland's youngsters. It has graded them across various categories including diet, sedentary behaviour and outside influences. An "F" was awarded for physical activity and an "F-minus" for obesity. The Active Healthy Kids Scotland Report Card was complied by the universities of Strathclyde and Aberdeen, and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Healthy Active Living and Obesity Research Institute. It highlighted that levels of obesity among young people are at a record high, with at least 16% of two-to-15 year olds were obese in 2011, with higher rates among more deprived children. The report also pointed out that only 19% of adolescent boys and 11% of girls, aged 11-to-15 years, met the Scottish, UK and international recommendation of a least 60 minutes per day of at least moderate-intensity physical activity. An "F" grade was also awarded in the sedentary behaviour category, with 76% 11-to-15 year olds watching more than two hours of television per day - and 77% of boys, and 37% of girls, reporting two hours of gaming every day on top of their TV viewing. John Reilly, professor of physical activity and public health science at Strathclyde University, said: "The grades in the report card provide a robust assessment of the 'state of the nation' - how we are doing as a country in promoting physical activity and health among children and adolescents in Scotland. "These grades are judged against an evidence-based benchmark and determined by the percentage of Scottish children and adolescents meeting the benchmark." A "D-minus" was awarded to diet, with sugar and saturated fat intake both far exceeding recommended levels. The study also said just 14% of children ate the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. A "D-minus" rating was also given to family and peer influence, as Scottish Health Survey statistics showed almost half of adult men and a third of adult women took the recommended 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week. The report awarded a "B" to both community and the built environment, and to national policy, strategy and investment. A "C" was given to active transportation, while both organised sports participation and active and active and outdoor play were marked "incomplete", due to a lack of data. Prof Reilly said: "This report card - Scotland's first of its kind - provides a critical, current and comprehensive assessment of the physical activity and health of Scotland's children and adolescents. "The report card should be used as an advocacy tool, and as the basis of public debate, policy discussion and change." He said the intention was for an international report card to be published in May 2014, so that Scotland can be compared against other countries. The next Scottish report card to due to be published in May 2015. </body>

      <body>An Aberdeen man who stabbed his girlfriend in the neck and told her "if I can't have you nobody can" has been jailed for four years. Alec Allan, 30, attacked Julie Smith, 32, in an "utterly unprovoked" assault in a flat in the city's Lewis Road in September last year. Allan admitted assault to severe injury and the danger of life. The High Court in Edinburgh heard the victim was "very lucky" the injuries did not penetrate the carotid artery. Allan had then sat on her legs and said: "Look what you've made me do." The former patient at a psychiatric hospital had stopped taking his prescribed medication days before the attack. Lord Pentland told him: "This offence involved a violent attack and repeated use of a weapon against a lady with whom you were then in a relationship. "You had been drinking and neglected to take your prescribed medication. "You must have known this combination of factors substantially increased the risk that you would lose control of yourself." The judge also ordered that he be under supervision for a further three years, during which time he will be monitored and can be returned to prison if he does not comply with conditions. Defence counsel David Moggach said Allan had "quite a violent upbringing", and added: "It appears that has led to him dealing with stressful incidents by reverting to violence." </body>

      <body>Archaeologists say they have confirmed the location of a meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. Called a "thing", evidence of the mound was uncovered during excavations of Dingwall's Cromartie Memorial car park. When it was constructed in the 11th Century, the thing would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the Peffery. Archaeologists and historians believe it was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty. The powerful Viking earl, who died in 1065, is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. Experts suggest a road, ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire and large parts of the north of Scotland. Thorfinn's rise to power was aid by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth. At the height of his power he was lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. In Scotland, thing sites can also be found in Shetland and Orkney. Clues to the location of Dingwall's thing included an 18th Century plan of the town. OJT Heritage and Dingwall History Society were involved in excavating parts of Cromartie Memorial car park, which is on a piece of land known as the Hillyard. David MacDonald was commissioned to put together a historical investigative report on the thing site. In his report, he said: "The excavation revealed that what had been a large earth mound contained within the Hillyard of Dingwall had been located within estuarine mud. "This confirmed George Brown's plan of 1790 showing the Hillyard as an estuarine islet." Radio carbon dating of earth samples indicated that the mound had been constructed in the estuary of the Peffery around the mid-11th Century. Mr MacDonald added: "That dating is consistent with the period in which, following his victory at Torfnes until his death, Earl Thorfinn the Mighty had exercised authority over Ross. "It therefore reasonably can be concluded that the mound had been constructed on Thorfinn's instructions to be a man-made islet adjacent to the eastern shore of what historically had been a small peninsula projecting into the estuary of the Peffery." Fragments of an iron vessel and imported medieval pottery were also found during the dig. </body>

      <body>Plans to redevelop a yard built in the 1970s to serve the North Sea oil and gas industry are to be considered by Highland councillors. Platforms for two oil fields and also sections of the Skye Bridge were constructed at Kishorn in Wester Ross. Kishorn Port Ltd proposes to make it a manufacturing base for the offshore renewables sector. The company said the redevelopment of the yard could lead to the creation of up to 2,500 jobs. Highland Council's north planning applications committee is to consider plans to extend the yard and increase operations at its quarry. Planning officers at the local authority have recommended granting permission. The council has received objections to the proposal. They raise concerns about noise and dust pollution and that an increase in industrial work at the site will threaten the environment and tourist trade. Among the new work proposed for the yard is the construction of concrete bases for offshore wind turbines. It has also been suggested blades and towers for turbines could be manufactured and assembled at Kishorn. The yard served the oil and gas industry until the late 1980s. At the height of its operation there were more than 3,000 people working there. Travel to the remote area of Wester Ross meant the workforce and also materials were brought in by sea or air. For a time two former cruise liners, the Rangatira and Odysseus, were moored in Loch Kishorn to provide accommodation for workers. The large concrete Ninian Field Central Platform was cast within the yard's dry dock and later floated into the loch. Once completed, the platform weighed 600,000 tonnes and was towed by seven tugs to the Ninian oilfield in the North Sea. At the time in 1978 it was the world's largest man-made moveable object. Kishorn went on to be used for the assembly of a metal platform for the Maureen oilfield and made the foundations for the Skye Bridge. </body>

      <body>An attack on three men who were stabbed during a fight in Glasgow's east end is being treated as attempted murder. The men were outside a close in Old Shettleston Road when they argued with two other men trying to access another close at 00:10 on Saturday. The two men crossed the road and stabbed all three before running off. The victims, two aged 28 and one aged 27, were taken to hospital. One was later released. The other two remain in serious but stable conditions. Police said the three victims were all taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary suffering from serious stab wounds. One of the 28-year-old men suffered a collapsed lung and is still detained in hospital. The other 28-year-old man suffered injuries to his groin and back and has since been released. The 27-year-old man sustained stabs wounds to his abdomen and arm and is still detained in hospital. The two men were carried out the attack were last seen running off west on Old Shettleston Road. Both of the suspects are described as white, Scottish, and aged between 18 and 25 years old. One of the men is described as about 5ft 11in, with broad shoulders. At the time of the attack he was wearing a blue hooded top with the hood up, and black tracksuit bottoms. The other suspect is described as about 5ft 8in tall and of medium build. He was wearing black clothing. Det Sgt Ross Jamieson, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a very nasty attack. "The men had been outside in a close for a smoke when for whatever reason they became involved in a shouting match with two men across the road which resulted in all three being viciously stabbed. "Although it happened in the early hours of the morning, this is a busy road and surrounded by flats and it is quite possible that someone saw or heard this attack take place."

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <body>Scottish Borders Council is being advised to award funds to help restore a giant three-dimensional map of Scotland in the village of Eddleston. Mapa Scotland has asked for Â£4,000 towards repair work on the map, built by Polish nationals in the 1970s. It was created to celebrate the links between Poland and Scotland and, especially, the contribution of Polish servicemen during World War II. SBC is being asked to agree funding to aid the upgrade works. The map was awarded B-listed status last year. It sits in an oval pool about 160ft (50m) wide and 5ft (1.5m) deep and once held gravity-fed water recreating rivers, lochs and seas. The map is currently the focus of a major restoration project in the grounds of the Barony Castle Hotel at Eddleston. The campaign to restore the map began in April 2010, when a group of volunteers constituted Mapa Scotland, a charitable trust which has secured Heritage Lottery funding to advance its plans. </body>

      <body>Fireworks worth about Â£65,000, that were meant for professional use, have been stolen from a storage unit near Hopetoun Estate, Linlithgow. About 4,800 fireworks in five steel containers were taken from 21cc Fireworks between Saturday and Monday. Police in West Lothian said the fireworks could be potentially lethal if used by members of the public. They urged anyone who saw anything suspicious over the weekend at Saw Mill, off the A904, to contact them. Those responsible for the theft are likely to have used a lorry to transport the fireworks. Det Sgt Paul Carroll, from Police Scotland, said: "The theft of such a large quantity of fireworks is concerning, not least because of their explosive content, and the potential for serious injury if mishandled. "The stolen fireworks are potentially lethal if used by members of the public, and we are warning people to be on the guard and only buy fireworks from reputable dealers." The stolen fireworks are Category 4 under the Fireworks Act 2003, which restricts their sale to fireworks professionals. </body>

      <body>Thousands of dental patients in Ayrshire are being notified about an investigation into poor infection control standards at two surgeries. NHS Ayrshire and Arran is writing to just over 5,600 patients who used the surgeries at Millbank Lane, Cumnock, and Mill O'Shields Road, Drongan. The health board said both surgeries belonged to the same practice. Its investigation concluded the risk of infection was very low and patients did not need to take further action. Dr Elvira Garcia, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Ayrshire and Arran, said: "We have worked closely with local and national experts in this investigation and we have jointly concluded that the risk of infection to patients is very low, and there is no need for patients to take any action. "However, we believe that patients have a right to know about this investigation, so we have written to them to ensure they are informed." The health board said that its investigation found that some of the infection control precautions used at both surgeries "did not consistently meet the high standards expected of dental practices". It asked the practice to close voluntarily while the investigation was carried out and improvements to infection control procedures were put in place. The health board said the practice had co-operated with the investigation and had re-opened, although it would continue to be monitored. Patients who require further information or assistance are asked to call the free telephone helpline: 0800 085 8531. Patients who believe they should receive a letter, but have not by 26 October, are asked to contact the helpline. </body>

      <body>An eight-year-old girl who was mauled by two American bulldogs in Glasgow is having flashbacks about the attack, her parents have revealed. Broagan McCuaig was playing with friends in Gartloch Road, Garthamlock, at about 17:10 on Friday when she was attacked by two American bulldogs. She received serious facial wounds and has had surgery on her face and leg. Her parents Tracy Cox and Neil McCuaig told BBC Scotland she was terrified and kept asking if "the dogs are away". The dogs, which have been seized by police, were being walked by their owner at the time of the attack. A man, aged 34, and a 33-year-old woman have been charged with offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Ms Cox described the moment she found her daughter being attacked. "She was playing with her friends when the next minute she was screaming and banging at the door," she said. "I could see at the back window these two big animals were pulling her from one to the other." Ms Cox said she saw some men trying to get the dogs off her daughter, then "blacked out". "I just froze," she said. "It was the worst day of my life. It's horrible to think one minute she's shouting and the next she's screaming 'help me'. That's all I can remember." "I thought it was going to be bad but she's pulling through. "She's just wanting to get home. She's getting flashbacks. It's all coming back to her so she's getting frightened now." The couple only moved to the flat four to five weeks ago. Ms Cox said: "She doesn't want to go back to that house. There are too many bad memories. She'll never be able to go out the back again because that's where it happened." Mr McCuaig said the dogs had recently "pounced" on him and his own dog but the owner had pulled them away. He said: "Nothing came of it but I wish it did now as they probably wouldn't be there when this happened to her. "It has had a terrifying impact. She keeps saying 'are the dogs away?'." Ms Cox said she believed the type of dogs involved should not be allowed to be kept in flats. "Those dogs are enormous," she said. "I'm really angry. Those dogs are for farms. They shouldn't be in a wee block of flats. There should be licences for these dogs. "It could've been a lot worse. I could have been sitting in a different place now." Ms Cox described her daughter as "a typical eight-year-old". She said: "She's out playing, cheeky, good one minute, bad the next. But she's popular and has a lot of friends. She's a good lassie. "I'm really proud of her. She's so brave." When asked about the dogs' owner, Ms Cox said: "The guilt is going to live with her forever. She has kids of her own. "As a mother I would understand how she's feeling because if it was the opposite way I'd be devastated that my animal did that." </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <body>Thousands of rabbits, including animals that caused a landslide that blocked a road, are to be culled on a small Hebridean island. National Trust for Scotland (NTS) estimates there are more than 16,000 rabbits on Canna. The burrowing animals have been blamed for causing a landslide that affected a main route on the isle and for damaging archaeological sites. NTS is to put out to tender a contract to control rabbit numbers. Work to exterminate rats on Canna was completed in 2008. Rats were blamed for eating the eggs and chicks of ground-nesting seabirds, seriously affecting their population. Pest controllers from New Zealand were brought in to deal with thousands of rats, using poison and traps. The rodents first arrived on the island on ships about 100 years ago. They had also posed a threat to the island's rare wood mice, 130 of which were transferred to Edinburgh Zoo before the cull. However, rabbits will not be completely wiped out because they provide food to eagles that nest on Canna. NTS said: "There are concerns about the impact that the population is having on the island, given the recent landslide. "Following advice from a specialist wildlife advisor, we are about to go out to tender for a contractor to undertake control work on the island. "The intention is that much of this work could be carried out before the end of the year. "The overall plan is to get the population down to manageable and sustainable levels." </body>

The Sea King from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, in Ayrshire, landed near the Kings House Hotel on 13 October. The machine was kept under armed guard until it was airlifted from the scene on Friday by a Chinook helicopter. It was understood the Sea King's four crew were on a training exercise when the pilots were alerted to a fault with the helicopter's gear box. It was lifted away from an area near the hotel to the village of Glencoe on Friday. It was then secured to a trailer and transported by lorry to HMS Gannet. The helicopter is one of three at HMS Gannet. Royal Navy crews and helicopters based at Prestwick are regularly called out to make searches and rescues in remote parts of Scotland. </body>

Al Kindi and the Whirling Dervishes of Damascus were due to open the festival on Friday but the group was refused entry visas by the Home Office. It is believed to be over doubts they would leave the UK after performing. The festival's director Fiona Robertson said the group regularly tour Europe so it was unfortunate news.

      <body>Aberdeen City Council has earmarked Â£20m to help transform the city centre, BBC Scotland has learned. However, following years of debate about how to make improvements, a final design has still not been drawn up. Businessman Sir Ian Wood has indicated that money from the Wood Family Trust could still be made available for a "transformational" project. Sir Ian originally offered Â£50m towards the Â£140m City Garden Project which was later rejected by the council. Apart from providing funding, the city council also hopes that Sir Ian will join a board created to come up with fresh proposals to redevelop the city centre. But the council's finance convenor, Willie Young, said the authority would press ahead with plans even without the guarantee of Sir Ian's money. He also said it would not be a second-class development if the entrepreneur did not come on board. Mr Young told BBC Scotland: "There will be other sources of funding. We will be speaking to the Scottish government, UK government and other businesses. "Just because Sir Ian Wood comes on board, or doesn't come on board, the city centre regeneration will happen." He added: "We want something that will deliver for the people of Aberdeen that won't divide the city. "What we've said is that there must be Victorian gardens within the city. Other than that we are happy to compromise. "What we are saying to Sir Ian Wood and to the business sector is 'if we are willing to compromise, you have to compromise as well'." New proposals by architect John Halliday have been put forward for a major renovation of Union Terrace Gardens. His design would see the gardens partly raised but remain sunken. The plans feature an arts centre, civic square, a new entrance to the railway station and the rail line and Denburn dual carriageway covered over to link to Belmont Street. </body>

The kitten, thought to be about eight weeks old, was found at bins on Tedder Road with her bed, litter tray, food and toys in a cardboard box. The Scottish SPCA said the kitten - now called Nala - had been "terrified". A spokeswoman said: "Nala was on top of the box and the lady who contacted us said her paws were tangled up in the tape that had been used to seal it." The kitten is now being cared for at the charity's Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Drumoak. Senior animal care assistant Jacki Bell said: "Nala has been through a lot and she's understandably terrified. "But she appears to be in good overall health and we hope to find her a loving home where she will be given the care and attention she deserves." </body>

      <body>A man involved a three-hour stand-off with police after dousing himself in petrol in a health centre has avoided a jail sentence. John McCarry, 50, was upset at a cut in his benefits when he threatened to set fire to himself and the building. A doctor raised the alarm and staff and patients were evacuated from Galashiels Health Centre in February this year. At Selkirk Sheriff Court, McCarry was given a six-month community payback order with a supervision requirement. He was also ordered to engage with the mental health organisation Penumbra. The court heard how McCarry had reacted angrily when Job Centre officials had declared him fit to work and told him he would be getting his benefits stopped. He headed straight for his home town's health centre where he went into a doctor's consulting room and poured a litre of petrol over his head. McCarry then held a half-full plastic bottle in one hand and a lighter in the other. After the building was evacuated, it was surrounded by the emergency services. A three-hour stand-off then followed before specially-trained negotiators finally convinced McCarry to give up the bottle containing petrol and throw the lighter to the ground. He had previously admitted committing a breach of the peace at the health centre. </body>

      <body>Two men have been accused of endangering lives by causing a house fire after they removed power cables. Silvin Andrei, 28, and Ion Ozon, 32, of Birmingham, are alleged to have stolen external cables connected to a house in Inchture, Perthshire on 15 October. The theft caused an electrical fault which sparked a fire in the house where people were sleeping. The pair made no plea or declaration when they appeared at Perth Sheriff Court. They were remanded in custody. Both men, who are from Romania, are also alleged to have stolen a quantity of cable from Exton House on the same date. They are further alleged to have stolen a quantity of cable from Milton of Forteviot Farm, Forteviot, between 16 and 17 October. The pair, who appeared from custody, are further alleged to have stolen a quantity of cable from South Lodge, Dupplin, Perthshire, on 18 October. Mr Andrei and Mr Ozon are also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice on 18 October by running off from police who were trying to detain them in South Inch Terrace, Perth. </body>

      <body>A former nursery worker has admitted being involved in the distribution of indecent images of children. Danny Kilburn, 21, from Glenrothes, was found with a total of 11,617 indecent images of children and 340 videos. He also admitted taking or permitting others to take indecent images of children at his home in Dundee. Kilburn was placed on the sex offenders register and released on bail pending the preparation of reports at Perth Sheriff Court. He had been working at the Oranges and Lemons Nursery in Dundee for more than a year when police discovered the material. He boasted online about abusing a girl in his care, and when police raided his home he was found to have more than 11,000 images of children being abused. The court heard how Kilburn had been distributing the material from his former home between 22 January and 9 October 2012. He had also taken or permitted to taking the indecent images of children at his home between 3 September 2011 and 7 October 2012. Fiscal depute Carol Whyte told Perth Sheriff Court: "On 2 October 2012, Tayside Police received information from other police forces indicating that indecent images had been accessed. "The owner of the equipment had been communicating on chat rooms with like-minded people and had indicated that he worked in a local nursery and was abusing a female child from the premises. "The man also boasted on the chat room site that he had a sexual interest in children whom he regularly abused. The man used the pseudonym Dan Dan when involved in the chat room. "The information was treated seriously and urgent inquiries were carried out to trace the computer owner. The equipment being used was traced to the accused's home address. "On 9 October 2012 a team of police officers went to the house and found the accused and his entire family present." Two laptops, three memory sticks and a mobile phone were seized. Ms Whyte said: "He told the police that they would find indecent images of children on laptop computers, memory sticks and a mobile phone which were owned by him and kept in the family home. "The accused admitted file sharing the indecent material with other people and discussing sexually abusing children with people in chat rooms. "He claimed all this activity had taken place over the course of a maximum timescale of a year. "He could give no explanation as to why he did this other than to say it was for the adrenalin rush he got by doing something he knew was wrong. "He denied he had ever sexually abused children in the nursery where he worked. The police inquiry did not find any evidence of such abuse and it seems the accused's claims in the chat rooms were an act of bravado." Parents of children at the nursery were informed by letter that a member of staff had been suspended pending the outcome of a police investigation. Kilburn was then sacked. Among his collection were hundreds of images and 16 videos rated as level five - the worst on the scale. The court was told that it was difficult to quantify how much of the material had been distributed onwards by Kilburn, but it was at least 200 images. Kilburn has been banned from being alone with children and using any device which can access the internet while on bail. </body>

      <title>Union rejects teaching changes</title>
      <description>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions</description>

      <body>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions. EIS members voted against the changes by 59% to 41% in a consultative ballot. The proposals included greater flexibility over working, and changes to the things teachers should and should not be responsible for. There were also some changes to the list of agreed duties of things which should or should not be done by teachers. The EIS expects the current pay offer for teachers to now be withdrawn. The proposed changes were negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) following the publication of the McCormac Report on teacher employment. Among the proposals were greater flexibility over working time. For example a teacher might spend two hours more with students one week but have two hours less the next to balance this out. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has been consistent in stating that any proposals arising from discussion of the McCormac report would be subject to a ballot of our members. "We have now completed that process and the result is a clear rejection by Scotland's teachers of the suggested changes to working conditions. "As always, the EIS is listening to its members and will make teachers' views known to the management side at the forthcoming meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers". The union said the rejection of the proposed changes to working conditions is also likely to have an impact on the agreed 1% pay offer for teachers in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Local government body Cosla had indicated that the 1% pay offer could be withdrawn if teachers rejected the changes to working conditions. The current pay offer also included improvements to the payment for short term supply teachers, a move being funded by the Scottish government. Mr Flanagan added: "We will be seeking constructive dialogue with both Cosla and Scottish government on what happens next. "No one wishes to see disruption in our schools, particularly at such a crucial phase in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, so we will await discussion of the issues at the SNCT before deciding how to proceed. "The ballot result, however, is indicative of the mood of teachers who after a two year pay freeze, increased pension contributions and in the face of excessive workload have simply said, 'Enough is enough.'" Councillor Billy Hendry, Cosla's human resources spokesman, said: "Firstly I am disappointed with the outcome of the EIS ballot. Secondly I am very disappointed that our teaching workforce will now not have their back dated pay in their pay packets before Christmas. "The simple fact is that as employers we have put together the very best components of an offer in agreement with the unions and the Scottish government. "The offer is a package and is not open to any one of the three parties to cherry pick the bits that they like best and reject the rest. "This offer remains on the table and will do so during our meeting with the EIS tomorrow." Education Secretary Michael Russell said: "I am disappointed that EIS members have voted to reject the proposals. "Obviously the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) will have to look at this matter as a matter of urgency when they meet tomorrow." </body>

      <body>People across Scotland should begin preparations for severe winter weather, the Scottish government has urged. The message comes as Transport Minster Keith Brown launches the Ready for Winter campaign. Mr Brown stressed that preparations for extreme weather events were good, but some motorists still did not plan enough for severe conditions. The new campaign also encourages people to look out for others, especially the more vulnerable. It includes findings from a survey carried out jointly by the British Red Cross and the Scottish government. It showed an increase in public preparedness for extreme weather, with most people concerned about power cuts and being cut off from their water supply. However, it revealed many car owners thought they were doing enough just by having an ice scraper and de-icer. In the past few years, parts of Scotland have been hit by high winds, blizzards and severe sub-zero temperatures. Mr Brown said: "With the clocks changing next week, the campaign calls on everyone to use the extra hour to get ready in the home, before a journey, at our place of work and in our communities. "This will serve us well not just throughout the winter months, but all year round and in a range of emergency situations. "As we have seen in Scotland, severe weather can strike quickly and at any time of year. In March, we saw the impact of severe snowstorms on communities in Arran, Kintyre and Dumfries and Galloway." The Ready for Winter campaign includes a range of online resources, TV, radio and social media material. Online advice can be accessed at the Ready Scotland website. </body>

      <title>Corroboration 'must go' for justice</title>
      <description>Scotland's justice secretary voices his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources, despite opposition.</description>

      <body>Scotland's justice secretary has voiced his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources. Kenny MacAskill told the SNP conference dropping the centuries-old requirement for corroboration meant people would no longer have to suffer in silence. Sections of the legal profession oppose the move and the SNP's Christine Grahame has urged caution. But Mr MacAskill said criminal law had to be brought into the 21st Century. Proposals to drop the general requirement for corroboration are part of a series of justice reforms which have been put forward by the Scottish government. Supporters say the plan could improve conviction rates in areas such as sex crime and domestic abuse cases. But opponents argue corroboration provides an important safeguard against miscarriages of justice. Addressing delegates in Perth, Mr MacAskill said: "We need to address the historic anomaly of the routine requirement for corroboration. "Those who suffer rape and other serious sexual assault are denied justice by it. "But it's not just the victims of these horrendous sexual crimes, but many others, whether children or the elderly - crimes committed without eyewitnesses." The justice secretary went on: "Of the latest shameful statistics on domestic abuse, 10% of crimes reported to the Crown couldn't be prosecuted because of the lack of corroboration. "And those were only the ones the police reported - many others didn't even make it to the fiscal's office as they knew the Crown couldn't pursue them." Mr MacAskill said the abolition of corroboration would come hand-in-hand with additional safeguards including a "qualitative and quantitive" test for prosecutions and increasing the majority required by juries for a conviction. He said: "Justice there must be and corroboration must go." Ms Grahame, convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party justice committee, which is scrutinising the government's proposals, has warned any changes must be for the benefit of the complainer and accused, not because they are "politically popular". </body>

      <title>Union members reject Grangemouth offer</title>
      <description>Unite union claims about half the permanent workforce at the Grangemouth complex have rejected new terms put forward by site operator Ineos.</description>

      <body>Half the permanent workforce at the Grangemouth complex have rejected new terms and conditions proposed by Ineos, union officials have said. The Unite union said that, by the 18:00 deadline, it had been given 665 forms rejecting the offer on pay and pensions out of a workforce of 1,350. Site operator Ineos said it would meet on Tuesday to discuss its options. It has warned the plant would close in 2017 without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. The firm had said it received about 300 positive returns for the pay offer by Sunday. However, the union had asked its 1,035 members at Grangemouth not to hand the forms to Ineos. It has accused the company of giving workers an ultimatum of accepting worse pay and conditions or losing their job. The 2.6 square-mile refinery and petrochemical site was shut down ahead of a planned strike by Unite members. It remains closed despite the 48-hour strike, which had been due to begin on Sunday, being called off. The union has now promised no strikes and said it was prepared to negotiate. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. Calum MacLean, chairman of Ineos Grangemouth, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the company had received "around 300" forms by Sunday. Mr MacLean said he "remained pretty confident" there would be strong support for the company from workers. He added: "Getting the plant back up and running again is not about necessarily the number of people, albeit that will influence when we can start it. "What is important here is that we have asked the unions to give us an assurance that there will be no strike action during the consultation period, which is the 45 to 60 days when we are going to sit down and negotiate with the employees and talk about the changes we are trying to impose. "People need to realise that this site has lost Â£150m per year for the last four years. It has got a pension fund which is Â£200m in deficit and it is on the point of going bust. "If it wasn't because of the support of the shareholders, who are funding those losses, then there is a very, very serious situation here which means the site may not start up again". Ineos has put forward what it calls a survival plan for Grangemouth. These changes were detailed in letters sent to staff at the end of last week. They include freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support its survival plan at this stage will receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Unite said it had strongly advised its members at Grangemouth not to return the forms backing the changes to their contract. It accused Ineos of "bribes and blackmail". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, told Good Morning Scotland: "We have continuously given assurances of no strikes from now up until December. "In fact yesterday (Sunday), when we had a rally here, I gave a commitment that we would have no strikes for however long it took to allow negotiations to take place between ourselves and Ineos on the survival plan. We are not imposing any conditions. "Ineos wants to come to the negotiating table at the same time as threatening our members and threatening people here with the sack in 45 days. You can't negotiate and impose at the same time." First Minister Alex Salmond repeated his calls for Ineos to "fire up the plant" and for Unite to commit to a "no strike - without strings - guarantee" at the SNP conference in Perth. Ineos shareholders are due to discuss the future of the complex on Tuesday. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, who is scheduled to meet with Ineos later this week, urged the company to "withdraw the ultimatums delivered to the workforce". She said: "The company should also undertake to immediately reopen the plant and return to production and both the union and the company should return to meaningful talks, with Acas if necessary, to deliver a solution to this matter which has serious consequences for Scotland and the UK." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <title>Pay 'on the rise' for new recruits</title>
      <description>The latest Bank of Scotland jobs report shows pay rising for new recruits and continued improvement in permanent and temporary placements.</description>

      <body>Pay for new recruits is on the rise, according to the latest market report from Bank of Scotland. There has also been a continued improvement in permanent and temporary placements, with the strongest prospects in Aberdeen. In other economic news, retailers saw a downturn in shopping last month. But, the Scottish Retail Consortium said this may be because household budgets were being managed cautiously ahead of the Christmas spend. Statistics published last week provided more evidence that pay increases for those in employment were falling behind inflation. The Bank of Scotland's jobs report for September suggested the answer may be to shift to a new job. Starting pay rose at the fastest pace in six years, and hourly pay for temporary jobs increased at a sharp pace too. Scottish recruiters reported a further increase in the number of candidates placed into permanent work in September. The rate of growth was marked, despite having eased from the survey-highs in the previous two months. About 40% of panellists placed a larger number of candidates into permanent work since August, and often linked this to greater client demand, the report said. The Bank of Scotland's labour market barometer picked up slightly in September, rising to 60.0 from 59.7 in August. The barometer is measured against a baseline of 50, with anything above that number representing an improvement in market conditions. Any number below 50 means a deterioration. With continued improvement in labour market conditions, vacancies grew most strongly in engineering and construction during September. Aberdeen saw the strongest growth in recruitment and the fastest rise in starting pay, thanks to big investments by oil and gas firms. Donald MacRae, chief economist at Bank of Scotland, said: "September's Labour Market Barometer showed a continuing improvement in Scottish job market conditions. "The number of people appointed to both permanent and temporary jobs increased while growth in vacancies was marked. "The Engineering and Construction sectors saw the highest rate of vacancy growth for almost two-and-a-half years. This is further welcome evidence of the strengthening of the recovery in the Scottish economy." Meanwhile, latest figures from the Scottish Retail Consortium provided evidence of an autumn stall in recovery for the high street and shopping centres. In September, shopper numbers in Scotland were 2.7% lower than a year ago - and down on the 0.3% decline seen in August 2013. For the UK as a whole footfall was down 2.7%. Fiona Moriarty, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: "It's disappointing to see Scottish shopper numbers have dropped significantly after a solid result in August. "While recent months have hinted at economic recovery, many of us are still cautious about making major purchases and may want to focus on managing budgets ahead of Christmas." She added: "There's been better news in recent weeks, with signs that customers are responding well to autumn collections and thoughts are turning to the festive season. "Retailers in Scotland will continue to monitor conditions closely as they gear up for the crucial Christmas trading period." </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra Â£137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to Â£1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <body>Former Celtic midfielder Peter Grant believes the Scottish champions have to beat Ajax on Tuesday if they are to have a realistic hope of reaching the Champions League knock-out stages. Manager Neil Lennon, however, believes a draw in Glasgow would still give them a chance of progression as he feels Celtic can win in Amsterdam. "I think it's a must-win game and I think Celtic will win," said Grant. "When you see the games coming up it would gives them a great boost." Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Grant, who played for Celtic from 1982 until 1997 and who later served as the club's assistant manager, added: "There's nothing worse than having played three games and you still haven't won one. "I think they have a fantastic chance to do it. Ajax are a very good side but they are very inexperienced. "There's not a lot of European experience, never mind Champions League experience." Celtic are at the foot of Group H, without a point from their away match against AC Milan and their Parkhead defeat by Barcelona. Ajax are in third place in the group with one point ahead of the double-header against Lennon's side. Grant is aware that Celtic are missing team captain Scott Brown through suspension and Kris Commons with injury, while defender Mikael Lustig faces a fitness test and Wales midfielder Joe Ledley is short of match sharpness. However, he thinks the strength of the squad and the passion of the fans can produce three points for the home side. "I still think they have the quality," said Grant, 48. "I think Ledley has been a big player for them. I know he only played 20 minutes at the weekend but his quality always tells. "Celtic Park always gives you a lift, with the fans behind you and playing on the big occasion always brings the best out in the players. They don't feel the tiredness. You want to play in all these big games. "Ajax won't surprise you with the way they play. They will try to keep the ball. "They have some wonderful players - Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, the striker, and Siem de Jong are very good - but they are very inexperienced; they are a very young side and they won't have played in an atmosphere like Celtic Park on a European night. "I know what the Celtic fans are like knowing it's a game, I believe, that they need to win."

      <title>Johnson's squad builds to World Cup</title>
      <description>Scotland coach Scott Johnson says his autumn internationals squad has been picked with the 2015 Rugby World Cup in mind.</description>

      <body>Scott Johnson says he has picked a training squad for the autumn internationals with the 2015 Rugby World Cup in mind. The interim Scotland head coach has named five uncapped players in his 41-man squad for the games against Japan, South Africa and Australia next month. "We want to continue building a depth to the squad," he told BBC Scotland at Murrayfield. "I have a duty of care to do that 24 months out from the World Cup." Mark Bennett, Jonny Gray and Chris Fusaro have been rewarded for Glasgow Warriors' impressive start to the season with a call-up for next week's training sessions in Glasgow ahead of the three Tests. And London Irish back-row pair Kieran Low, 22, and Blair Cowan, 27, are also called up as they, too, hope to win their first caps. "I've been impressed with what I've seen from Mark Bennett and Jonny Gray," added Johnson. "They've been consistent, which is often a challenge for younger players, and they've shown the resolve to get better." Scotland play Japan on 9 November, then welcome South Africa on 17 November and Australia six days later. Bennett, Gray and Fusaro are just three of 18 Warriors to make the squad, which also features 10 players from Edinburgh and 13 players from England, France and Wales. Johnson, who has surprisingly left out the Glasgow flanker Tyrone Holmes after his man-of-the-match performance in the Heineken Cup last Sunday, said he has had no contact from fly-half Tommaso Allan despite calling him on Monday morning. Allan has represented Scotland at age-grade level but is in the Italy training squad for their November Tests. Scotland training squad for autumn Tests: Backs: Mark Bennett (Glasgow Warriors), Chris Cusiter (Glasgow Warriors), Nick De Luca (Edinburgh), Alex Dunbar (Glasgow Warriors), Max Evans (Castres), Tom Heathcote (Bath), Ruaridh Jackson (Glasgow Warriors), Sean Lamont (Glasgow Warriors), Greig Laidlaw (Edinburgh), Sean Maitland (Glasgow Warriors), Henry Pyrgos (Glasgow Warriors), Matt Scott (Edinburgh), Tommy Seymour (Glasgow Warriors), Duncan Taylor (Saracens), Greig Tonks (Edinburgh), Tim Visser (Edinburgh), Duncan Weir (Glasgow Warriors) Forwards: John Barclay (Scarlets), John Beattie (Montpellier), Kelly Brown (Saracens), Blair Cowan (London Irish), Geoff Cross (Edinburgh), David Denton (Edinburgh), Alasdair Dickinson (Edinburgh), Ross Ford (Edinburgh), Chris Fusaro (Glasgow Warriors), Grant Gilchrist (Edinburgh), Ryan Grant (Glasgow Warriors), Jonny Gray (Glasgow Warriors), Richie Gray (Castres), Jim Hamilton (Montpellier), Rob Harley (Glasgow Warriors), Alastair Kellock (Glasgow Warriors), Scott Lawson (Newcastle Falcons), Kieran Low (London Irish), Moray Low (Glasgow Warriors), Pat MacArthur (Glasgow Warriors), Euan Murray (Worcester Warriors), Alasdair Strokosch (Perpignan), Tim Swinson (Glasgow Warriors), Jon Welsh (Glasgow Warriors) </body>

      <body>Celtic have confirmed that playmaker Kris Commons will miss the Champions League visit by Ajax with a hamstring injury picked up on Saturday. Mikael Lustig faces a late fitness test after missing the draw at Hibernian with a hip injury, but fellow full-back Emilio Izaguirre returns from illness. Midfielder Joe Ledley might not be fit enough to play the full 90 minutes in place of suspended captain Scott Brown. Derk Boerrigter, Adam Matthews and Steve Moyoukolo remain out. Celtic manager Neil Lennon is hopeful that in-form Commons' injury will heal in time for the return match in Amsterdam on 6 November. "We are hoping it's not as bad as a tear, but he will be out for tomorrow," he said. "He's been for a scan and we're awaiting confirmation. "He may make the corresponding game in Amsterdam." Wales international Ledley made his first appearance since 14 September when coming on as a substitute during the 1-1 draw in Edinburgh. "He only played 20 minutes on Saturday after a month out, so it's debatable if he could play 90 minutes," said Lennon. The absence of winger Derk Boerrigter means Lennon lacks midfield resources, while Steve Moyoukolo's long-term injury also reduces Celtic's options in defence. They played at Easter Road with Charlie Mulgrew replacing Izaguirre at left-back and 19-year-old Darnell Fisher making his debut at right-back in the absence of Lustig and Matthews. "Emilio will be fine, Mikael we will assess tomorrow, but we're pretty hopeful he will be fit," said Lennon. "They both trained today." However, Lennon thought Fisher could fill in against Ajax if necessary. "For a debut, it was very composed and mature," added the manager. "We were delighted with him. It gives us confidence in him." </body>

      <title>Get weaving: Forgotten skill kept alive</title>
      <description>Forgotten jute and linen skills kept alive</description>

      <body>Thousands of people used to work in the linen and jute mills of Angus and Dundee but today it is largely consigned to the history books. Now a youth project in Forfar is introducing the almost forgotten skill of weaving to young people - and it is having the unexpected effect of improving community relations. From the 19th century thousands of men, women and children were employed in weaving - on hand looms and then in the factories. At its height, in the late 19th century, Dundee boasted about 60 jute mills and more than 50,000 workers were employed by the city's jute industry. Today weaving has almost completely disappeared. But this project is about much more than just remembering how it used to be, according to Dawn Mullady, the project worker at The Pitstop in Forfar. She says. "We have many generations working together on the project, which is unbelievably fantastic. "The joy of the project is that young people's eyes light up when the older generation come in to teach. "The older generation's eyes light up when they see the enthusiasm of the young people, so it's a win-win situation and it's a fantastic way of documenting what Forfar weavers' lifestyles were." Twenty-one-year-old Adele Douglas learns all about the intricacies of weaving at the Pitstop project. She says it is "magical". "I look at the older generation and think 'were you a weaver?," she says. "Was that woman a weaver or does she walk like a weaver or talk like a weaver? "I always think of that because it's them that made the history with weaving, we're just learning. "We could pass it down to our kids and our kids could probably pass it down to their kids. Yeah, I always think of the older generation differently now." Rab McMonagle has worked in the weaving industry for 34 years. He says: "When I started I was doing jute. I worked in the finishing department. I worked in the weaving department and then I went back to the finishing department." He now also helps teach the young people at The Pitstop project. Ron Scrimgeour is a member of the Nine Trades of Dundee. He is keen to keep the weaving heritage alive through work with projects like this. He says: "The whole area - Angus and Dundee - had thousands and thousands of people working in the mills, and, largely because it was considered an inferior trade, people kind of kept quiet about it. "Whereas people are now discovering that their grannies were weavers or spinners or winders and they're taking a pride in that. "And that's actually a major achievement for the weaver craft, that's one of the things that we like to do, is to keep the traditions and the heritage going." </body>

According to the Herald, a union has warned of a "tightening of the knot" in its dispute with Grangemouth's owners, who are expected to announce today how they will respond to an apparent rejection of their plans to change employment conditions at the complex. The Courier explains that two-thirds of workers at the Grangemouth oil refinery have refused to accept new terms and conditions as part of a survival plan for the site's future, according to the union. The Daily Record features the story of Broagan McCuaig, an eight-year-old from Glasgow who was mauled by American bulldogs.

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May says vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea". The campaign had resulted in the return of some illegal immigrants but it was too much of a "blunt instrument," she added. Speaking in the Commons, at the second reading of the government's Immigration Bill, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid", and Labour accused the government of aping language used by the far-right National Front in the 1970s. UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted that the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it to other parts of the country. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said he was "very pleased" the idea was being axed, describing it as "deeply inappropriate". Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett told the same programme the pilot had failed and the evidence showed it had made no difference to legitimate efforts to tackle illegal immigration. A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <title>UK aims to claw back EU welfare cash</title>
      <description>The UK is examining ways to claim back cash for welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries, the BBC understands.</description>

      <body>The UK is examining ways to claw back welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries from their home government, the BBC understands. A levy could be put in place so that for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, the government would be able to reclaim any benefits paid out. The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was "possible to return to the system". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a "right to reside" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be "habitually resident". Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims "might not raise huge sums," the senior Foreign Office source said, "but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring. In January 2014, restrictions that have applied to migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK will expire. Meanwhile, the UK is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK. It is alleged the extra UK "right to reside" test to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. The government has said it will fight the court case robustly. Ministers are keen to be seen to be adopting a muscular approach to immigration, given how big a priority opinion polls suggest it is to many voters, and the recent strong performances of the UK Independence Party. </body>

      <description>David Cameron brands Facebook irresponsible for allowing beheading videos to appear on its site without warnings.</description>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has waded into an escalating row about Facebook's decision to allow videos showing people being decapitated back on its pages. He tweeted that it was "irresponsible" of the social network to post such videos without warning. Facebook reversed a temporary ban on such videos, saying users should be free to watch and condemn such content. The move was also condemned by one of the website's advertisers. The row gained momentum when Mr Cameron tweeted: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Car-sharing firm Zipcar told the BBC it was disappointed that its adverts had appeared next to one of the videos. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. The BBC was alerted to the fact that such content was back online by a reader who said the firm was refusing to remove a page showing a clip of a masked man killing a woman, which is believed to have been filmed in Mexico. It was posted last week under the title, Challenge: Anybody can watch this video? The social network later confirmed it was allowing such material to be posted again. "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," said a spokeswoman. "However, since some people object to graphic video of this nature, we are working to give people additional control over the content they see. This may include warning them in advance that the image they are about to see contains graphic content." But the decision has been criticised by its own advisors and law enforcers. The chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, Stephen Balkam - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "surprised" and "unhappy" at the move and would be contacting the firm to make clear his concerns. After being contacted by a member of the local community, the South Australia Police (Sapol) force has also registered a complaint with Facebook about a video showing the decapitation of a woman. Facebook advised Sapol it would not be removing the video. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Facebook advised us that they had reviewed the video and found, 'It did not violate our community standard on graphic violence'. Our team then spoke with a representative of Facebook about the decision, but were advised that the video would remain in place as a platform for community debate. "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." </body>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. The chairman of the committee, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. </body>

      <title>Syria talks 'must bolster moderates'</title>
      <description>The UK foreign secretary urges Arab and Western nations to encourage unity among Syria's moderate opposition and keep out extremists, at talks in London.</description>

      <body>Bolstering Syria's moderate opposition is crucial to excluding extremists from power in the war-gripped country, the UK's foreign secretary has said. William Hague was speaking as Arab and Western foreign ministers gathered for talks with Syrian opposition officials. The London talks are trying to lay the groundwork for planned peace negotiations in Geneva next month. But a key group in Syria's main opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the meeting dubbed Geneva II. The Syrian National Council (SNC) has been unwilling to talk to representatives of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ministers will say unity is vital among the fractured groups of Syria's armed and political opposition if peace talks are to have any chance of success. In London, foreign ministers from 11 countries - the so-called Friends of Syria group - are trying to encourage opposition groups "to have a united position" ahead of Geneva II, Mr Hague told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Hague admitted that an increasingly prominent role was being played in Syria by Islamist rebels linked to al-Qaeda, who are engaged in no kind of peace process and who have been involved in bitter struggles with more moderate forces. "The reason we have to make sure we are supporting and dealing with the moderate opposition committed to a democratic, pluralistic, non-sectarian future for Syria is precisely because if they don't have a role, then all the Syrian people have got left is a choice between Assad and extremists," Mr Hague said. "The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes. That's why we're making a renewed effort" with Geneva II, Mr Hague said. At Tuesday's talks, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to reaffirm their view that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the Assad regime. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague said he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role" - but that required Iran to back a "transitional government in Syria made up of regime and opposition, by mutual consent". Earlier, the US Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that Syria's opposition would never agree to President Assad staying in power. "He has bombed and gassed people in his country. How can that man claim to rule under any legitimacy in the future?" he said, dismissing suggestions that Mr Assad could stand for re-election in 2014. But President Assad reportedly told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen in comments reported by AFP news agency. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. On Monday, the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, said it was postponing until early November meetings to decide whether to attend the Geneva II conference. The opposition has been further weakened by fighting between the moderate Free Syrian Army and Islamist rebel groups. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort in Syria, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. The National Coalition has insisted that President Assad play no role in a transitional authority - something the Syrian government has rejected. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested Â£150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBCâ¦ was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around Â£5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost Â£2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new Â£150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <body>MPs are debating government plans to toughen up the immigration system by making landlords question tenants about their status and cutting bank account access for those in the UK illegally. Ministers also want to make it easier to deport foreign criminals and cut the number of grounds for appeal. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the changes will put the system "on the side" of those who abide by the law. But Labour has tabled several amendments to the Immigration Bill. The government's plans, announced earlier this month, include: The bill is undergoing its second reading debate, during which MPs discuss the main principles. The government says it will help the aim of reducing net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to fewer than 100,000 a year. But Labour said the bill offered "nothing" to deal with exploitation of illegal workers or problems at border controls. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will propose several amendments, including: There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000, but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was closer to 1.1 million. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save Â£500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS Â£2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra Â£500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a Â£200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise Â£200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between Â£60m and Â£80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is Â£20m-Â£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further Â£50m-Â£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" Â£500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just Â£73m a year is recouped out of more than Â£460m at present. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the proposed new levy would apply to all non-EEA nationals - regardless of whether their country has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's Â£500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed Â£200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than Â£200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <title>Email error revealed inmate details</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Justice is fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to the families of three prisoners.</description>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <body>Energy Secretary Ed Davey has defended building the UK's first nuclear station in a generation as "a very good deal for Britain". French giant EDF will lead a consortium to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. But environmentalists said the money could be better spent on renewables. The government estimates that energy bills will be Â£77 lower by 2030, but Mr Davey could not guarantee this because of the "uncertainties". Hinkley currently produces about 1% of the UK's total energy, but this is expected to rise to 7% once the expansion is complete in 2023. The consortium and the government have agreed a "strike price" of Â£92.50 for every megawatt hour, almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. This will fall to Â£89.50 for every megawatt hour of energy if EDF Group goes ahead with plans to develop a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. Doing both would allow EDF to share costs across both projects. "In terms of the per-megawatt hour price - which is what people are talking about today - the solar industry is asking for less than what the nuclear industry's getting," said Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr. "They will be producing power cheaper than nuclear by the time Hinkley comes on stream. So we don't think this represents good value for money when we're locking in those price levels for 35 years." Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins the next election, said the party supported the development of new nuclear power stations, but would scrutinise the terms of the deal to ensure it delivered value for money for consumers. "We've got the prime minister who says he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies but he can't freeze prices now for the consumer. No wonder we've got a cost of living crisis in this country," he added. Mr Davey said: "We're facing a looming energy crisis. "If people at home want to be able to keep watching the television, be able to turn the kettle on, and benefit from electricity, we have got to make these investments. "It is essential to keep the lights on and to power British business.'' The government estimates that with new nuclear power - including Hinkley - the average energy bill in 2030 will be Â£77 lower than it would have been without the new plants. Mr Davey plans to submit the UK's application for state aid clearance to the European Commission for the new nuclear power plant later this week, "I'm confident we will manage to argue our case," Mr Davey said. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz called the deal "good, fair and balanced for consumers, the UK and EDF". The two reactors planned for Hinkley, which will provide power for about 60 years, are a key part of the coalition's drive to shift the UK away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon power. Ministers and EDF have been in talks for more than a year about the minimum price the company will be paid for electricity produced at the site, which the government estimates will cost Â£16bn to build. Green MP Caroline Lucas described it as a "terrible deal for billpayers" and called for the National Audit Office to investigate the value for money of the government's deal. Mr Davey said the deal was "competitive" with other large-scale clean energy and gas projects. "While consumers won't pay anything up front, they'll share directly in any gains made from the project coming in under budget," he added. Angela Knight, chief executive of trade body Energy UK, said that, given the UK would not have to pay anything until Hinkley Point C produced energy - expected in 2023 - there was time to act to reduce energy use. "We've got 10 years in which to insulate our homes better. We've got 10 years to take the steps that some other countries have taken - especially those in colder countries - to make sure that we can keep warm but use less," she said. However, Friends of the Earth's policy and campaigns director Craig Bennett said the agreement meant "locking the UK into costly nuclear power for decades". "The quickest way to end our costly fossil fuel dependency is through energy efficiency and renewable power, not new reactors that will suck up precious investment and take years to complete," he said. Dr Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London, said "what it equates to actually is a subsidy and the coalition said they would never subsidise nuclear". He added: "It is essentially a subsidy of between what we calculate to be Â£800m to Â£1bn a year that the UK taxpayer and energy consumer will be putting into the deep pockets of Chinese and French corporations, which are essentially their governments." Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation will be minority shareholders in the project. The move follows Chancellor George Osborne's announcement last week that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. The announcement is not legally binding and it will be 2014 before EDF makes a final investment decision on the project. But it comes as concerns about domestic energy bills move up the agenda, with SSE, British Gas and Npower, three of the UK's "big six" gas and electricity suppliers, all having announced price increases. About 25,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction of the power plant, as well as 900 permanent jobs during its 60-year operation. </body>

      <description>Three police officers apologise for their "poor judgement" in briefing the media about the "plebgate" scandal.</description>

      <body>Three police officers have apologised for their "poor judgement" in briefing the media about the "plebgate" scandal. Ken MacKaill, Stuart Hinton, and Chris Jones said they had not planned to mislead the public. They came under scrutiny when ex-cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said he had a transcript which contradicted their account of a meeting with him. Mr Mitchell lost his job after being accused of calling officers "plebs" - a charge he has always denied. Insp MacKaill from West Mercia Police, Det Sgt Hinton from Warwickshire Police, and Sgt Jones from West Midlands Police said they had decided to issue a statement "in response to public concern generated by the widely reported outcome of West Mercia's investigation into matters arising from the meeting". The statement continued: "The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us. "We acknowledge the investigation's criticism relating to our poor judgement in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise. "We would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise." But the BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said friends of Mr Mitchell - some of whom have accused the officers of lying - regarded the statement as "a regrettable non apology". The MP resigned from the cabinet after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held on 12 October 2012, three weeks after the incident in Downing Street. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. The police forces concerned have decided to take no action against the officers following an internal investigation, saying there was insufficient evidence to do so. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which supervised the probe, said the trio's actions had brought their "honesty and integrity" into question. The watchdog said a misconduct panel should be held to determine whether the officers gave a false account in a deliberate attempt to discredit Mr Mitchell in pursuit of a wider political agenda against police service cuts. Mr Mitchell has not launched a formal complaint against the officers concerned but MPs from all parties have said the episode has damaged public trust in the police. Home Secretary Theresa May has said she believes disciplinary proceedings should be started against the officers, while David Cameron has urged the police forces to apologise to Mr Mitchell. The chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands are set to be questioned by MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday about their role in the affair. They are facing allegations that they effectively overruled a proposal to charge their own men with misconduct. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering whether to bring charges over the original incident outside Downing Street. Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the row. </body>

      <title>Don't cut our expenses, say MPs</title>
      <description>A powerful group of MPs rejects a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses for hotels, second homes, TVs, taxis and tea and biscuits.</description>

      <body>A powerful MPs' group has rejected a plan by Parliament's financial watchdog to cut expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wants to ban claims for tea and biscuits and installing televisions in second homes. It also proposes cutting costs on hotel bills and evening meals. But the Commons Standards Committee insists that other professionals would be able to claim such expenses in compensation for unsociable hours. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was set up following the MPs' expenses scandal of 2009 and it has frequently come into conflict with those whose behaviour it was set up to police. In its latest report, it proposed MPs should get a Â£7,000 pay rise. But it said they should no longer be able to claim for: Ipsa says these perks cost the taxpayer Â£161,000 in 2011/12, about Â£250 per MP, and that most professional people would be expected to pay for them themselves. But the Standards Committee, in its formal submission to Ipsa's consultation, disagrees, saying MPs are like police, solicitors and junior doctors and should be able to claim expenses in compensation for "regular unsocial hours or residence away from home". It adds: "Practices vary widely within and between professions. In some professions there is indeed no reimbursement for unsocial hours and the associated costs of those hours but salaries may be supplemented to compensate." The committee is asking Ipsa to "establish an evidence base for the proposals", adding: "We do not consider that Ipsa has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses." It says: "We find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 0100 before booking a hotel." On the curb on taxis before 2300, the committee says: "We are also concerned about the effects of such rules on members' ability to perform their duties effectively. "We note that many committees begin work at 08.55, and members are expected to attend regardless of the hour at which they ended their work the night before." And on the ban on claims for getting a TV installed, it says: "Since MPs' work involves being informed and available at virtually any hour, we consider access to media and the internet when residing away from home is a legitimate business expense." The consultation on the proposals - including the pay rise - ended on Sunday. Ipsa says it will announce its final decision on both pay and conditions before Christmas. </body>

      <title>Green energy levy costs rise by Â£37m</title>

      <body>The annual cost of a green levy on energy companies is expected to be almost Â£37m higher than originally thought, officials have said. According to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Energy Company Obligation is now expected to cost more than Â£1.3bn by the end of the year. Administrative costs have also reached Â£35m. The scheme provides heating measures and better insulation and for low-income households. Customers are expected to pay an average of Â£50 each year to fund the Energy Company Obligation (Eco). A document published by the department shows some suppliers are discharging their obligation much more cost-effectively than others. One element of Eco aimed at reducing carbon emissions in deprived areas and rural households costs the most expensive supplier Â£136.41 to deliver per customer. The lowest reported cost was Â£38.20. The document says the figures are "only indicative" of the amount energy suppliers are likely to pass to customers. The central estimate in the government's impact assessment for the policy was Â£1.3bn. The new figure is Â£36.7m higher. So the department argues that costs remain "in line" with that estimate as the rise is relatively small compared with the original total. The figures are "unverified" costs reported by energy suppliers. The group that represents the energy industry, Energy UK, warned that costs could rise higher. It said: "We also know it is still relatively early days and costs could go up significantly over the lifetime of the scheme as the mix of measures installed in consumers' homes changes. "It's important that consumers understand the make-up of their electricity bill, and how the Â£50 being added to their bill is spent, in order that as many households as possible benefit. It serves no-one, least of all the consumer, to hide the costs involved." Energy industry figures have criticised the Eco scheme as complicated and expensive to administer. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Labour ducked the issue and left a growing problem for the consumer." </body>

      <title>Npower to raise prices by 10.4%</title>
      <description>Energy firm Npower is the latest supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4% from 1 December.</description>

      <body>Energy firm Npower has become the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill to go up 10.4%. The price rise will take effect on 1 December, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far. SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas said prices would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. The Npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3% and a gas price rise of 11.1%. The move will affect 3.1 million customers. The change will add an extra Â£137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to Â£1,459. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. "I know that any increases to household bills are always unwelcome, and this is not a decision that we have taken lightly. We will continue to take steps where we can to reduce the impact of the external influences on energy bills," said Paul Massara, chief executive of Npower. Npower echoed the view of the other suppliers by saying that the rise was the result of cost increases in delivering energy to homes, fulfilling government schemes and raw materials. The company said that it "aimed" to make a profit of five pence in the pound, which it regarded as a "fair return" for delivering energy reliably to people's homes and for the risks it has to take on. Clare Francis, of price comparison website Moneysupermarket, said she expected the other major suppliers to follow suit with price rises. "The domino effect has really kicked in," she said. But Npower said that all suppliers faced the same pressures on costs, so there was a "natural tendency" for prices to move at the same time. "When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p no-one is surprised if Sainsbury's do the same because they are subject to the same costs. We are clear that the market is competitive," the company said. It also challenged the view that prices shot up when wholesale costs went up but fell slowly after wholesale costs dropped. Yet, Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of Ovo Energy, said that he had not seen any rises in wholesale prices recently. The company, one of the smallest energy suppliers in the UK, put up prices earlier in the year. The energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Massara, of Npower, said that the Labour proposal was "superficially attractive", but it would not lead to lower sustainable prices. "It doesn't cut the growing costs of supplying energy. Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices," he said. The latest price rise comes on the day the government has given the go-ahead for the UK's first new nuclear station in a generation. There are fears from one consumer group that energy bills could go up, as the owners of the nuclear plant are being guaranteed a price for electricity. "Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. France's EDF Energy will lead a consortium, which includes Chinese investors, to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Ministers say the deal will help take the UK towards low-carbon power and lower generating costs in the future. Consumer groups, including watchdog Consumer Futures, are calling for reviews to look at the structure of the energy market, and to consider the costs and benefits of government policy. </body>

      <body>The environment minister has confirmed that he will not move his Planning Bill because of legal concerns. Mark H Durkan said amendments to the bill backed by the DUP and Sinn Fein could run counter to the European Convention on Human Rights. He also told the assembly that he had planning and economic concerns. In June the assembly passed amendments giving the first and deputy first ministers potential power to set up special economic planning zones. Other changes limited the grounds on which objectors could secure judicial reviews to challenge planning decisions in court. However, the proposals were opposed by the former environment minister, Alex Attwood, who saw them as a power grab. Mr Durkan told MLAs the ability of people to challenge decisions in court is a fundamental right of citizens. He said that legal advice was that the bill was unlawful and would be a breach of human rights. Mr Durkan rejected a DUP claim that by failing to consult the executive on his decision he has broken the ministerial code. </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An on-going dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". The owners of the Grangemouth complex are to meet later to decide on the plant's fate. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite union said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Senior figures at Ineos, which operates and owns most of the 2.6 sq-mile site, are to consider the workforce's response to the offer. In doing so, they will also look at the patterns of the result across the plant, and across its varied technical skills. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." The plan includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined contribution scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support the plan at this stage would receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <title>Welsh firms lose out on policy bids</title>
      <description>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged.</description>

      <body>Companies in Wales are being prevented from bidding for some Welsh government research contracts, including the demands of business for Welsh language skills, it has emerged. While most tenders for work are put out to everyone, ministers in Cardiff have adopted a UK government process to evaluate certain schemes. Only one company from Wales is registered to bid. The Welsh government said the process provided value for money. Only one company from Wales is registered with the department responsible in London, which means the others have been unable to bid for more than Â£800,000 worth of contracts, including a review of the Welsh government's flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme. Another research project involved assessing a Welsh government initiative to increase the amount of goods and services public bodies bought from Welsh companies. The Welsh government says between 80% and 90% of its tenders are open to all. A spokesperson said: "We are committed to encouraging Welsh businesses and higher education institutions to benefit from public sector contracts. We purchase the majority of our research via open tender or via our own procurement framework which does include a number of Welsh businesses. "We occasionally make use of the procurement framework operated by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) which provides good value for money." It said several Welsh organisations had been brought in as sub-contractors. Organisations such as the consultancies, Iaith and Oldbell 3, and the Cardiff Business School have been involved in some projects. The information emerged following freedom of information requests by Plaid Cymru. The party accuses the Welsh government of failing to "practise what it preaches" by allowing some businesses to be "cut out" of some contracts. North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd dismissed the claim that much of the work was sub-contracted back to Wales. "They take their top slice, they pocket that and they sub-contract Welsh companies to actually deliver large parts of the work , but at a fraction of the cost," he said. "So the key issue here is that the Welsh economy is in effect a leaking bucket. "There's a hole in the Welsh economy with all this potential money for Welsh businesses flowing out of Wales. We need to plug that leak." Iestyn Davies, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Cymru, said: "The government spends significant money through small businesses and large companies and it's important that the value is felt in the communities where those businesses are based. "When you spend money outside of Wales, that money's lost to Wales. "It's a very simple equation. "So good public sector procurement can leave a long-lasting value and legacy within communities. It doesn't matter how big the contract is, it can still have a real impact on a small local business." </body>

      <body>Yorkshire politician Godfrey Bloom has revealed he was ordered by UKIP's leaders to postpone the planned launch of his autobiography on the eve of the party conference a month ago as they thought it so controversial it would overshadow the event. As it turned out the 63-year-old maverick MEP did not need his book, entitled Guinea A Minute, to do exactly that. A recording from the conference emerged of him joking that a group of UKIP women who did not clean behind their fridges were "sluts". In the weeks since then he has hurriedly added a new chapter to the original manuscript attempting to explain recent events which left him defending himself against allegations of racism and sexism. The chapter, "Bongos, Boobs and Sluts", probably does just as much to reinforce the views of those that accuse him of blindly refusing to accept that his views are several decades behind the times and cause offence to many. Even his famously "anti-political correctness" party have had enough. Suspension followed his antics at the conference in September and within a few days he had no alternative but to announce that he would not stand for re-election at next year's polls and intends to spend the months until then sitting as an independent Euro MP for the Yorkshire and Humber region. At a launch party at a pub in East Yorkshire even a cursory flip through a copy of his autobiography explained that the "boobs" in his additional chapter's title was not a reference to any mistakes he might have made by his behaviour. Selections from his personal photo album included a prominent picture of him with his face between the naked breasts of a stripper. It had been taken more than 30 years ago as the then bachelor celebrated his forthcoming nuptials with a bawdy stag night at a "gentleman's club". In his book, Godfrey Bloom makes it absolutely clear he sees nothing wrong with his behaviour then or now. For leaders of a party trying desperately to shrug off an image of being run by ageing dinosaurs desperately trying to tap into mainstream electoral support it was yet another disastrous headline waiting to happen. It is no surprise that he concludes in his book: "I already knew my days with the party must be numbered." So what now for Godfrey Bloom? At the launch party he told me he had turned down approaches to appear on "Strictly Come Dancing" and "I'm a Celebrity..." But his wife did reveal that he has been known to cut quite a figure on the dance floor. "But who knows what might happen in the next six months or so," he told me as he stood, pint in hand, surrounded by UKIP party faithful who were buying multiple signed copies of his book. Godfrey Bloom's autobiography 'Guinea A Minute' is published by Grosvenor House Publishing. </body>

      <description>A new study calls for action after finding payday and doorstep lenders were "preying on the poor".</description>

      <body>Eleanor Eamens started off borrowing Â£100 from a doorstep lender to help with the cost of Christmas. Soon she ended up with six separate loans, owing the lender Â£4,000. The mum from Belford in Northumberland found the Â£50-a-week payments impossible on her income, forcing her to choose between servicing the debt and feeding her five children. But even towards the end when she was missing payments, the company continued to offer her loans. She said: "I take responsibility for what I did. Nobody forced me to borrow the money, but when you are on a small income it's so tempting. "They did not ever look if I had other debts or whether I could afford it on my income. They simply didn't have a clue." And a new study carried out in the North East has found that Eleanor Eamens' experience was all too common of low income households. Durham University worked with 24 families in Middlesbrough and Stockton. Many didn't have a bank account, and the ones that did were only allowed basic services with no access to an overdraft or credit card. The most any of the families had in savings was Â£4, yet their debts ranged from Â£340 to Â£10,000. Many had multiple loans with payday and doorstep lenders, at annual interest rates of up to 4,000% even though their incomes were small. Professor Sarah Banks, who led the study, says this had a profound and negative impact on their lives. She said: "It was quick and convenient to get the loans, but very soon people were finding themselves saddled with large debts. "Many were desperate, some had moved home, others had gone off incognito to try and get away from the debt and many had mental health problems which were quite severe." The researchers believe these families were preyed upon by lenders even though they clearly couldn't afford the debt. Professor Banks believes there needs to be a cap on the amount loaned to individuals and greater checks on their ability to pay. She said: "The companies were purely interested in getting more customers and not in whether people could pay it back. They charge huge rates and built into those rates is the assumption that they will default. "We want all these high cost credit companies to carry out affordability checks. If people can't afford them they shouldn't really be offered the loans." And the pressure does seem to be ramping up on high cost credit companies. The government is planning tighter regulation of the industry from next April, but Labour has gone a step further by backing some form of cap, and promising a levy on the firms. That money will then be used to help develop community credit unions to provide low cost alternatives. But some believe the idea is unworkable. Phil Hall from the ifs University College, which specialises in financial education, says credit unions will never be a substitute because they require people to save before they can lend He also believes the high cost credit industry is already well-supervised. He said: "The fixation with huge APR rates for payday lenders is very misleading because APRs are annual, payday loans are not. Often it is cheaper to borrow from a payday lender than to dip into an unauthorised overdraft or to take out a lengthy bank loan but these basic facts appears to be lost on policymakers. "The government should be cracking down on illegal lending and loan sharks rather than directing misguided attention to what is already a well regulated market." And those who work in the industry believe they provide a vital service. Julio Martino runs a local payday loan shop in Newcastle. He says he does check people's ability to pay and charges realistic interest rates. He said: "I think it is important businesses do not charge ridiculous interest rates but we do have to charge a rate that allows us to make money. We are not a bank, or building society or a huge financial organisation so we cannot charge APRs similar to credit cards. "We are essentially lending to people who cannot get credit from banks, and companies like mine are willing to take a slightly greater risk to lend to these people who do need credit." But the researchers at Durham University believe people can be given help to avoid unmanageable debt. They worked with community organisation Thrive Teesside to provide mentors for low income families to guide them. That helped many, and some now do use credit unions. Eleanor Eamens has also drawn a line under her loans. She'll be debt-free by January and has begun saving with her local credit union. She says she'll never go back to high cost credit. But with the high cost credit industry worth many hundreds of millions of pounds, will it ever be possible - or even desirable - to wean people off the payday and doorstep lender? </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>A musician-turned-MP says one generation has already been lost to illegal downloading and "we cannot afford to lose another one". Pete Wishart, who played keyboards with Runrig, and now represents the SNP in Parliament, compares online piracy to stealing from shops. He says intellectual property rights are "not respected, particularly in an online environment" and as such, investment in the UK's creative industries is at risk. According to the MP: "We have got to start to get it through to people that people that taking something for nothing online is the same as taking something for nothing in the High Street." Mr Wishart will be a guest on Tuesday's Daily Politics on BBC2 from 12:00 BST.

      <body>The communities secretary said he "could not be happier" after seeing shots of a cardboard cut-out of himself on tour around the USA. Students James Johnson and Daniel Falvey, from Kent, spent five weeks with a life-size version of Eric Pickles. Asked by Andrew Neil about his role as an icon for students, he said: "I always felt secretly that might happen one day, but it came a little earlier in my career than I thought". The real Mr Pickles went on holiday to Norfolk this summer, while his image was on tour with the students, who have since dined with the Brentwood and Ongar MP.

      <title>Are free schools too free?</title>
      <description>Examining the tensions over whether free schools are too free</description>

      <body>Should free schools be forced to employ only teachers whose qualifications are approved by Whitehall, to teach only in line with the national curriculum and to feed children only if the food meets national guidelines? Yes, says Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. No, says Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove. But what does his deputy, the schools minister David Laws - a Liberal Democrat - think? His is the one voice which has been missing over a weekend of controversy. I'm glad to say that he joins me on the line now*: Q: Can you clear up the confusion about whether free schools are too free to do what they like? A: There really isn't any confusion. You should pay more attention in class. Q: Well, let's see by starting with those unqualified teachers. Should free schools be barred from employing them? A: There are plenty of teachers who may not have formal qualifications but who still do a superb job. We are ensuring, through the Ofsted inspection process, that every single teacher has the capability to teach. All classes are assessed for quality, and that is the right way to ensure a backstop of high standards.** Q: Well that's clear enough. So, why did your leader - the man you're writing a manifesto for - say something quite different? A: Hold on. You didn't ask me the question as a Liberal Democrat. You asked me as a minister. Q: Are you suggesting that would make a difference? A: Well, why don't you try me? Q: OK then - speaking as a Lib Dem should free schools be barred from employing unqualified teachers? A: Yes. Our party opposes the use of unqualified teachers as Nick Clegg made perfectly clear. Q: So you're opposed to an idea that you're implementing as schools minister? A: No, I back government education policy at all times. I just think it should be different. Q: So, will you change the policy? A: We would change it after the next election, which is what Nick Clegg is saying in his big speech on education this week and what I will be saying when I write the Lib Dem manifesto. Q: So, you want voters to know that you're opposed to some of the things you're doing in government? A: That's it. You've got it. It wasn't that complicated was it? Q: One last question before you go. Wasn't Nick Clegg educated in a rather good school with lots of unqualified teachers? A: He was and I have heard him say how excellent they were but state schools are very different. Q: In what way? A: Because you have to get elected to run them and saying you're against unqualified teachers in state schools is very popular and makes you look different from those posh, ideological Tories. Minister, thank you. I think that clears things up. * This is, as I hope is obvious, an imaginary interview. ** This is a direct quote from David Laws in the House of Commons on Thursday. </body>

      <title>Europe's discontent</title>
      <description>Worries over jobs and migrants boost Eurosceptic cause</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24607866</url>
      <date>1382348321</date>

      <body>The election campaign for the European Parliament has begun. It is not that hopeful candidates are already making their pitches to the voters, but the political battleground for next May's contest is being shaped. The elections will be fought against a background of Europe's discontent. That was underlined yet again at the weekend when a poll for the Financial Times found that "hostility to EU migrants seeking work and benefits is now entrenched in the bloc's biggest economies". And on the question of whether the EU would do better with fewer powers, two-thirds of Britons agreed but, more surprisingly, so did half of Germans and nearly half of Spanish voters. A few weeks ago, a poll for Debating Europe found a majority of Europeans believe that the austerity measures pursued since the start of the crisis have failed. A few months earlier, the Pew Institute discovered that approval ratings for the EU and its institutions have fallen sharply - in almost every country except Germany. In France, only 41% had a favourable view of the EU, which was less than the UK. The political consensus behind the European project is fracturing. It is quite possible that come next May, 170 MEPs out of a total of 751 will be broadly questioning of or even hostile towards the European establishment. The main reason for Europe's discontent is the economy. Even though the acute phase of the eurozone crisis has passed, next year, three of the five largest economies in Europe, according to the IMF, will register tepid growth at best. "Europe's leaders are currently in a race against time, hoping that economic conditions will improve fast enough before an anti-reform and anti-EU backlash undermines the whole single currency project," says Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. But economic insecurity is fuelling unease over immigration and migration between EU countries. Anti-establishment parties are tapping into this wider disquiet and voters no longer necessarily believe the Commission's interpretation of figures. The political sensitivity of all this was in full display at the weekend in France, with the government and the president twisting and turning over the case of 15-year-old Leonarda Dibrani. She had been detained whilst on a school trip and later deported to Kosovo after her family had failed to win asylum. The expulsion of Leonarda had brought "les jeunes" (the youth) on to the streets in protest. French President Francois Hollande, facing pressure from all sides, came up with a formula that satisfied almost no-one. He said that Leonarda could return to school in eastern France on the condition she come back alone without her family. The president was accused of splitting families, but instant polls revealed that two-thirds of the French public do not want Leonarda to return. The government, in taking a robust stance, is aware of the growing support for the right-wing National Front. Much attention has recently been focused on the tragic journeys of migrants crossing from Africa to the Italian island of Lampedusa. My colleagues have been monitoring the speed with which arrivals now move through Europe. In Italy, where they are supposed to be processed, many are allowed to travel north without having been fingerprinted and without documents. Rules are bent or ignored in the hope that migrants will move north to places like Sweden where they will get a better welcome. The aim is to make the new arrivals disappear off the news agendas as soon as possible. Polls suggest deep disapproval of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens being able from next January to work in any member state and yet that is one of the EU's main freedoms. In a thoughtful essay on the European elections for the Centre for European Reform, Heather Grabbe and Stefan Lehne recognise that the European Parliament is still not "accepted as an essential party of the body politic". They understand the call for democratic legitimacy, but do not believe the answer lies in allowing the parliament's political groupings to essentially nominate the next head of the European Commission. They argue that not only could it lead to a partisan president, but that it will not cut much ice with the voters. They suggest the election campaign should focus on what the EU has done well, the single market, freedom to travel, etc. They would like to see the argument of the anti-establishment parties confronted head-on. "The reality is that there is no going back to autonomous national policies for the economy or migration," the authors say. They want to remind voters that "going back" would lead to higher prices and make travel more difficult. So the battleground is being prepared. The European establishment is determined to make the election about the future of Europe. They will ask voters to decide whether they want to turn back the page and to sacrifice what has been achieved. Ranged against them will be parties who will argue that austerity has led to mass poverty in southern Europe, that budgets and policies are being set by remote masters and that Brussels is insensitive to fears about migration and immigration. The months ahead will see fierce debates about the future of the European project. </body>

      <title>Defence chief admits huge challenges</title>
      <description>Britain's new top general on the future of the armed forces</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24605083</url>

      <body>The new Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Nick Houghton, says he has taken over at a time of "huge challenges". The UK's most senior military officer told the BBC the armed forces had shown great resilience in recent years. But Gen Houghton said it was too soon to judge the recruitment levels to the reserves, which are running at around half the planned levels. He is responsible for implementing cuts to the Army, while ensuring the Afghanistan withdrawal goes smoothly. UK troops are continuing to fight a campaign in Afghanistan, while preparing to withdraw - at the same time as reducing the number of regulars by 20,000 and bringing back troops based in Germany. Gen Houghton, an Oxford University history graduate and former Green Howard, is now the nation's most senior military officer and professional head of the armed forces. He is responsible for implementing the many simultaneous changes flowing from the Strategic Defence Review in 2010. The review cut 8% from the MoD's already stretched budget. In his first broadcast interview, Gen Houghton said: "If you just look at what the Army is being asked to do in terms of continuing to fight a campaign, to withdraw and downscale its numbers by 20,000 regulars, to bring 20,000 of its people back from Germany, to restructure, to build up the strength of the reserves, and during all this, take other things like public duties and Olympic security in its stride, yes, these are huge challenges." So what impact is this having on the armed forces, particularly on morale? "In terms of morale, it's not about individual happiness," he said. "It is about the ability to endure in times of real austerity, endure through times of hostility, in times of pressure. "And I think if anything has demonstrated the resilience of the morale of the British armed forces, it is the last couple of years - and the fact they still continue to perform, and are one of our nation's unique selling points." One of the tasks at the top of the agenda is the plan to continue cutting regulars in the Army to 82,000 from 102,000, while trying to increase the number of reservists from 19,000 to 30,000. Last week, MPs passed a motion that noted concerns about the government's defence reforms "in relation to whether its proposals for the reserve forces will deliver either the anticipated cost savings or defence capability". So with the current recruitment of reservists lagging well behind target, would he advise the government to think again? Gen Houghton said: "Well, I think this is more an argument in Parliament than it is one within the armed forces. "You can't compare these 82,000 regulars of the 21st Century with Victorian figures. These are 82,000 regulars, the vast percentage of which are deployable capability, not mess waiters or guards. "It's a force that's networked by modern communications. Private soldiers are connected to close air support and artillery fires. The capability of soldiers nowadays are transformed from what they were even a decade ago". "But of course, size is important, and that is why the reserves provide an essential and cost-effective mechanism of maintaining resilience." On the level of reservist recruitment so far, Gen Houghton insists it is too early to make a judgement. "We think that we have produced a good offer. We've got to get out the message that people who join now are joining something that is exciting, will give them all sorts of rewards and has a very, very strong future." However, after the Parliamentary vote on Syria that rejected UK military action, how does he see their role today? "Well, I think the message is that we've got to be quite hard-nosed about defining what the core national interest is when we want to use our armed forces, and the utility of doing so." That does not rule out military action abroad, but it may well be of a rather different sort from Iraq and Afghanistan. "We want to influence, to use our unique access in all sorts of countries to build capacity, to stabilise, and prevent conflict," Gen Houghton explains, "as well as being the 'go-to' organisation for domestic crisis, whether it's fire strikes, foot and mouth, or Olympic security." First, though, British combat forces must perform an orderly exit from Afghanistan by the end of next year after 12 years and 445 British lives lost. What is his verdict? "You've got to really take a strategic look," Gen Houghton said. "The United Kingdom has been part of an international effort to maintain the integrity of Afghanistan, to give that country the chance of looking after its own security, having a democratic process that elects the next president, that has the prospect of some prosperity and has not been the source of international terrorism. So I would deem that success." </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>
      <date>1382025093</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70547000/jpg/_70547057_70546905.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. The government believes it needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <title>Syria talks 'must bolster moderates'</title>
      <description>The UK foreign secretary urges Arab and Western nations to encourage unity among Syria's moderate opposition and keep out extremists, at talks in London.</description>

      <body>Bolstering Syria's moderate opposition is crucial to excluding extremists from power in the war-gripped country, the UK's foreign secretary has said. William Hague was speaking as Arab and Western foreign ministers gathered for talks with Syrian opposition officials. The London talks are trying to lay the groundwork for planned peace negotiations in Geneva next month. But a key group in Syria's main opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the meeting dubbed Geneva II. The Syrian National Council (SNC) has been unwilling to talk to representatives of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ministers will say unity is vital among the fractured groups of Syria's armed and political opposition if peace talks are to have any chance of success. In London, foreign ministers from 11 countries - the so-called Friends of Syria group - are trying to encourage opposition groups "to have a united position" ahead of Geneva II, Mr Hague told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Hague admitted that an increasingly prominent role was being played in Syria by Islamist rebels linked to al-Qaeda, who are engaged in no kind of peace process and who have been involved in bitter struggles with more moderate forces. "The reason we have to make sure we are supporting and dealing with the moderate opposition committed to a democratic, pluralistic, non-sectarian future for Syria is precisely because if they don't have a role, then all the Syrian people have got left is a choice between Assad and extremists," Mr Hague said. "The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes. That's why we're making a renewed effort" with Geneva II, Mr Hague said. At Tuesday's talks, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to reaffirm their view that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the Assad regime. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague said he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role" - but that required Iran to back a "transitional government in Syria made up of regime and opposition, by mutual consent". Earlier, the US Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that Syria's opposition would never agree to President Assad staying in power. "He has bombed and gassed people in his country. How can that man claim to rule under any legitimacy in the future?" he said, dismissing suggestions that Mr Assad could stand for re-election in 2014. But President Assad reportedly told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen in comments reported by AFP news agency. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. On Monday, the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, said it was postponing until early November meetings to decide whether to attend the Geneva II conference. The opposition has been further weakened by fighting between the moderate Free Syrian Army and Islamist rebel groups. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort in Syria, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. The National Coalition has insisted that President Assad play no role in a transitional authority - something the Syrian government has rejected. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. </body>

      <title>Spain orders Eta convict's release</title>
      <description>Spain's high court sets a convicted Basque militant free, after a European court ruled prison work should have contributed to her early release.</description>

      <body>Spanish judges have ordered the release of a convicted Basque militant, after the European Court of Human Rights ruled against her continued detention. Ines del Rio, of the separatist group Eta, has been serving a 30-year sentence for bomb attacks in the 1980s. The High Court backed the ruling of a Strasbourg court on Monday against Spanish laws that denied her right to earn remission through prison work. Spain says dozens of Eta prisoners could now be eligible for release. Monday's Strasbourg ruling "gives us no choice", concluded a prosecutors' report at the High Court requesting Del Rio's immediate release, reported El Pais newspaper. The penal chamber subsequently ordered her immediate release. Del Rio is expected to be freed from a prison in A Coruna, north-western Spain, later on Tuesday. Groups representing victims of Eta's bloody four-decade campaign for independence for regions of northern Spain and south-west France denounced the Strasbourg ruling in protests on Monday, while supporters of the prisoners held marches in favour. Eta declared an end to its armed campaign in 2011. Del Rio was arrested in 1987 for her part in 23 murders and car bombings carried out by Eta. She was later sentenced to more than 3,800 years in jail, but the criminal code in force at the time reduced this to a maximum stay of 30 years. Del Rio earned sentence reductions through prison work, making her eligible for release in July 2008 - but two years earlier the High Court applied what is known as the "Parot doctrine" to extend her detention. Under this doctrine, sentence reductions are applied to the sentences for individual crimes - collectively amounting to 3,828 years - rather than the overall 30-year maximum stay. It meant Del Rio's release would be postponed until 2017. But on Monday the European Court of Human Rights, upholding a July 2012 ruling in favour of Del Rio, condemned Spain for this practice and ordered Spain to ensure her immediate release and to pay her 30,000 euros (Â£25,400; $41,000) in compensation. Although the Strasbourg court's ruling only applies to Del Rio, the Spanish government says dozens of other convicted Eta members could be eligible for release. </body>

      <title>Bolshoi dancer tried for acid attack</title>
      <description>Bolshoi Ballet soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko goes on trial for allegedly organising an acid attack on the company's artistic director.</description>

      <body>A Bolshoi Ballet soloist has gone on trial over an acid attack on the company's artistic director in January. Dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko is accused of organising of the attack on Sergei Filin, whose eyesight was badly damaged when sulphuric acid was thrown at him outside his Moscow flat. Mr Dmitrichenko denies arranging the attack. If convicted, the dancer could face 12 years in jail. The attack revealed bitter infighting and rivalries inside the Bolshoi. Also on trial are the man accused of throwing the acid, Yuri Zarutsky, and Andrei Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car. As the trial began on Tuesday, the tiny Moscow courtroom where it was taking place was packed with journalists as the defendants were led into a caged dock. After initially admitting to masterminding the attack, Mr Dmitrichenko later said he had discussed an assault on Mr Filin but not the use of acid. Following a pre-trial hearing, Mr Dmitrichenko's lawyer alleged that the defendant had been beaten by masked police - a claim that the Russian interior ministry has denied. On Monday, ahead of the trial in Moscow, lawyer Sergei Kadyrov said: "Dmitrichenko does not consider himself guilty of causing grave harm to Filin's health." "I hope the court will be able to distance itself from the public resonance of this case and deliver a well-grounded and just verdict." Mr Filin has had more than 20 operations to try to save his eyesight. Following treatment in Germany, he returned to Moscow for the inauguration of the Bolshoi's season last month, wearing dark glasses. In March, more than 300 members of the Bolshoi Ballet wrote to President Vladimir Putin, saying that the idea that Mr Dmitrichenko was behind the crime was "absurd". </body>

      <title>Australia merges bushfire blazes</title>
      <description>Fire fighters in Australia deliberately join two large fires near the Blue Mountains as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in Australia have deliberately joined up two large fires as part of efforts to control bushfires across New South Wales. The fires near the Blue Mountains had been "tactically joined" to stop them merging with a third, officials say. Teams are engaged in extensive back-burning operations across the state ahead of worsening conditions expected on Wednesday. On Tuesday morning more than 60 blazes were still alight, with 13 uncontained. The region experienced light rain but firefighters say this will not be enough to quench the fires. New South Wales declared a state of emergency on Sunday amid some of the region's worst fires in years. On Monday fire officials feared that three blazes in the Blue Mountains area near Lithgow - at State Mine, Mount Victoria and Springwood - could link up, creating a massive fire. But NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that joining two of the fires had prevented them linking up with the third. "We are seeing positive results of these very deliberate, very targeted, very decisive strategies being deployed particularly in relation to back-burning operations... particularly in light of [Wednesday's] weather conditions," he said. Back-burning is controlled burning of key areas aimed at depriving a fire of fuel and prevent it travelling in a certain direction. The fire at State Mine has been downgraded to "watch and act" - from "emergency" - after some light rain at the fire zone. However, Mr Fitzsimmons added that "there's still a way to go" and that firefighters would be braced for higher temperatures and stronger winds expected on Wednesday. "We have got now probably 24 hours before we see the worst of the weather starting to develop and build across all these fire ground areas," he said. The conditions on Wednesday would be "about as bad as it gets". NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell told the BBC: "Tomorrow Wednesday in Sydney is expected to be the critical day when weather conditions return to what they were like last Thursday when these fires first started." "Whilst we've lost more than 200 properties [and] another 100 or so damaged, many thousands have been saved by the efforts of our volunteer and other fire fighters who've done a tremendous job for almost a week." Many families have their bags packed and are watching anxiously in case they are forced to flee, the BBC's Jon Donnison in the Blue Mountains reports. In parts of Sydney that has been shrouded in a smoky haze for much of the week air quality levels are reported to have been up to 50 times worse than normal, our correspondent adds. All schools in the Blue Mountains will be closed on Wednesday. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. On Monday, an 11-year-old boy in the Port Stephens area was charged with deliberately lighting two fires on 13 October. Another boy, 15, was also arrested over the fires, reports said. Amid debate over the causes of the fires in Australia, United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres told US broadcaster CNN bushfires were "absolutely" linked to global warming, hitting out at Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to repeal the carbon tax. "We are really already paying the price of carbon," she said. "We are paying the price with wildfires, we are paying the price with droughts." Mr Abbott has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, introduced under the previous Labor government, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <title>Rights groups condemn US drone raids</title>
      <description>CIA drone attacks in Pakistan and Yemen are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes, human rights groups say.</description>

      <body>CIA drone attacks in Pakistan are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes, Amnesty International says. Amnesty said it reviewed nine recent drone strikes in North Waziristan and found a number of victims were unarmed. In a separate report looking at six US attacks in Yemen, Human Rights Watch says two of them killed civilians at random, violating international law. Drone warfare has become common in the US pursuit of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Few details are known about the covert US drone operation. Senior al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed in drone strikes in Pakistan, but civilians have also died. These attacks cause outrage in Pakistan, where many assert that the strikes cause indiscriminate deaths and injuries. Last week, a UN investigation found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. UN special rapporteur Ben Emmerson accused the US of challenging international legal norms by advocating the use of lethal force outside war zones. Establishing precise casualty figures and identifying the dead in such attacks is virtually impossible as independent media are barred from tribal areas near the Afghan border. Amnesty said it had investigated nine of 45 recently reported attacks by US drones, unmanned aircraft operated remotely in control rooms, often on other continents. The group called on the US to disclose information and the legal basis for strikes carried out in Pakistan. In the report, Will I Be Next? US Drone Strikes in Pakistan, the rights group named several victims who, it says, had been unarmed and "posed no threat to life". In October 2012, 68-year-old grandmother Mamana Bibi was killed in a double strike as she picked vegetables in the family's fields while surrounded by her grandchildren, said the report. It said US President Barack Obama's pledge earlier this year to increase transparency around drone strikes had not been fulfilled. "This secrecy has enabled the USA to act with impunity and block victims from receiving justice or compensation. As far as Amnesty is aware, no US official has ever been held to account for unlawful killings by drones in Pakistan," the report said. It called on the governments of Pakistan, Australia, Germany and the UK to investigate drone strikes or other abuses that may constitute human rights violations. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch said in its report that six US drone attacks in Yemen killed 82 people, including at least 57 civilians. It added that two of the strikes killed innocent people indiscriminately. A controversial aspect of the US policy is that drone attacks are carried out not by the military but by the Central Intelligence Agency. US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta has argued in favour of the policy, saying that the US will continue to defend itself. President Obama has insisted the strategy was "kept on a very tight leash" and that without the drones, the US would have had to resort to "more intrusive military action". </body>

      <title>Turkey EU accession talks to restart</title>
      <description>The EU agrees to restart Turkey membership talks, four months after they were postponed when EU members criticised a crackdown on protests.</description>

      <body>The European Union says it has agreed to resume membership talks with Turkey. The EU's European affairs ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, said the talks would restart on 5 November, after being stalled for three years. The EU had first agreed to relaunch negotiations in June, but postponed the talks after members criticised Turkey's crackdown on anti-government protests. Turkey first applied for full membership of what was then the European Economic Community in 1987. The ministers of the 28 EU members based their latest decision on a recommendation by the European Commission. In its 2013 progress report on Turkey published last week, the Commission had criticised as excessive the use of force by Turkish police in dealing with widespread demonstrations. But it recognised that Turkey had introduced judicial reforms. It also praised the announcement last month by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of a series of political reforms, including increased rights for Kurds. Linas Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, which currently holds the EU presidency, congratulated Turkey on the resumption of the negotiating process, which he said was overdue. "Time to catch up!" he tweeted on Lithuania's official EU presidency site. Turkey has been an associate member of the European Union (then the European Economic Community) since 1963. Turkey met the last condition for accession talks in 2005, but negotiations have stalled over a range of issues, including concern over freedom of speech and democracy, treatment of religious minorities, judicial reform, and ongoing tensions with Cyprus, an EU member. During that time Ankara has watched other countries overtake Turkey in the queue for membership. Croatia became a full member of the EU in July, while Serbia achieved official candidate status earlier this year. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian militant has been shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank, the Israeli army has said. Mohammad Assi, a member of Islamic Jihad, was killed during a gunfight near the village of Bilin, army spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said. Assi reportedly exchanged fire for several hours with the soldiers from a cave after escaping an arrest raid. He was suspected of planning a bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv on 21 November 2012 that injured 29 people. The attack happened at the end of an eight-day conflict between Israel and militants in the Gaza Strip. "Mohammed Assi was hiding out in various places over the last year trying to avoid detection. This morning his running came to an abrupt end," Col Lerner wrote on Twitter. Israel Radio reported that two associates were arrested in the initial Israeli operation in Bilin in the early hours of Tuesday morning, but that Assi escaped and sought refuge in a nearby cage. The troops surrounded the cave for a number of hours, during which there were exchanges of fire. At one point, a rocket-propelled grenade was launched at the troops, according to Israel Radio. Assi was eventually shot after refusing calls to surrender, it added. Islamic Jihad said he had been one of its members, and that he was "assassinated by the occupation in Kufr Nemeh", a village near Bilin. Two months ago, three Palestinians were shot dead in clashes that erupted when Israeli troops tried to detain a suspect in the Qalandiya refugee camp. </body>

      <description>Mozambique's opposition Renamo movement attacks a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord with the government, officials say.</description>

      <body>Mozambique's opposition Renamo movement has attacked a police station in the central town of Maringue a day after annulling a 1992 peace accord with the government, officials say. Police are said to have fled their posts after gunmen opened fire and there are no reports of casualties. A Renamo spokesman said party leader Afonso Dhlakama had "lost control of the situation". On Monday, the army captured Mr Dhlakama's base, forcing him to flee. About a million people were killed in Mozambique's civil war. The conflict ended in 1992 when Renamo and the Frelimo government signed a peace accord. After the seizure of Mr Dhlakama's Sathunjira base on Monday, Renamo said it had pulled out of the peace deal. However, its 51 MPs have not withdrawn from parliament. The clashes have raised fears among many Mozambicans that the civil war could resume, threatening stability and the economic boom the southern Africa state is currently experiencing, correspondents say. State-run Radio Mozambique quoted a police source as saying that Renamo fighters attacked the police station in Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from Mr Dhlakama's former base in central Sofala province. The attack was intense, but there were no casualties, Radio Mozambique reported. A teacher in Meringue, Romao Martins, told AFP news agency that residents had fled their homes during the assault. Schools have also shut amid fears that the violence could escalate, AFP reports. "The situation is horrible here. Early this morning, armed men supposed to be Renamo, attacked and it was a mess," Mr Martins is quoted as saying. "For one hour, shooting could be heard from all directions and people fled from their homes." On Monday, defence ministry spokesman Cristovao Chume said government forces had taken control of Mr Dhlakama's base in response to an earlier attack on an army post by Renamo fighters. He confirmed that Mr Dhlakama had fled. Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga said that government soldiers had bombarded the Sathunjira base with heavy weapons before occupying it. "Peace is over in the country... The responsibility lies with the Frelimo government because they didn't want to listen to Renamo's grievances," Mr Mazanga told Reuters news agency. The government has repeatedly accused Renamo of trying to drag the country back to war, an allegation it denies. In April, at least five people were killed in central Mozambique after Renamo members attacked a police post. A force of about 300 Renamo men has remained armed since the peace accord, despite efforts to integrate them into the army or police force. Mr Dhlakama has said he needs his own personal bodyguards, and the men usually stay in his war-time camp in the Gorongosa mountains in centre of the country. After the civil war ended, Mr Dhlakama moved out of the camp to live in Maputo and later in the northern Nampula province But he returned to the mountains last year, saying he needed to be close to his men who were feeling ignored. Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Frelimo has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975. Renamo, which was formed around the same time, was backed by the white minority governments in neighbouring South Africa and what is now Zimbabwe. </body>

      <body>The sultanate of Brunei has announced it will enforce a tough new Sharia law penal code. The code - to apply only to Muslims - is expected to introduce death by stoning for adulterers and the severing of limbs for theft. Brunei already adheres to a stronger form of Islamic law than neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, banning the sale and consumption of alcohol. The new code, to be enforced in six months, will strengthen that policy. Punishments could also include flogging for such crimes as consumption of alcohol or abortion, according to a copy of the code seen by news agency AFP. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 67, who is one of the world's wealthiest men, introduced the code, calling it "a part of the great history of our nation". The sultan had already made religious education compulsory for Muslim children and ordered businesses to close during Friday prayers. But until now, Brunei's Sharia courts were limited to family matters like marriage and inheritance. Its civil courts are based on British law, a leftover from the sultanate's days as a British protectorate. Brunei's citizens have one of the highest standards of living in Asia, thanks to revenues from oil and gas, and enjoy free medical care and education. The sultan pledged the new code would not change his country's policies and officials have said in the past judges would be given discretion in sentencing. The code is to be applied only to Muslims, who make up about two-thirds of a population of 420,000. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, told AFP the situation shows "respect for basic civil and political rights is near zero in Brunei". </body>

      <title>Australia capital backs gay marriage</title>
      <description>The Australian Capital Territory has become the first part of Australia to legalise same-sex marriage, but a high court challenge is expected.</description>

      <body>The Australian Capital Territory has become the first part of Australia to legalise same-sex marriage. The ACT parliament passed a bill that will allow gay couples to marry, after a short debate on Tuesday. Celebrants will now be allowed to marry same-sex couples inside the ACT, regardless of which state they live in. Federal law, however, specified in 2004 that marriage was between a man and a woman, and the federal government is expected to challenge the move. The move was passed in the 17-member ACT Legislative Assembly, backed by Labor and the Greens, with the Liberals voting against. "There is no longer any excuse, if there ever was, to discriminate against same-sex couples in our community," ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher told the parliament. "They are our children, our parents, our brothers, our sisters, our leaders, our business people, our mentors and our colleagues." "More than anything, they are our equals. The Marriage Equality Act puts this fundamental principle and human right into law," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted her as saying. Ms Gallagher said that the first weddings could take place by the end of the year. Attorney-General George Brandis, however, says the local law will face a legal challenge, because it is inconsistent with the national-level Marriage Act. "It would be very distressing to individuals who may enter into a ceremony of marriage under the new ACT law, and to their families, to find that their marriages were invalid," a statement from the Attorney-General's Office said. The ACT bill was amended shortly before it passed in an attempt to strengthen it against a potential challenge. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who leads a Liberal-National coalition, opposes same-sex marriage. His sister, however, has recently disclosed that she is engaged to her female partner. Last year, a bill allowing same-sex marriage was voted down in both houses of Australia's national parliament. </body>

      <description>Venezuelan divers recover the remains of five bodies from a crashed plane believed to have been carrying Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni.</description>

      <body>Divers searching for Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni have taken samples from five bodies they found in the wreckage of a plane in the Caribbean, Venezuelan officials say. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega said it could take up to a month to identify the remains. But she said that the luggage found in the plane indicated they were those of Mr Missoni, his wife and friends. The group disappeared on 4 January on a flight from Los Roques islands. Mr Missoni, 58, his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, and their Italian friends Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi had been on holiday on Los Roques. They were flying back to Caracas when the plane flown by Venezuelan pilots Hernan Merchan and Jose Ferrer lost touch with the control tower some 10 nautical miles off Los Roques. The last radar report showed the aircraft accelerating at a height of 1,650m (5,400ft) before it rapidly lost altitude and speed, veering to the right until it disappeared from the radar. Following the plane's disappearance, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. The plane's wreckage was spotted in June at a depth of 75m (250ft), but Venezuelan navy divers were only able to reach it over the past 10 days. The divers said they also located a sixth body, but were not able to extract any samples from it because it was too difficult to access. Ms Ortega said that the DNA tests "could take 48 hours, but also up to a month, depending on the quality of the samples". Mr Missoni was the son of the fashion brand's founder, Ottavio Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (Â£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <body>A student at a Nevada middle school shot dead a teacher hailed as a hero for trying to convince the boy to drop his gun, authorities have said. Michael Landsberry, a 45-year-old Afghanistan veteran, was "defending the students", a local official said. The student wounded two other students before turning the gun on himself, police said. Sparks Middle School and a nearby primary school was evacuated and classes cancelled. The incident occurred at 07:15 local time (14:15 GMT) shortly before the scheduled start of classes. As many as 200 police officers responded to the scene but fired no shots, authorities said. Student Michelle Hernandez told the Reno Gazette-Journal she had seen the suspect before the shooting began. "I heard him saying, 'Why you people making fun of me? Why you laughing at me?'" she told the paper. Maths teacher Mr Landsberry, who had served two tours in Afghanistan with the Nevada National Guard, leaves behind a wife and two stepdaughters. "In my estimation, he is a hero," said Reno Deputy Police Chief Tom Robinson. "We do know he was trying to intervene." Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said Mr Landsberry "proudly served his country and was proudly defending the students at his school". The two 12-year-old wounded students were said to be in a stable condition in hospital. At a news conference, police said one student was out of surgery and the other was doing well. At an evacuation pick-up point, parents were reunited with children, some of whom were in tears, the Associated Press reported. "We came flying down here to get our kids," said Mike Fiorica, whose nephew attends the school. "It's really chaotic. You can imagine how parents are feeling. You don't know if your kid's okay." The local education authority held a session earlier this year on safety measures in its schools after 26 people, including 20 children, were killed at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. The attack briefly revived calls for gun control. But in a country where fatal shootings are an everyday occurrence, even that massacre did not lead to nationwide reforms. Elsewhere in Nevada on Monday, a man opened fire in a Las Vegas nightclub after being denied a refund for an entry fee, killing a patron who tried to intervene, police said. According to media reports, the suspect demanded his money back after he found Drai's After Hours, a club at Bally's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, too small. The club's manager and a security guard were also shot and taken to hospital, police Sgt John Sheahan said. The suspect was transported to hospital with unspecified injuries. Authorities believe he acted alone and expect to charge him with murder and attempted murder. </body>

      <title>Lone bid wins Brazil oilfield rights</title>
      <description>Rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield are auctioned to the sole bidder - a Brazilian-led consortium - amid angry clashes in Rio.</description>

      <body>The rights to explore Brazil's biggest oilfield have been won at an auction by a consortium led by Brazil's state-run Petrobras, backed by Total, Shell and Chinese firms. The group made the only bid in the auction, offering the minimum share of the surplus production. The Rio de Janeiro beachfront hotel, where the auction took place, was guarded by 1,100 security personnel. Earlier, striking oil workers opposed to the contest clashed with police. Eleven companies had expressed interest in the Libra oilfield, but the Spanish Repsol pulled out on Monday, leaving the five winners as the only ones to present a bid. Chinese state companies CNPC and CNOOC offered 10% each, while the French oil giant Total and the Anglo-Dutch Shell held another 20% stake each. Despite the lack of other offers, Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told reporters he was "not one bit frustrated" by the contest having been won by the lowest possible bid. The president of the government's National Petroleum Agency, Magda Chambriard, called the auction an "absolute success". "It is hard to imagine a more successful outcome. These companies are among the world's 10 most valuable in the energy branch," she said. Petrobras offered a 10% stake on top of the 30% it was already entitled to according to the auctioning rules. The consortium secured the rights to explore the Libra's estimated 8-12 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves for 35 years. Heavy security has been in place around the hotel in the western Rio district Barra da Tijuca since Sunday. But violence broke out on Monday morning, as protesters tried to invade the cordoned area close to the hotel. Security officers fired rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper bombs at protesters who threw stones and used corrugated iron sheets as shields. The clashes were watched by a crowd spending the public holiday on Barra da Tijuca beach. "There were bizarre scenes. Riot police firing tear gas and stun grenades, not just against protesters, but also on to the beach, with hundreds of tourists and sun worshippers looking on incredulously," the BBC's Wyre Davies reports from Rio de Janeiro. Several protesters were injured. President Dilma Rousseff had ordered tight security after violent demonstrations in Rio last week. Among the protesters are members of various unions representing oil workers, who have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries. The unions accuse the government of "selling off" Brazil's riches. Others argued that the rules set by the government for the auction allowed too much state intervention, scaring off big players such as BP and Exxon. The Libra field belongs to the Brazilian government's National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010. The offshore oilfield is located at a depth of some 5,000m (16,500ft), below a thick layer of rock, sand and salt, which makes its exploration extremely challenging. The discovery potentially doubles Brazil's known oil reserves. </body>

      <title>Venezuela downs two 'hostile' planes</title>

      <body>Venezuela says two light aircraft have been shot down after entering the country's airspace over the weekend. These were the first mid-air attacks by fighter jets since a bill authorising such action against illegal planes was approved earlier this month, the Bolivarian Armed Forces said. The aircraft were allegedly smuggling drugs from Central America and refused to follow the military pilots' orders. Another 11 unauthorised planes have been disabled on the ground this year. Venezuelan security forces say more than 35 tonnes of drugs have been found this year. The head of Venezuela's Strategic Operational Centre, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, told the country's state television that a plane had been targeted after "all other means of persuasion had been exhausted" in the early hours of Saturday. "This was the first plane shot mid-air in the country since the approval of the Law and Control Regulation for the Integral Defence of the National Airspace, following the orders of our commander-in-chief, President Nicolas Maduro," Gen Padrino said. Another plane allegedly tried to evade the authorities by trying to land on an illegal airstrip in the jungle and was also shot down. "These are drug trafficking mafias which intend to use our country as a platform for drug distribution, trespassing our airspace," the head of the National Anti-Drugs Agency, Alejandro Keleris Bucarito said, after posting a photo of the destroyed plane on Twitter. The two incidents suggest the Venezuelan government is stepping up its efforts to prevent drug-trafficking flights over its airspace, particularly since President Maduro issued a public warning to drug smugglers, the BBC's Will Grant says. After the approval of the airspace bill, earlier in October, Mr Maduro threatened "international narco-traffickers". "Any plane entering Venezuela is going to be obliged to land in peace. If not, it will be brought down by our Sukhoi jets, our F-16s and by all of the Venezuelan military aviation," he said. During the late President Hugo Chavez's period in power, the US Drug Enforcement Administration was expelled from the country provoking criticism from Washington that the Venezuelan authorities weren't doing enough to tackle drug cartels operating in the country. </body>

      <title>Kenya CCTV 'shows soldiers looting'</title>
      <description>Security camera footage emerges which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's Westgate mall siege, in which some 67 people died.</description>

      <body>Security camera footage has emerged which appears to show Kenyan security forces looting goods during last month's siege of the Westgate mall. In the footage, some Kenyan soldiers can be seen carrying white shopping bags, while others appear to take white boxes from a mobile phone store. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. The Kenyan military says it is investigating the looting allegations. News agencies say the CCTV footage is taken inside the entrance to the Westgate mall's Nakumatt supermarket, which sells everything from food to televisions. In one section of footage, several soldiers are seen walking out of the supermarket, past a blood-spattered floor, carrying plastic carrier bags. In another clip, Kenyan soldiers can be seen next to a mobile phone outlet. One reaches over the counter, and apparently removes a white item. Then more soldiers remove white items, which the Reuters news agency describes as mobile phone boxes. The Westgate attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. The Kenyan military says it has launched an investigation into the looting allegations, which correspondents say will have angered many Kenyans. At the weekend, Kenya's biggest-selling newspaper, The Nation, ran an article entitled "Shame of soldiers looting Westgate". The footage of the alleged looting emerged as the Kenyan authorities announced they had recovered the body of what they consider to be a fourth attacker. "Today, Sunday 20 October 2013, we recovered a fourth body, which we know from CCTV footage to be that of a terrorist," said the Kenyan interior minister, Joseph Ole Lenku. "DNA and other investigations will confirm their identities. We have also recovered four AK47 assault rifles which we know were used by the terrorists in the assault. We also recovered 11 magazines of AK47 assault rifles." Officials had initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants. It is still not clear whether some of the attackers might have escaped. The Somali militant group al-Shabab said its members staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. Last week, the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed that one of the suspected attackers was believed to be a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. His family fled to Norway in the 1990s, but he returned to Somalia in 2009 and allegedly joined the Somali militant group. Sources in al-Shabab have told the BBC Somali Service that Dhuhulow attended a training camp in El Bur in central Somalia, one of the militants' main bases. The sources said Dhuhulow took part in many al-Shabab operations in Mogadishu and Kismayo and was well-known in jihadist circles. </body>

      <body>The burial of Bruno Metsu took place in Senegal on Monday, with President Macky Sall among a host of people who paid tribute to the Frenchman. Former Senegal national team coach Metsu died from cancer aged just 59 and was laid to rest in Dakar. Sall described the Frenchman Metsu, who led Senegal to the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals, as "an example of humanity and virtue". He also called him a "hero among Senegalese heroes". "In this time of grief and sorrow for our country, I would like to express the ineffable compassion of the Senegalese nation," Sall said. Leeds United forward El Hadji Diouf and former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Khalilou Fadiga were among a number of past and present footballers at the ceremony at a hospital in the capital. Wellwishers waved posters of the coach and wore T-shirts bearing the message "Thank you Metsu" outside the funeral, attended by his widow Viviane Dieye Metsu (pictured )and his children, as well as leading Senegalese politicians. "Today, a true Lion went to sleep," the president said, in a reference to Senegal's nickname, the Lions of Teranga. Metsu's coffin was draped in the Senegalese flag and the green flag of Islam, a religion to which the coach converted several years ago, taking the name Abdou Karim Metsu. </body>

      <body>China's CCTV News has deleted an "incorrect" tweet on its account that said a former security chief is being investigated for corruption. CCTV claimed its Twitter account had been hacked after the post reported that President Xi Jinping had set up a unit to investigate Zhou Yongkang. The episode will embarrass the state broadcaster and fuels rumours that have swirled for months about Mr Zhou. China blocks Twitter - some state media use it to reach foreign audiences. "President Xi Jinping has set up a special unit to investigate corruption allegations against the retired leader Zhou Yongkang," read the swiftly deleted tweet, according to a screen grab on freeweibo.com, which is run by an anti-censorship site, greatfire.org. The tweet, which appeared on Monday evening, seemed to refer to an article in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper. Within a couple of hours the tweet had been removed. "The CCTV News Twitter account was targeted on 21 October and used illegally to post incorrect information copied from other sources," CCTV said through its English-language Twitter account. "The unauthorised information was deleted." Reuters news agency quoted CCTV spokeswoman Zhang Xiaojian as confirming that one of the broadcaster's Twitter accounts had been hacked, but did not elaborate. The CCTV Twitter account has more than 2,500 followers. In contrast, it has 9.9 million followers on its main account on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Mr Zhou retired from the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee during a sweeping leadership reshuffle last November. The reports that he is under investigation for alleged corruption have not been officially confirmed. President Xi has identified corruption as a threat to the survival of the ruling Communist Party, and has promised to crack down on both high-flying "tigers" and lowly "flies". </body>

      <body>The controversial Kudankulam nuclear plant in India's Tamil Nadu state has begun producing electricity after years of delays and protests, officials say. The plant was connected to the grid on Tuesday, Press Trust of India reported. In May, India's Supreme Court ruled that the power station could start operations as it was "safe and secure". Opponents of the plant, which is on the coastline hit by the 2004 Asian tsunami, fear a disaster similar to the one at Fukushima in Japan in 2011. Last year, Kudankalum was the scene of mass protests over safety concerns. But the government says the joint Indo-Russian project, which is seen as critical to India's energy needs, is "necessary for the welfare and economic growth of India" and is "completely safe". The plant is one of many that India hopes to build as part of its aim of generating 63,000 MW of nuclear power by 2032 - an almost 14-fold increase on current levels. The plant became operational during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's two-day visit to Moscow. Mr Singh was expected to finalise a deal with Russia for more reactors for the plant, but it fell through as Russia has refused to sign India's nuclear liability law. The law stipulates that nuclear firms aiming to set up plants in India will have to pay huge sums of money in case of an accident and Delhi and Moscow have not been able to agree on this clause. </body>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive. It is believed it will make an application to the courts for a temporary care order. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <title>Russia bus blast: Islamist suspected</title>
      <description>A suspected female suicide bomber blows up a bus in Volgograd, southern Russia, killing at least six and injuring more than 30, officials say.</description>

      <body>A suspected female suicide bomber has set off explosives on a bus in the southern Russian city of Volgograd, killing at least six people. Officials believe the woman was from Dagestan in the North Caucasus and was the partner of an Islamist militant. The blast, which happened just after 14:00 (10:00 GMT), also injured more than 30 people, some of them seriously. An Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region has led to many attacks there in recent years. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says the bombing has raised fears that militant groups may be planning to step up attacks in Russia in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi next February. It is believed there were about 40 people on board the bus. Our correspondent says that all buses in Volgograd have been ordered back to their depots to be searched for any sign of explosives. One man whose daughter survived the explosion told Moscow Echo radio: "It was a powerful explosion - a huge blast. There were lots of students on the bus." Another man, who was driving behind the bus, told Rossiya-24 television: "There was a blast - a bang - all the glass flew out of the windows. The cloud of smoke quickly dissipated and then I saw people start to fall out and run out to escape the bus. It was a horrible sight." Earlier reports had suggested the blast might have been caused by an exploding gas canister. Volgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow and 650km north of the North Caucasus. Vladimir Markin, of the Investigative Committee - Russia's equivalent of the FBI - told the RIA Novosti news agency: "A criminal case has been opened under articles outlining terrorism, murder and the illegal use of firearms." Mr Markin was later quoted by the Interfax agency as identifying the suspected suicide bomber as a woman from Dagestan. He said: "According to preliminary information, the self-explosion was carried out by a 30-year-old Dagestani native, Naida Akhiyalova. "According to investigators' information, the woman entered the bus at one of the bus stops and, almost right after that, the bomb went off. That is also confirmed by one of the passengers who survived." In recent years, Russia has seen a number of attacks by women suicide bombers known as black widows, who are often related to Islamist militants and carry out attacks to avenge their deaths. Female suicide bombers struck at two underground railway stations in Moscow in 2010, killing more than 35 people. They were also believed responsible for explosions on two passenger jets at a Moscow airport in 2004 that killed about 90 people. Separatists in Chechnya have fought two wars with Russian forces over the past two decades. But the violence has spread across the North Caucasus in recent years, including to mainly-Muslim Ingushetia and Dagestan. Hundreds of people, including members of the government and security services, have been killed. President Vladimir Putin has stepped up security in the North Caucasus ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which open in Sochi on 7 February. </body>

      <body>A court in Qatar has upheld a 15-year prison sentence given to a poet found guilty of inciting people to overthrow the government and insulting the emir. Mohammed al-Ajami's lawyer, Najib al-Nuami, said the Court of Cassation's ruling had been "political". His only remaining option was to appeal to the Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for clemency, Mr Nuami added. Mr Ajami was originally jailed for life last year but the sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal in February. Human rights group have criticised his conviction as a betrayal of free speech. They said his original trial was marred by irregularities, with court sessions held in secret. The case against Mr Ajami was said to have been based on a poem he wrote in 2010 which criticised the former emir, Sheikh Hamad Al Thani. But activists believe the authorities were punishing him for a 2011 poem he wrote about authoritarian rule in the region. In the poem Tunisian Jasmine, a private recitation of which was uploaded to the internet in January 2011, Mr Ajami expressed his support for the uprising in the North African state, saying: "We are all Tunisia in the face of the repressive elite." He also denounced "all Arab governments" as "indiscriminate thieves". The father of four, also known as Mohammed Ibn al-Dheeb, has said the poems were not meant to be offensive or seditious. Mr Nuami, a former justice minister, argued at the Court of Cassation that the maximum sentence Mr Ajami should have received was five years. He described Monday's ruling as "a political and not a judicial decision". "I hope the emir will grant him an amnesty," he told the AFP news agency. </body>

      <title>Egypt PM denounces church attack</title>
      <description>Egypt's prime minister condemns an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl.</description>

      <body>Egypt's prime minister has condemned an attack outside a Coptic church in Cairo on Sunday that killed four people, including an eight-year-old girl. Hazem Beblawi said the security forces were searching for those responsible for the "callous and criminal act". He also vowed that it would "not succeed in sowing divisions" between the Christian and Muslim communities. Coptic activists have accused Mr Beblawi's interim government of failing to protect churches from attack. Their community has been targeted by some Islamists who accuse it of backing the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in July. In the latest attack, two masked gunmen riding on motorbikes fired indiscriminately at people emerging from a wedding service at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the capital's Waraa district on Sunday evening. Health ministry and ambulance service officials said four people were killed, including the girl and a woman, and 17 others were wounded. On Monday, mourners gathered at the church, whose walls were marked by bullets. Security personnel were also deployed on the street outside. Father Dawoud, a priest at the Church of the Virgin Mary told the AFP news agency: "What is happening is that all of Egypt is being targeted, not just the Christians. "Enough! People are getting sick and tired of this." In a cabinet statement, Mr Beblawi said police were investigating the attack, which he called a "callous and criminal act". "Such terrible acts will not succeed in dividing Muslims and Christians." The grand imam of al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's highest religious authority, said the attack ran "contrary to both religion and morals". The National Coalition to Support Legitimacy, a Muslim Brotherhood-dominated alliance calling for the reinstatement of Mr Morsi, urged police to bring the perpetrators to justice quickly and stressed the sanctity of places of all places of worship. The Association of Maspero Youth, a Coptic group formed in 2011 after more than 20 Christians were killed by soldiers outside the Maspero state television building, accused security forces of failing to protect churches. "If the Egyptian government does not care about the security and rights of Christians, then we must ask why we are paying taxes and why we are not arming ourselves if the police are not protecting us?'' it said. About 40 Coptic churches were destroyed in a wave of attacks in August after hundreds of people were killed when security forces broke up two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo. Islamist extremists have accused the Coptic Church of having conspired to oust the president. When the head of the armed forces, Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, went on television to announce that the Islamist president had been deposed in the wake of mass opposition protests demanding his resignation, Pope Tawadros II appeared alongside him. Pope Tawadros said that the general's "roadmap" had been devised by honourable people, who had Egypt's best interests at heart. He has since received death threats, while several Christians have been killed. Christian shops, homes and businesses have also been targeted. The Coptic Orthodox Church is one of Christianity's oldest, founded in Alexandria around 50 AD. Today, Christians make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May says vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea". The campaign had resulted in the return of some illegal immigrants but it was too much of a "blunt instrument," she added. Speaking in the Commons, at the second reading of the government's Immigration Bill, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid", and Labour accused the government of aping language used by the far-right National Front in the 1970s. UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted that the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it to other parts of the country. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said he was "very pleased" the idea was being axed, describing it as "deeply inappropriate". Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett told the same programme the pilot had failed and the evidence showed it had made no difference to legitimate efforts to tackle illegal immigration. A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. The chairman of the committee, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70623000/jpg/_70623410_noka.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently announced Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Android and iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. Nokia added that the inclusion of four microphones in the higher-end 1520 should appeal to consumers interested in making recordings of school concerts and other events with multiple sources of sound. In addition, a new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. Nokia has suggested Microsoft would bring its Skydrive cloud storage service and ability to link up to Xbox games consoles to the handsets following the takeover. But one market watcher questioned their future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform and end Asha out sooner rather than later." </body>

      <body>The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, has come under fire in China for reportedly charging locals higher prices than in other major markets. The official China Central Television (CCTV) claimed Starbucks earns higher margins in China due to its pricing. Starbucks is the latest foreign company to come under scrutiny from Chinese media over its pricing practices. Earlier this year, Apple and Nestle were also put under pressure to review their prices or customer service. Starbucks is rapidly expanding in China, which is set to overtake Canada as its second-biggest market next year. In the CCTV report that aired on Sunday, it said a medium-size latte in Beijing costs 27 yuan (Â£2.70;$4.43), or about one-third more than at a Starbucks in Chicago. "Starbucks has been able to enjoy high prices in China, mainly because of the blind faith of local consumers in Starbucks and other Western brands," Wang Zhendong, director of the Coffee Association of Shanghai, told CCTV. Starbucks said its prices reflect higher food and logistical costs in China. The issue became one of the most popular talking points on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, where many users seemed to rally to Starbucks' side. "Those who are saying Starbucks is expensive are probably those who don't drink much coffee," one user said. "The prices are competitive and the quality makes people feel safe." </body>

      <body>China's four major cities saw record rise in new home prices in September, stoking fears of a housing bubble. Prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw their biggest jump since the government changed its calculation method in January 2011. Property remains a popular investment choice in China and prices have now risen for nine months in a row. Analysts say Beijing has so far held back on imposing fresh curbs due to concerns over slowing economic growth. However, data released last week showed that China's growth rate picked up in the July-to-September period - the first rise in three quarters. Many believe that with the economy picking up and property prices continuing to rise, policymakers may soon implement measures to control speculation in the sector and also keep price rises in check. Data released by the by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed that new home prices rose in 69 of China's 70 major cities in September. In the capital city of Beijing, new home prices were 16% higher in September than they were a year earlier. In Shanghai, prices rose by 17% compared to a year earlier. The southern manufacturing-based cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou saw prices rise by 20%. The eastern city of Wenzhou was the only Chinese city to post a decline. Prices fell by 1.7% from last year. </body>

      <title>Blatter could be succeeded by Webb</title>
      <description>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has indicated he could be replaced "in the near future" by Concacaf leader Jeffrey Webb.</description>

      <body>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has indicated he could be replaced "in the near future" as the head of football's world governing body by Jeffrey Webb. Webb, a Fifa vice-president, is leader of the confederation for North, Central America and the Caribbean (Concacaf). The comments to a football conference in the Caribbean are another hint that Blatter does not want Uefa president Michel Platini to succeed him. Blatter, 77, has led the Zurich-based governing body since 1998. Speaking off-the-cuff before a speech to mark the opening of a Concacaf sport summit, the Fifa boss was introduced incorrectly to an audience of regional political leaders and confederation delegates as "Fifa's vice-president" by a local media officer. Blatter stepped up to the lectern and replied to the mistake by telling the media officer and assembled guests: "I think you're a prophet." "[There may be] a new Fifa president in the near future and this president could be Jeffrey Webb." After receiving applause, he added: "This would not mean I would be vice-president. Once you have been a horse you don't go back to the stable." Sources close to Fifa have told BBC Sport that the comments should not be taken as a decision by Blatter that he will not stand as a candidate in the next election, scheduled for May 2015, and that all options are still open to him. Blatter told Uefa delegates in 2011 that this would be his final term of office but has this year given strong indications that he may seek a fresh mandate. The comments are the clearest indication so far that Platini - considered by many observers to be his most likely successor - is not the man Blatter wishes to see in power after he has left the role. Platini has yet to decide if he will stand in the 2015 election saying recently that he wanted more time to consider the matter. That leaves Jeffrey Webb - who is also yet to indicate any intention to stand in the ballot - as Blatter's anointed executive, having already been appointed by him earlier this year to lead Fifa's anti-discrimination and racism task-force. Webb, 49, is from the Cayman Isles and was elected president of Concacaf in May 2012Â  following the acrimonious departures of former president Jack Warner and general secretary Chuck Blazer. Now one of seven Fifa vice-presidents, Webb started his time in football governance as president of the Cayman Islands Football Association in 1991. </body>

      <body>Serena Williams starts a strong favourite to win a second successive WTA Championships as the end-of-season finale begins in Istanbul on Tuesday. The world number one has only lost four matches and won 10 titles this season, more than any other year of her career. She will face Petra Kvitova, Agnieszka Radwanska and Angelique Kerber in the group stages in Turkey. "It's a tough group," Williams said. "That's the thing about this event, you have to be ready from the first match." Eight of the top nine in the world rankings - world number three Maria Sharapova is injured - are split into two groups of four, with the top two in each qualifying for the semi-finals. Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who has beaten Williams twice this year, heads the other group, which includes China's Li Na, Sara Errani of Italy and Serb Jelena Jankovic. Three group matches will be played on each of the first four days. Tuesday's opening day sees Belarusian Azarenka start against Errani (15:00 BST) before Williams faces Germany's Kerber (17:00 BST) and Radwanska of Poland plays the Czech Republic's Kvitova (19:00 BST). Williams, 32, won the French Open and US Open this year to take her total of Grand Slam titles to 17, one short of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert and five behind Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22. "I never thought I would have one of my best years this year, and now there is an opportunity to do even better," she added. "I'm still looking to improve and...I have a lot of room for improvement. I am interested for next year to take my game to a new level, which I think I can do. "It's going to be even tough for me to get to 18 [ Grand Slams]. Obviously that's my goal, but I take it one match at a time." The American is aiming to become the first player to defend a WTA Championships crown since Justine Henin in 2007. If she achieves the feat, it would be her fourth title overall. While Kvitova, who won in 2011, is a dangerous opponent on a fast indoor surface, neither she nor Radwanska has ever beaten Williams, while Kerber can boast one victory from their three previous meetings. Jankovic is the only player to qualify this year who was not in the field 12 months ago. The Serb is back among the top eight of the season for the first time since 2010. </body>

      <title>Kasami goal beats Van Basten's - Jol</title>
      <description>Pajtim Kasami's goal for Fulham against Crystal Palace is better than Marco van Basten's famous volley, says Dutchman Martin Jol.</description>

      <body>Pajtim Kasami's stunning goal for Fulham at Crystal Palace was better than Marco van Basten's Euro 88 volley, according to Cottagers boss Martin Jol. Kasami's goal, a fine dipping effort from across his body in a 4-1 win, drew comparisons with Van Basten's legendary Netherlands effort. Dutchman Jol said: "It was better than you think. He controlled it on his chest and put it in the other corner. "Marco's was very different. You can't compare them, but this was better!" Van Basten's goal against the Soviet Union in the final of Euro 88 is widely held to be the greatest ever scored at any European Championship finals. He met Arnold Muhren's deep cross on the volley almost at the byeline and powered a dipping shot over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. Kasami considers his strike to be the best of his career. "I have never scored a better goal," said the Switzerland international. "I ran into the space and the pass was perfect. It was an unbelievable goal and I am very pleased." The strike even prompted Jack Wilshere, who scored a superb goal of his own in Arsenal's win over Norwich on Saturday, to tweet:Â  "Well there's my 'goal of the month' prize gone!!!! Take a bow!" Having climbed to 14th, within one point of eighth-placed Manchester United, Jol admitted it was a vital victory for his team. Fulham went behind to Adrian Mariappa's early header before Kasami's 19th-minute goal proved the catalyst for a stirring comeback. "It was unbelievably important to get a result," said Jol. "It was a game of importance for Palace, too, but we needed the three points. "The goal we conceded was sickening, but we showed some response and it was a fantastic Pajtim goal with his wrong foot. I haven't seen him do that before. It is one of the goals of the season." Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell, who followed up Kasami's strike with a memorable 25-yard volley of his own, believes the win has taken the pressure off Jol. "Going a goal down early was a bit of a blow but we knew, if we kept plugging away, chances would come," Sidwell told Sky Sports 1. Sidwell said Kasami's strike helped inspire the Fulham players. "We needed something special to get back into the game and it certainly was something special," said Sidwell. </body>

      <title>Singer Noel Harrison dies aged 79</title>
      <description>The singer Noel Harrison, best known for his hit The Windmills Of Your Mind, dies at his home in Devon, aged 79.</description>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24621450</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70627000/jpg/_70627499_bbc.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested Â£150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBCâ¦ was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around Â£5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost Â£2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new Â£150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <title>Drones kill rescuers in 'double tap', say activists</title>
      <description>Drones hit targets twice, killing rescuers, say activists</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24557333</url>

      <body>Drones are often lauded for their supposed precision and accuracy. Sometimes, though, the machines - and their human operators - make mistakes, as two new reports from human rights organisations show. The first round of missiles struck a tent in Zowi Sidgi, a village in North Waziristan, at dusk on 6 July 2012. A small group of miners and woodcutters had gathered there for dinner, according to Amnesty International's Mustafa Qadri. The tent burned. Friends and family members came running to help. A moment later, there was another drone strike. Many of the people who had come to assist their friends and relatives in the tent were also killed. Altogether 18 people died in the two rounds of drone strikes. One of the victims was a 14-year-old boy. The strikes in Zowi Sidgi fall into a special category of attacks, said Qadri, a lethal operation that includes two phases. For these attacks, the US relies on consecutive rounds of strikes - missiles are dropped, killing people. A moment later - when people in the area have raced to the scene to help the wounded, another round of missiles is dropped. This practice, known as a "double tap", as journalists have described, is being used more often. "They appear to be targeting those who have come in to help those who are injured," said Qadri. "And that's particularly shocking." His research appears in an Amnesty International report. In a May speech at Fort McNair in Washington, however, US President Barack Obama said the drone strikes in Pakistan and other countries are "effective" and "legal". "Before any strike is taken, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured - the highest standard we can set," he said. A Human Rights Watch study on drone strikes in Yemen has also been released. For the Human Rights Watch report, researchers looked at six strikes that took place in Yemen from 2009-13. Researchers claim that two of the attacks violated the laws of war "because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons". More than 640 people have been killed in US-directed drone strikes in Yemen over the past decade, according to New America Foundation. During this period of time, about 2,065 people were killed in strikes in Pakistan. Most of the people who have been killed in the strikes were militants, as research done byaccording to New America Foundation has shown. But sometimes the wrong individuals are targeted. Americans rely on information gathered by the CIA, the National Security Agency and other US agencies, as documents from former contractor Edward Snowden reveal, to plan some of the strikes. Individuals who are planning the strikes use the information in order to determine whether or not to carry out an assault - and who should be targeted. When contacted by the BBC, CIA officials declined to comment. In addition Americans may rely on so-called "pattern of life" analysis, which means they study a group of people over time in order to see if they are doing anything suspicious. The definition can be broad. Indeed Qadri and other activists believe the definition is so vague that innocent people are killed as a result. "If you're a military-aged male, you're considered a target," he said. For the Amnesty International report, researchers interviewed more than 60 people, including individuals who saw the strikes in Pakistan occur. Some of the interviews were done in North Waziristan. Based on this research, Qadri and others believe the drone strike in Zowi Sidgi was wrong. "Let's assume the US made a mistake in the first strike," he said. "But in the second round it should have been clear that they were killing civilians. A child was killed. "It's up to the US to tell us why they were targeted," he said. "In the absence of that, it's an unlawful killing." </body>

      <description>Why Julia is risking her life in comfort to go back to Sudan</description>

      <body>Fears are growing that violence could erupt once more in the disputed region of Abyei, claimed by both Sudan and newly independent South Sudan, as southerners plan to hold a unilateral referendum, reports Hannah McNeish from the area. With suitcases on heads and babies in arms, thousands of people are braving rivers of mud, bumpy truck rides and shelling out all their savings to get back to Abyei. Hailing from the Dinka Ngok ethnic group, they are determined to hold an unofficial referendum next week to decide whether the small heart-shaped area should be part of Sudan or join South Sudan. The move comes after both countries failed to meet a deadline to organise an internationally-backed referendum this month, threatening to poison the fragile peace between former civil war foes and once again send residents running for their lives. Julia William Deng, 23, gave up her nursing course, a 24/7 Facebook addiction and thousands of dollars to go back from Australia to Abyei, where power and water have dried up and many people displaced by violence live in flimsy, cramped huts. Sporting a tattoo representing the curse of Abyei, with a bird of peace but a flower that everyone wants to own, Ms Deng accepts that she is risking her life to return to an area rich in green pastures and oil but decimated by an ongoing, violent tug of war. "I know it's not safe for me, but at the end of the day, it's my place, it's my village where I belong," she says. Choking back the tears, Ms Deng says that she cannot escape the stories of orphans, widows and those sent mad by seeing family members killed in fighting in 2008 and 2011. "There's kids that told me stories that their mothers aren't alive, because of what happenedâ¦ Every day, the story gets worse. The more I talk to people, the more they tell me about what happened to them." Abyei's Dinka Ngok residents are culturally and ethnically allied to South Sudan and backed its rebel army during decades of civil war against Khartoum's rule. However, the Arabic-speaking Misseriya people, who have traditionally grazed their cattle in Abyei and like the Dinka Ngok see it as their ancestral homeland, want to remain in Sudan. The two sides cannot agree on who is eligible to vote in the referendum and so it has not been held. A 2005 peace deal that paved the way for a Southern vote on independence in 2011 was supposed to give Abyei a separate referendum on whether to be part of Sudan or South Sudan. But in Abyei, ballot boxes never appeared and tanks rumbled in, bomber planes buzzed overhead and militias stormed in alongside Sudanese troops. A raft of internationally brokered deals have fallen by the wayside, analysts say. Khartoum is not keen to implement an African Union (AU) proposal to hold a referendum this month to solve the impasse in the absence of a negotiated settlement. After losing the South and 75% of its oil at secession, diplomats say that for Sudan's governing National Congress Party, keeping Abyei has become a political necessity at a time when tensions are running high following a wave of recent protests. But in bombed-out Abyei, where telephone masts twist through houses like a macabre runaway rollercoaster, and the wind whistles through abandoned buildings stripped of roofs and fittings, nothing suggests a vote is being organized. AU representatives would not comment on Abyei. Deng Alor, a former South Sudan minister now championing the unofficial referendum, says Sudan has thwarted efforts to hold the vote. Regardless, he says that the people of Abyei will have their say now or never in a vote that Sudan "has rejected five times," most recently on the grounds that the Misseriya are not adequately represented. "President Bashir is determined, no matter how long it takes him, he will not accept the referendum commission to be formed. He will not accept the referendum to be held here, so it's a waste of time." Mr Alor says that if the AU does not support a vote, the Dinka Ngok will simply declare their choice of South Sudan and then lobby for international support. "If they say the referendum cannot happen this month, the people of Abyei will hold [a] community based referendum, and that would be unilateral, and organised by the people of Abyei," he says. Zacharia Diing Akol, an analyst at South Sudanese think-tank The Sudd Institute, says that history dictates that this would only produce one result: "Violence. Remember we are talking about an area that has been attacked in the recent past by Sudan twice, in 2008 and in 2011," he says. "The attack on each occasion was coming out of the fear that they were losing, that they were no longer in control and they wanted to control the place." People on the ground agree, and are warning the uninitiated like Ms Deng about what to expect. "They have told me stories: 'Can you run? Can you do this or that? Can you stay for 4-5 days without eating?' And I've told them that I don't think I can do it." Anger over the killing of Dinka Ngok paramount chief Kuol Deng Kuol in May could boil over in the coming weeks when Misseriya are due to cross with their cattle through Abyei into South Sudan. As rumours swirl about Sudan massing men in northern Abyei and South Sudan boosting plain-clothes forces in villages further south, some fear that this year's migration could spark clashes that the 5,000 UN peacekeepers in the region would fail to extinguish. Abyei also remains a thorn in relations between the two countries and fresh fighting could derail other agreements on oil exports and contested borders that last year provoked weeks of heavy border fighting and fears of a return to all-out war. While analysts say that Sudan is loath to let Abyei's vast arable land and oil fields go, South Sudan's largest ethnic group, the Dinka, cannot bear to lose what they regard as the land of their forefathers. Sudanese officials and the Misseriya have already threatened violence if a unilateral referendum is held, while the AU and UN have warned of wider conflicts if Abyei erupts. In an Abyei camp with no water, little food and only enough tents for the children, returnee Mary Ajok is content to sleep outside and wait until she can reclaim her homeland for future generations. "We are just hoping this referendum succeeds so the children can come back," she says of her eight children and the many orphans waiting further South, whose memories of Abyei are of indelible bloodshed. "We ran for our lives, and because there was war and a lot of destruction and the killing and the burning of houses was too much. The men were dead and the widows had to take the kids away for survival. "Now we are back in the hope that there will be a referendum... We don't know what will happen but we cannot leave this land. It's ours." A steady stream of people is returning to vote with their feet if nothing else. But if there is no real agreement, they may soon have to turn on their heels and flee. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>
      <description>The rise and rise of the celebrity patissier</description>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the classic vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaron (a light meringue biscuit), the tarte aux pommes (apple tart) or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaron with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macarons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-Ã -Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <description>Are people getting too snobbish about frozen food?</description>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was Â£2.50 and one was Â£1.50 you naturally assume the Â£2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at Â£20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <description>The winners and losers of Burma's opening up</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24605695</url>
      <date>1382395048</date>

      <body>The economy of Burma, officially called Myanmar, is open for business. That's the message the reformist government of President Thein Sein is sending out, and it has got an overwhelmingly positive response from investors. But behind the impressive headline figures of planned ventures and promised aid, who is actually doing well in the new Burma? There have been some high-profile announcements - Nissan and Suzuki want to manufacture cars, Ford has opened a dealership, Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But many foreign investors are waiting both for infrastructure to improve and for greater political certainty before jumping in. The indigenous Burmese business community, on the other hand, has been a hive of activity. Inevitably, the companies best placed to profit from the new opportunities are the so-called cronies - those who built up their businesses through close co-operation with the old military regime. Despite still being listed on US sanctions lists, with their resources and experience, they are winning many of the new infrastructure contracts. Smaller companies, though, are cashing in on booming demand for property, consumer goods and services. Wai Thit Lwin, a graduate from Berkeley in her 20s, juggles looking after her two young daughters, expanding a local chain of 50 convenience stores, and helping manage a company that operates hospitals, hotels, and markets brands such as Sony and LG in Burma. Everything she is involved in is growing fast. Her main concerns? The inadequacy of Burma's banking system - local companies have to pay punishing interest rates for capital - and the threat of competition from the convenience store giant 7-11. Then there was Cho Thet Nwe, who left school to help bring up her brothers, but is now the brand manager for the French cosmetics company L'Oreal. "When we started selling European products here in 1996, it was so difficult," she recalls. "Back then the whole family would use the same soap, from head to toe. We were trying to sell facial foams and shampoo - we had to start educating them from zero. But now lifestyles have changed tremendously." One of the most conspicuous improvements in consumer choice is the availability of mobile phones. When I first reported from Burma 12 years ago only a tiny elite were allowed to buy mobiles. The phones themselves were heavy, ancient, first generation models. Today Sim cards are available, although still in limited numbers and for a much higher price than in neighbouring countries. And you can buy pretty much any model of phone, from the numerous, glaringly lit shops in Rangoon (also known as Yangon). Myat Thiri Khaing studied Chinese at university, intending to work as a translator. Instead she joined one of Burma's first phone retailers, Lu Gyi Min, excited by the possibilities of technology. Today she is the manager of the busy Latha Street branch, doing evening classes in management to improve her chances of promotion. The business is growing quickly, she told me, especially outside Rangoon, where they have plans to open more branches. But amid these positive stories, the majority of Burmese have yet to feel any material benefits from the reforms. And there are some who feel they are losing out in this new and unpredictable environment. A few kilometres from downtown Rangoon is south Dagon, designated an industrial zone back in the days of military rule. Part of it is given over to rows of small iron foundries, operating the most primitive technology. Sweat-grimed workers pull glowing strips of metal from open furnaces, and toss them expertly to others who catch them with tongs, and run them through clattering presses. I met U Mitthya, who assembles small pick-up trucks, his workers welding them by hand. In the days of military rule, when car imports were tightly restricted, it was a good business. Now as inexpensive vehicle imports flood in, it is no longer a viable business. He said the three trucks in his workshop were probably the last he would make. The big plans to expand Burma's industrial base have caused casualties too. The most ambitious project is a planned industrial estate next to the port of Thilawa, south of Rangoon, to provide an area of reliable power and suitable infrastructure for Japanese manufacturers. But this requires moving the people who have been living on the land for many years. Daw Htay Htay and a few of her neighbours say that under military rule they had been forced to give up their land for paltry compensation. But as the planned project never took off, they simply carried on cultivating it. Now the government wants to start construction of Thilawa, as early as the end of this year. It has offered the value of six years' rice harvests, and an alternative plot of land. Daw Htay Htay says she is being put under pressure by officials to accept, but feels the compensation is not enough. In this time of change, she told me: "I feel it is only we who are losing." But it is not only her. Land disputes have erupted all over the country, as new economic opportunities make previously worthless land valuable again. This is an emotional issue, with the potential to overshadow much of the good news that is coming out of Burma these days. </body>

      <description>Canine distemper is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May says vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea". The campaign had resulted in the return of some illegal immigrants but it was too much of a "blunt instrument," she added. Speaking in the Commons, at the second reading of the government's Immigration Bill, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid", and Labour accused the government of aping language used by the far-right National Front in the 1970s. UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted that the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it to other parts of the country. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert said he was "very pleased" the idea was being axed, describing it as "deeply inappropriate". Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". And former Labour home secretary David Blunkett told the same programme the pilot had failed and the evidence showed it had made no difference to legitimate efforts to tackle illegal immigration. A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. The chairman of the committee, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. </body>

      <body>Former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall is to be stripped of his OBE by the Queen after he was jailed for a series of sexual assaults on young girls. Hall, 83, admitted 14 counts against girls aged from nine to 17 between 1967 and 1985 in June. His 15-month sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal. An independent forfeiture committee decides whether recipients should lose honours if they have brought the system into disrepute. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the original sentence was "unduly lenient" given the impact on Hall's victims. Lord Judge said Hall had "got away with it" for decades and had "lived a lie for more than half of his life". </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save Â£500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS Â£2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra Â£500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a Â£200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise Â£200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between Â£60m and Â£80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is Â£20m-Â£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further Â£50m-Â£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" Â£500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just Â£73m a year is recouped out of more than Â£460m at present. A Department of Health spokeswoman said the proposed new levy would apply to all non-EEA nationals - regardless of whether their country has a reciprocal arrangement with the UK. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's Â£500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed Â£200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than Â£200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <title>Facebook irresponsible says PM</title>
      <description>David Cameron brands Facebook irresponsible for allowing beheading videos to appear on its site without warnings.</description>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has waded into an escalating row about Facebook's decision to allow videos showing people being decapitated back on its pages. He tweeted that it was "irresponsible" of the social network to post such videos without warning. Facebook reversed a temporary ban on such videos, saying users should be free to watch and condemn such content. The move was also condemned by one of the website's advertisers. The row gained momentum when Mr Cameron tweeted: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Car-sharing firm Zipcar told the BBC it was disappointed that its adverts had appeared next to one of the videos. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. The BBC was alerted to the fact that such content was back online by a reader who said the firm was refusing to remove a page showing a clip of a masked man killing a woman, which is believed to have been filmed in Mexico. It was posted last week under the title, Challenge: Anybody can watch this video? The social network later confirmed it was allowing such material to be posted again. "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," said a spokeswoman. "However, since some people object to graphic video of this nature, we are working to give people additional control over the content they see. This may include warning them in advance that the image they are about to see contains graphic content." But the decision has been criticised by its own advisors and law enforcers. The chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute, Stephen Balkam - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "surprised" and "unhappy" at the move and would be contacting the firm to make clear his concerns. After being contacted by a member of the local community, the South Australia Police (Sapol) force has also registered a complaint with Facebook about a video showing the decapitation of a woman. Facebook advised Sapol it would not be removing the video. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Facebook advised us that they had reviewed the video and found, 'It did not violate our community standard on graphic violence'. Our team then spoke with a representative of Facebook about the decision, but were advised that the video would remain in place as a platform for community debate. "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." </body>

      <body>A would-be bridegroom who made a hoax bomb threat to a wedding venue after realising he had failed to confirm his booking has been jailed. Neil McArdle, 36, of Medbourne Crescent, Liverpool, realised his error the day before he was due to marry at St George's Hall in the city in April. Rather than tell fiancee Amy Williams, he made a bomb-threat call from a phone box, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He was given a 12-month jail sentence after admitting making the hoax call. McArdle could not face telling Miss Williams, the "love of his life", that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen, the court heard. So as she got dressed on the morning of the wedding he slipped out of the house, went to a phone box and, disguising his voice, told the receptionist at Liverpool Register Office, which is part of St George's Hall: "This is not a hoax call. "There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" and the building was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. Miss Williams was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party. But his would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Miss Williams's sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and McArdle was arrested the same day, admitting to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked and staged the bomb scare after bungling the wedding booking forms. He later pleaded guilty to communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Miss Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. Barrister Charles Lander, defending, said: "If it wasn't so serious the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." However, he said McArdle realised this was "no laughing matter". Judge Norman Wright said it was an "extremely serious" case, with custody the only appropriate sentence. </body>

      <body>Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He is accused of carrying out the offences between 1976 and 2008. The allegations relate to 11 female complainants, aged between 15 and 29 at the time. The 68-year-old appeared at Southwark Crown Court under his real name, David Patrick Griffin. His trial date was set for 14 January 2014. It is expected to last five to six weeks. Mr Travis, of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree officers in November last year. The Metropolitan Police investigation was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile. The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others". Mr Travis's arrest fell within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation. He is currently on bail on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims. Mr Travis denied the following counts in court on Tuesday: </body>

      <title>Scottish Power to pay Â£8.5m penalty</title>
      <description>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power is to pay customers Â£8.5m after an investigation by industry regulator Ofgem into its doorstep and telephone selling. Ofgem said customers were misled during sales approaches due to Scottish Power's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. Consumers on the "warm home discount" will receive about Â£50 each. Money will also go to those who were misled. The company has apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012. "Today's announcement is a clear signal to energy suppliers of the consequences of breaching licence obligations," said Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement Sarah Harrison. Scottish Power will pay Â£7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty. It estimates each will receive a payment of about Â£50. It has also set up a Â£1m customer compensation fund for customers who believe they have been mis-sold to. Scottish Power said the failings identified had now all been rectified. It stopped doorstep sales in 2011 and has also put in place independent checks on the conduct of its telephone agents. Ofgem said the size of the fine reflected Scottish Power's cooperation during the investigation. "Ofgem's investigation found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers," the energy regulator said in a statement. Scottish Power said it would write to the 336,000 people who could have been affected and could be in line for compensation. "We accept Ofgem's findings and we apologize unreservedly to those customers affected," said Neil Clitheroe, of Scottish Power. "This arose as a result of new regulations which were introduced in 2009. I am sorry to say that we didn't implement these properly at that time. "However, I am pleased that Ofgem has made it clear that they found no evidence of a strategy by Scottish Power to deliberately mis-sell to customers. "Since 2011 we have taken determined steps to resolve the problem: doorstep selling was stopped; and all telephone sales staff are properly trained and monitored." Scottish Power is not the only energy supplier to have been in trouble with the regulator over doorstep selling. In April, Ofgem said that SSE was guilty of management failures that led to "prolonged and extensive" mis-selling through telephone, in-store and doorstep sales. The regulator handed down a record Â£10.5m fine. Two other investigations - into Npower and E.On, are ongoing. Energy companies no longer sell energy door-to-door, a change that has reduced the number of people switching suppliers in recent times, figures show. Also on Tuesday, new rules from Ofgem came into force preventing energy firms from increasing prices during fixed-term contracts. Firms are also banned from automatically rolling customers on to another fixed-term offer when their current one ends. Ofgem says the changes are aimed at ensuring customers get the best energy deal for them. "Ofgem is going to make it easier for consumers to 'vote with their feet'", said Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright. The rules are part of a series of reforms, relating to new standards of conduct for energy firms. "Our reforms seek to give consumers the tools they need to find the best energy deal for them," added Mr Wright. The reform follows Ofgem's research showing that even on fixed-term deals, suppliers could still increase prices. </body>

      <title>Syria talks 'must bolster moderates'</title>
      <description>William Hague urges Arab and Western nations to encourage unity among Syria's moderate opposition and keep out extremists, at talks in London.</description>

      <body>Bolstering Syria's moderate opposition is crucial to excluding extremists from power in the war-gripped country, the UK's foreign secretary has said. William Hague was speaking as Arab and Western foreign ministers gathered for talks with Syrian opposition officials. The London talks are trying to lay the groundwork for planned peace negotiations in Geneva next month. But a key group in Syria's main opposition alliance is threatening to boycott the meeting dubbed Geneva II. The Syrian National Council (SNC) has been unwilling to talk to representatives of Bashar al-Assad's government. Ministers will say unity is vital among the fractured groups of Syria's armed and political opposition if peace talks are to have any chance of success. In London, foreign ministers from 11 countries - the so-called Friends of Syria group - are trying to encourage opposition groups "to have a united position" ahead of Geneva II, Mr Hague told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Hague admitted that an increasingly prominent role was being played in Syria by Islamist rebels linked to al-Qaeda, who are engaged in no kind of peace process and who have been involved in bitter struggles with more moderate forces. "The reason we have to make sure we are supporting and dealing with the moderate opposition committed to a democratic, pluralistic, non-sectarian future for Syria is precisely because if they don't have a role, then all the Syrian people have got left is a choice between Assad and extremists," Mr Hague said. "The longer this conflict goes on, the more sectarian it becomes. That's why we're making a renewed effort" with Geneva II, Mr Hague said. At Tuesday's talks, Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to reaffirm their view that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the Assad regime. Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague said he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role" - but that required Iran to back a "transitional government in Syria made up of regime and opposition, by mutual consent". Earlier, the US Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that Syria's opposition would never agree to President Assad staying in power. "He has bombed and gassed people in his country. How can that man claim to rule under any legitimacy in the future?" he said, dismissing suggestions that Mr Assad could stand for re-election in 2014. But President Assad reportedly told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen in comments reported by AFP news agency. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. On Monday, the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, said it was postponing until early November meetings to decide whether to attend the Geneva II conference. The opposition has been further weakened by fighting between the moderate Free Syrian Army and Islamist rebel groups. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort in Syria, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. The National Coalition has insisted that President Assad play no role in a transitional authority - something the Syrian government has rejected. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. </body>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has said he hopes the "extraordinary" baptism of Prince George will inspire others to seek the same ceremony. The Most Rev Justin Welby will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace on Wednesday. In a YouTube film released ahead of the service, the archbishop said he hoped people would not view baptism as only for a future king or "special people". "All babies are unbelievably special, not only royal babies," he said. The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and is third in line to the throne. His baptism, described by the Archbishop of Canterbury as "hugely important", will take place at 15:00 BST. "As a nation we're celebrating the birth of someone who in due course will be the head of state," he said. "That's extraordinary. It gives you this sense of forward looking, of the forwardness of history as well as the backwardness of history, and what a gift to have this new life and to look forward." But he said Prince George would be joining two billion people around the world in the "family of the church" when he was baptised, adding "the great good news is that God doesn't care who we are". Archbishop Welby said the royal couple would have received so much advice they could "probably fill a house with it". But he said his message to them would be "what an amazing gift, what wonderful times that you will have". Princess Beatrice was the last well known royal baby to be christened in the Chapel Royal, in December 1988. Prince George will be christened in a replica of the intricate lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The guest list for the christening has not been released but Kensington Palace has said close members of both families will attend. Following the christening, a picture will be released showing the Queen with three future monarchs - the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George. The official photographs will be taken by portrait photographer Jason Bell. Meanwhile, the Royal Mint is to create a set of commemorative coins to mark the occasion. </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested Â£150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBCâ¦ was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around Â£5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost Â£2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new Â£150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <body>Five men have been held in connection with a smash-and-grab raid in which watches worth almost Â£1.5m were stolen from London's Selfridges store. The men were arrested earlier when police raided eight addresses in Islington, north London. They are also being held over a robbery at a jewellery store in Windsor in Berkshire, in April. Two men have already been jailed for the Selfridges robbery which took place in June. Sam Curtin, 24, and Connor Groake, 19, both from Islington, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob and aggravated vehicle-taking. Curtin was sentenced to 10 years while Groake was jailed for seven years, at Kingston Crown Court in July. Det Insp Bob Currie said the arrests showed "that the Flying Squad will continue to pursue those who choose to commit these types of offences, gathering the necessary intelligence to arrest them and bring them before the courts". </body>

      <title>PCs sacked over stun gun misuse</title>
      <description>Two police officers are sacked after the police watchdog upholds a complaint by a man who was shot five times with a stun gun in Liverpool.</description>

      <body>Two police officers have been sacked after a man was wrongly arrested and shot five times with a stun gun in Liverpool. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) upheld a complaint by Kyle McArdle who was arrested for urinating in an alley in 2009. Mr McArdle, 26, was later cleared by magistrates of assaulting two PCs. Merseyside Police said it welcomed the watchdog's comments and it was now reviewing its use of Tasers. PCs Simon Jones and Joanne Kelly were dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary hearing while a third officer, a sergeant, had already been dismissed from the force for an unrelated matter. "I feel that justice has now been done and I can get on with my life," said Mr McArdle. He was arrested in December 2009 when he was spotted urinating in an alley off Elliot Street. He was put into a van and shot five times with a Taser, three times with the weapon pressed against his chest, leg and upper abdomen. The arresting officers claimed he was violent and the Taser was needed to restrain him. Taser barbs were also removed from his chest by an officer despite guidelines which say they should normally be removed by a medical professional. The officer claimed he feared Mr McArdle would remove them himself to use as weapons. Mr McArdle complained that the repeated use of a Taser in the confined space of a police van was disproportionate. The IPCC upheld his subsequent appeal and recommended Merseyside re-investigate, considering if the Taser use would be justified had the victim been lawfully arrested. Merseyside Police's leading Taser instructor found that the Taser use was "necessary, proportionate, reasonable and in line with the officers' training". The watchdog upheld a second appeal, finding that the officers should have been served with notices for gross misconduct and interviewed under caution. In the UK, Tasers are prohibited weapons under the 1968 Firearms Act. A 12-month trial of Tasers by 10 police forces in England and Wales, with specially trained units including Merseyside Police, began in September 2007. It was extended the following year to all forces in England and Wales. Those officers using Tasers are trained and when used, the officers have to justify their actions as being "necessary and proportionate under the law". IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: "While we welcome the robust action eventually taken by the force in response to our appeal findings it is a concern that Merseyside's lead Taser instructor lacked objectivity and presented as fact the officers' version of events without challenge." </body>

      <description>The singer Noel Harrison, best known for his hit The Windmills Of Your Mind, dies at his home in Devon, aged 79.</description>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <description>The Queen has visited the National Theatre on Tuesday, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday.</description>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. They were given a backstage tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner and watched rehearsals for forthcoming family show Emil and the Detectives. Their visit marked the anniversary of the first performance at the theatre Peter O'Toole opened the venue on 22 October 1963, playing Hamlet under the eye of founder Sir Laurence Olivier. More than 800 productions have taken place at the venue in the intervening 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit, the Queen and Prince Philip enjoyed a musical number from Guys and Dolls, which was the first musical staged at the National, in 1982. Starring Bob Hoskins and Julia McKenzie, the production ran for four years, breaking all box office records. The royal visitors also visited the props workshop and unveil a plaque to commemorate the theatre's 50th anniversary. Originally based at the Old Vic, the NT moved to the South Bank in 1976, where it remains. It also has a foot planted in the West End, where several of its productions - including War Horse and One Man, Two Guv'nors - have transferred. The institution's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith, will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony, "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. The event will be screened on the BBC, which has also commissioned two hour-long Arena specials on the history of the theatre. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry." "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <title>Norway note in bottle sparks appeal</title>
      <description>A Norwegian family is trying to trace a British woman who placed a message in a bottle in July 1996.</description>

      <body>A Norwegian family is trying to trace a British woman who placed a message in a bottle in 1996. The note written by the then 12-year-old Loretta Brooks from London was washed up off Rjaneset in April last year and found by a sister and brother. Mia and Martin Rodal, now aged 10 and eight, spotted it while on a walk with their parents but their own postal response did not elicit a reply. Despite turning to social media, they have been unable to locate Loretta. "Finding a letter in a bottle is a kids' dream. It is like finding a secret treasure," said Mia and Martin's father Gunnar. "The kids talked about treasure hunting by the sea, and finding a message that had drifted across the North Sea for 16 years was an exciting experience. "But we have tried all options we could think of to find Loretta." It is not known where the bottle containing the letter, dated 14 July 1996, started its journey but it could have potentially travelled more than 800 miles (1,300km) from the UK to Norway. Mia and Martin, from Oslo, spotted the plastic bottle during an Easter holiday visit to their grandparents, who live on Norway's west coast. "They were about four metres away but said they could see a message in a bottle," said Mr Rodal, a 42-year-old sales executive. "It was surrounded by slippery rocks so I took it out of the water for them." In the brief letter, Loretta described herself as a "girl from England". "I don't know who you are but anyway... What is your name? Send me a letter," she wrote. Mr Rodal said: "Mia was fascinated by the thought of a 12-year-old girl that she maybe could be friends with. It took a little bit of time to understand that she would not be 12 anymore." But Loretta did not give her full address on the letter, only including what appears to be an incomplete postcode. She wrote her address as either London E 436, or London E 43G, England, suggesting she lived in the east of the capital. Despite the lack of details, the family decided to send a response, together with a photocopy of Loretta's letter and the original bottle. "I added my own address and an explanation on the envelope but we didn't hear anything," said Mr Rodal. He said: "Of course there is every chance that Loretta had moved and maybe changed her name. But we have tried to find her using Facebook, Linkedin and other online options." More than a year later, Mr Rodal said he was inspired again to try to trace Loretta after reading a newspaper story this month about a letter dropped into the sea in Cornwall in September 1994. That letter was found by a remote beach near the town of Hauge in Norway and traced to its sender Lucy Elliot, who is now 31, and living in Northamptonshire. </body>

      <title>Girl removed from Dublin Roma family</title>
      <description>Police in the Republic of Ireland remove a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin.</description>

      <body>Police in the Republic of Ireland have removed a seven-year-old blonde girl from a Roma family in Dublin. The girl was taken into care after officers called to a house in Tallaght on Monday afternoon. They saw a number of children, including the seven-year-old girl who has blonde hair and blue eyes. The parents told police the child was their daughter, but officers were not satisfied with the explanation nor with the documents that were produced. The Sunday World newspaper reported that a birth certificate was believed to have eventually been produced but officers were not satisfied with it. The paper reported that although the couple claimed the child was born in the Coombe hospital in Dublin in 2006, the hospital had no record of the child being born on the date quoted by the parents. The child was removed from the family under powers in the Child Care Act. It is understood the child is now in the care of the Health Service Executive. It is believed it will make an application to the courts for a temporary care order. Police had been told by a member of the public that a six or seven-year-old girl was living with a large Roma family and looked nothing like any of her siblings. Last week a young blonde girl was found during a raid on a Roma camp in central Greece. A Roma couple have been formally charged with abducting the girl, named Maria, and have been placed in detention pending a trial. DNA tests showed that she was not related to the couple, who insist they were given her legitimately. Maria is being cared for by a charity in Athens, which has received more than 8,000 calls after an appeal. The case has brought a response from two families in the UK with long-missing children. Ben Needham from Sheffield disappeared aged 21 months while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. His sister said the discovery of the blonde-haired girl in central Greece gave them "great hope". A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose three-year-old daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. </body>

      <body>An attack that left a County Armagh student brain damaged lasted just three minutes, a court has heard. The trial of Heriberto Viramontes, 34, heard from a woman who said she was with him the night Natasha McShane and her friend were robbed and beaten. He is accused of attempting to murder the women in Chicago in April 2010. The prosecution witness, Marcy Cruz, said she stayed in a van smoking marijuana as the defendant went to "rob some women". Ms McShane and her friend, Stacy Jurich, were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago on 23 April 2010. Marcy Cruz has pleaded guilty to her role in the attack. She testified against Mr Viramontes on Monday as part of a plea deal, and said she expected to serve 19 years of a 22-year sentence. Cruz told Cook County Criminal Court that they had been driving in her van in the Bucktown neighbourhood when he told her to "look at these white hoes". She told the court he grabbed a wooden bat from the van, jumped out and was gone long enough for one song to play on the radio, while she stayed behind smoking marijuana. When Mr Viramontes returned, he allegedly said to Cruz that "the girls were really pretty" and that he did some "bogus" stuff. She said he had two handbags with him and told her to "drive off". The defendant grabbed the credit cards and told Cruz to take what she wanted, the court heard. She said she took some perfume. The court later heard that police first talked to Cruz two days after the attack on the two young women, after someone in her apartment block used Ms Jurich's mobile phone. Following the brief conversation with police, Mr Viramontes told her to get rid of the phone. Under cross-examination, Cruz admitted giving different stories to the police at different times. She said she did not tell the truth when first questioned by police following her 26 April arrest. Multiple tests carried out on swabs revealed no blood in the van allegedly used by Heriberto Viramontes, the court heard. There was no blood on the bat found in the van, according to a forensic biologist with the Illinois State Police crime lab. DNA samples were taken from Ms McShane, Ms Jurich, Mr Viramontes and Cruz for comparison with swabs taken from the baseball bat. They knew there was DNA from three people in the sample but could not carry out separate tests as they were all mixed in together. While DNA from the three women was not found, the results for Mr Viramontes were inconclusive. It could not be ruled out, the court was told. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, who is now 27, is unable to speak and struggles to walk or do simple tasks as a result of the injuries she sustained in the beating. She had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. Mr Viramontes is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges, from misuse of a credit card to aggravated battery. </body>

      <title>Email error revealed inmate details</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Justice is fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to the families of three prisoners.</description>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined Â£140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <body>French travellers blocking health workers from parking at a hospital say they will stay another day despite a request to leave the staff car park. NHS officials have written to the travellers asking them to move the 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The hospital has been seeking legal advice to try and move the vehicles. The travellers arrived late Saturday afternoon and moved on to the 300-space car park. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." </body>

      <title>Buyer sought for Grangemouth plant</title>
      <description>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant which is at the centre of an industrial dispute.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government is trying to find a buyer for the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals plant. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said ministers had been having discussions "with other players". An on-going dispute between owners Ineos and the union Unite has resulted in the plant being temporarily closed. Grangemouth plays an important part in bringing ashore North Sea oil and supplies petrol and diesel to the whole of Scotland and the north of England. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options and there certainly will be other players around the globe interested in this particular plant. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue to make a major contribution to the health and well-being of the Scottish economy." He added that government ownership was "not appropriate" and that there was a "buyer out there". The owners of the Grangemouth complex are to meet later to decide on the plant's fate. Responding to Mr Swinney's comments on talks about a takeover of the site, Declan Sealy, a director for Ineos at Grangemouth, said: "Like every business, we look at buying and selling assets and businesses all the time. "Our focus here today is on trying to implement a survival plan that brings a future for Grangemouth." However, it is not thought there has been any discussion with Ineos of a sale or a different operator. Unite said it would support the Scottish government in whatever way it could "to ensure a secure future for Grangemouth and its working community". The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said Mr Swinney's intervention was a "welcome" one. He added: "This site is so key to the Scottish economy, so key to the UK economy, it cannot be treated the way it is being treated. "It cannot be used in a Russian roulette type of way of 'we get what we want or we close this site down'. It is just so irresponsible and that type of behaviour cannot be tolerated. "This site cannot close, that's not an option and it does have a future, a really good, bright future." Unite union said half of the 1,350-strong workforce had rejected Ineos' proposed change to contracts. The company gave employees until 18:00 on Monday to accept plans, including a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. The union said the refusal of the workforce to accept the new contract terms was a mandate to return to talks and fire up the plant. It was shut down last week by Ineos in response to a strike threat over the disciplining of a union representative at the complex. Ineos had said the plant would close without new investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. Senior figures at Ineos, which operates and owns most of the 2.6 sq-mile site, are to consider the workforce's response to the offer. In doing so, they will also look at the patterns of the result across the plant, and across its varied technical skills. The firm said it would communicate the shareholders' views directly to the workforce on Wednesday. However, Ineos has warned a decision on the plant's fate could take several days. A spokesman added: "Ineos is now considering the numbers of employees that have given their support to its survival plan. "Consultations on the survival plan formally began last Thursday. It will take 45 days before any changes to terms and conditions can be introduced and 60 days before any changes to pensions can be implemented." The plan includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced and pensions transferred from a final salary to a defined contribution scheme. The company has said no job cuts were expected. It also said employees who support the plan at this stage would receive a transitional payment of up to Â£15,000 and an enhanced employer contribution to their pension. Majority shareholder Jim Ratcliffe has said if the petro-chemical plant goes, the neighbouring refinery is unlikely to survive. He has also said Ineos may not be willing to pay the cost of a prolonged shutdown. Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also repeated the Scottish government's calls for the firm to "fire up the plant" and urged both sides to avoid "the clear danger of a stalemate". He added: "The trade union has given, in my estimation, a very clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no industrial action this side of Christmas, and indeed last night the union said there would be no strike action well into 2014. "I think we should take these commitments at face value, accept them, and get the plant operating again." The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides most of the fuel in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year, which are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. </body>

      <body>Heavy rainfall across parts of Scotland has caused flooding and travel problems in southern and central areas. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning covering Central, Tayside, Fife, Strathclyde, the Borders, south west Scotland and the Borders. Flood alerts and warnings are in place for parts of Tayside, Ayrshire, Central and Dumfries and Galloway. A number of roads across the country have also been closed as a result of the downpours. A fallen tree and power cable blocked the B725 Dalton to Hoddom road in Dumfries and Galloway. Many roads were severely flooded, including the A737 which was closed between Kilbarchan and Howwood in Renfrewshire. Surface water has caused problems on the M74 in the Lanarkshire area and drivers have also been warned to take care on all routes in Dumfries and Galloway. Train passengers faced cancellations and delays through Anniesland and Westerton in Glasgow because of flooding. Flooding between Dalmuir and Garscadden was also disrupting trains through those stations to Motherwell, Springburn and Lanark. Corsehill Primary in North Ayrshire has been closed as a result of the bad weather. The worst of the rain was expected to have passed by early afternoon. </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental ill health. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 200 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Dewani extradition appeal 'reopened'</title>
      <description>Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani's lawyers win a further High Court hearing in his battle against extradition to South Africa.</description>

      <body>Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani's appeal against extradition to South Africa is to be reopened, judges at the High Court indicated. It is the latest move by the 33-year-old Bristol businessman to halt his removal from the UK to face trial over his wife's death. Mr Dewani is accused of plotting to kill 28-year-old Anni Dewani, who was shot in Cape Town in November 2010. He was told in July he will be extradited to South Africa for trial. The extradition was first ordered by a senior district judge in 2011. It was appealed to the High Court in 2012, where it was sent back to the district judge. In July, Mr Dewani's extradition was ordered once again. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas has now indicated that the original appeal will be reopened. A point of law was left open at the original appeal - whether Mr Dewani is deemed to be an "accused" under the Extradition Act. A second issue relates to whether it is unjust to extradite a person such as Mr Dewani, who it has been agreed is unfit to plead. Speaking outside the court, Anni Dewani's mother Nilam Hindocha said it was "nearly three years since she was killed and we have kept our dignity and respect throughout". "I was brought up to believe British justice is the best in the world, so it is very hard to understand why we are still here. "I am the mother of a murdered daughter. How long do I have to wait?" </body>

      <title>Kasami goal beats Van Basten's - Jol</title>
      <description>Pajtim Kasami's goal for Fulham against Crystal Palace is better than Marco van Basten's famous volley, says Dutchman Martin Jol.</description>

      <body>Pajtim Kasami's stunning goal for Fulham at Crystal Palace was better than Marco van Basten's Euro 88 volley, according to Cottagers boss Martin Jol. Kasami's goal, a fine dipping effort from across his body in a 4-1 win, drew comparisons with Van Basten's legendary Netherlands effort. Dutchman Jol said: "It was better than you think. He controlled it on his chest and put it in the other corner. "Marco's was very different. You can't compare them, but this was better!" Van Basten's goal against the Soviet Union in the final of Euro 88 is widely held to be the greatest ever scored at any European Championship finals. He met Arnold Muhren's deep cross on the volley almost at the byeline and powered a dipping shot over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. Kasami considers his strike to be the best of his career. "I have never scored a better goal," said the Switzerland international. "I ran into the space and the pass was perfect. It was an unbelievable goal and I am very pleased." The strike even prompted Jack Wilshere, who scored a superb goal of his own in Arsenal's win over Norwich on Saturday, to tweet:Â  "Well there's my 'goal of the month' prize gone!!!! Take a bow!" Having climbed to 14th, within one point of eighth-placed Manchester United, Jol admitted it was a vital victory for his team. Fulham went behind to Adrian Mariappa's early header before Kasami's 19th-minute goal proved the catalyst for a stirring comeback. "It was unbelievably important to get a result," said Jol. "It was a game of importance for Palace, too, but we needed the three points. "The goal we conceded was sickening, but we showed some response and it was a fantastic Pajtim goal with his wrong foot. I haven't seen him do that before. It is one of the goals of the season." Fulham midfielder Steve Sidwell, who followed up Kasami's strike with a memorable 25-yard volley of his own, believes the win has taken the pressure off Jol. "Going a goal down early was a bit of a blow but we knew, if we kept plugging away, chances would come," Sidwell told Sky Sports 1. Sidwell said Kasami's strike helped inspire the Fulham players. "We needed something special to get back into the game and it certainly was something special," said Sidwell. </body>

      <title>Chelsea boss Mourinho charged by FA</title>
      <description>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is charged with improper conduct by the FA for his behaviour in the win against Cardiff.</description>

      <body>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association for his behaviour in the win against Cardiff on Saturday. Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting. "I don't know why the referee stopped me doing my work," the Portuguese said before the charge was announced. The 50-year-old, who went to sit with fans in the stand, has until 18:00 BST on 24 October to respond to the charge. "To be with the fans was not funny," Mourinho said in Dusseldorf airport ahead of Tuesday's Champions League group match with Schalke. "It is frustrating. You want to communicate with the players and you couldn't do it." Mourinho's dismissal was not the only controversial moment in the match. Eden Hazard scored Chelsea's equaliser in the 4-1 victory after Samuel Eto'o had kicked the ball away from Bluebirds goalkeeper David Marshall as he bounced it. According to Fifa rules, Cardiff should have been awarded a free-kick, but referee Taylor incorrectly allowed play to continue. When asked about the incident on Monday, Mourinho preferred to concentrate on apparent time-wasting from Malky Mackay's side. "If I was in that game and I was paying my ticket, I would be worried with the fact that every time the ball was out or stopped and our opponent had to put the ball back in the game, it took a median (average) of 21.5 seconds," he said. "That is a waste of money. "When you multiply that by the number of times the game was stopped, you pay for 90 minutes but you see 55 or 60. For me, that's breaking the rules." When he did get around to addressing the Eto'o incident, he called it an "intelligent action" and disagreed with the Fifa law governing the incident. "If, in this moment, Fifa says that it's a foul, it's a foul," said Mourinho. "But I think Samuel did well. Maybe the referee did wrong, I don't know to be fair. But in my opinion, that should be allowed." Mourinho was last ordered to the stands in May, when he was still Real Madrid manager. He protested after a decision went against his team in the Copa del Rey final defeat by city rivals Atletico. </body>

      <body>Warren Gatland has named three uncapped players in Wales' autumn 2013 squad. They are Scarlets scrum-half Rhodri Williams, Cardiff Blues centre Cory Allen and Ospreys wing Eli Walker. Perpignan utility back James Hook and lock team-mate Luke Charteris return along with Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland. Jamie Roberts (ankle) is injured and Alex Cuthbert is out after suffering a leg injury in the Blues' Heineken Cup win over Toulon at the weekend. In-from Scarlet Scott Williams is tipped to fill that centre spot alongside Jonathan Davies while Walker's chances of a Test debut are boosted by British and Irish Lion Cuthbert's absence. Blues centre Owen Williams and fly-half Rhys Patchell stay involved at senior level having been among a host of fresh faces who drew their June Test series in Japan 1-1. Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips also remains, having toured Japan. Phillips' former Parc y Scarlets hooking rival, Matthew Rees, is out of contention as he is scheduled to undergo testicular surgery that has forced him to take time out from the game. Ospreys tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis returns after recovering from a knee injury suffered during Wales' 2012 autumn series. Walker was named in Wales' 2013 Six Nations squad, but injuries forced him out and he also missed the trip to Japan. Blues centre Allen comes in after impressive early-season form, including a fine performance in their triumph over European champions Toulon. An unexpected consideration for Gatland was Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips having to go in front of the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations that he attended a video analysis session while under the influence of alcohol. If found guilty, the player could face a club suspension and fine, but that would not affect Phillips' Wales availability. However, the emergence of former Wales Under-20 scrum-half Williams is a big plus. The Ammanford product has won selection for Scarlets' Heineken Cup matches against Harlequins and Racing Metro ahead of two other promising number nines, Gareth Davies and Aled Davies. Wales' series kicks off against South Africa on 9 November, continuing against Argentina on 16 November, Tonga the following Friday, and against Australia eight days later on 30 November. Gatland said: "We have an important campaign ahead as we look to test ourselves against some of the best sides in the world but also add strength in depth to our squad as we look to the future. "We face a huge game against South Africa first up and they will be coming to us after an impressive Rugby Championship campaign. "Recent matches between us have been very close and physical and that will be a great test for us to kick-off. "All four matches will be a stern test but we are looking forward to the challenge and looking forward to seeing what we can do on this stage. "The Rugby World Cup is less than two years away, so we are looking to build as much depth in our squad as possible and to give vital international experience to our players." South Africa announce their squad on Monday, 28 October. Forwards: Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Adam Jones (Ospreys), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Paul James (Bath), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Bevington (Ospreys), Richard Hibbard (Ospreys), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Luke Charteris (Perpignan), Ian Evans (Ospreys), Bradley Davies (Cardiff Blues), Andrew Coombs (Dragons), Ryan Jones (Ospreys), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), Toby Faletau (Dragons), Dan Lydiate (Racing Metro). Backs: Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Bayonne), Lloyd Williams (Cardiff Blues), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Patchell (Cardiff Blues), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Jon Davies (Scarlets), Ashley Beck (Ospreys), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Owen Williams (Cardiff Blues), James Hook (Perpignan), George North (Northampton Saints), Eli Walker (Ospreys), Leigh Halfpenny (Cardiff Blues), Liam Williams (Scarlets). </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the classic vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaron (a light meringue biscuit), the tarte aux pommes (apple tart) or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaron with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macarons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-Ã -Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." </body>

      <title>Pink Lady v the British apple</title>
      <description>It's the height of the British apple season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24578762</url>

      <body>National Apple Day marks the height of the British season, but are home-grown varieties in danger from vigorously marketed foreign rivals like Pink Lady and Jazz, asks Sebastian Oake. How many people will be popping down to the shops today for an old-fashioned apple? Maybe some Cox's Orange Pippin, Egremont Russet or Worcester Pearmain? But you'll be lucky to find more than one or two traditional British varieties - those that were originally bred in the UK and are still grown on British soil. These are in danger of becoming dwindling heritage curiosities, ousted from both shops and orchards by new names. Sales of Cox, Russet and Worcester have been falling year-on-year, while Gala and Braeburn have been rising. Gala, with its spin-off Royal Gala, is now the biggest-selling eating apple grown in the UK and total sales, including imports, are more than four times that of Cox. But it's an apple of New Zealand origin. Braeburn too was first grown in New Zealand but now has a foot in the door of British orchards. And two more recently developed varieties from Down Under are set to complete the takeover of the market. Jazz is another New Zealand apple, produced in the 1980s by crossing Gala and Braeburn. Trial plantings began in England in 2002 with volume production achieved by 2007. Pink Lady was bred in Australia in 1973 as a cross between Lady Williams and Golden Delicious. It became available in British shops in the early 1990s. Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady - the Antipodean Four - are now increasingly dominating apple shelves in the UK, but why? Tastes are changing, says Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, a trade association for the industry. "People want sweeter apples, they want a crunchier texture and they want a good skin finish. That's why many new varieties have become successful." English Apples and Pears represents the bulk of the commercial orchard acreage in England. Its members currently grow about 25 apple varieties. Of those just nine are what might be called "old English". Barlow looks back to when the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. The door was opened to imports of Granny Smith and Golden Delicious, which took market share from Cox. Now these two are themselves in decline, victims also of the Antipodean Four. Worldwide Fruit, a marketing and distribution company, controls the Jazz brand in the UK. Commercial director Steve Maxwell says: "There is definitely a long-term trend - the market for Cox is declining. Pink Lady and Jazz are consistent. Week in, week out, they always deliver on flavour." The shift towards Pink Lady and Jazz certainly isn't about price. Pink Lady can be anything up to twice the price of Cox. In Tesco last week, Braeburn was Â£1.95/kg, Cox Â£1.75/kg and Pink Lady Â£3.50/kg. Some believe that lack of choice in supermarkets is behind the shift in tastes. Among those who are scathing is Common Ground, a charity that champions local distinctiveness. It set up National Apple Day in 1990. "Supermarkets say they're responsive to consumer demand but I don't know how that operates," says Adrian Cooper, director of Common Ground. "If the range available in the shops is limited, then how do we express our demand? It's very difficult to know if the change in the market is due to changes in consumer taste or whether it's driven by a different force." There's no doubt that some apples are more profitable to produce than others. A single Gala tree reportedly produces a higher yield than native English varieties and a much higher proportion of Gala fruit passes as Class I fruit than Cox. The apples are just the right size, shape and colour to get top price. Supermarkets rarely sell Class II. There's little question too that in today's all-year-round market, supermarkets prefer not to fiddle about. For them, it's easier to place a contract with a single distribution company able to supply the same apple whatever the time of year, using different growing regions around the world in rotation. Worldwide Fruit can supply Royal Gala, Braeburn, Jazz and Pink Lady, 12 months a year. By contrast, it can supply Worcester Pearmain only in September. One huge factor in the snakes-and-ladders world of apples is the degree to which a variety is marketed and the muscle behind it. This is where Jazz and Pink Lady differ from many other varieties. To be accurate, Jazz and Pink Lady are not apple varieties but commercial brands. Jazz is the trademark brand name for the variety Scifresh. It was developed through a collaboration between Enza, formerly the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and Plant and Food Research, a New Zealand research institute, and can only be grown under licence. In the UK it is controlled by Worldwide Fruit, itself part owned by Enza. Pink Lady is also a trademark - the actual variety is Cripps Pink. The brand is owned and licensed by Apple and Pear Australia. It is grown, with permission, in a range of countries but not in the UK. UK growers are not allowed to grow it because the trademark holder is worried the climate will not do it justice. The effort put into pushing brands like Pink Lady is phenomenal. The apple has a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. Women dressed up as apples have been targeting people at London stations and there has been a tie-in with Great Ormond Street Hospital. There is a logo for the apple, an official slogan ("so much more than an apple") and even the Pink Lady Club to sign up to. Through that you can access a chatroom, events and in-store promotions and, in a sign that much of the marketing is targeting children, the Pink Lady Club provides party packs (including the "Pink Lady apple song"), activity sheets and kids' recipes. Parents can even upload a picture of their child eating a Pink Lady apple to the Pink Lady website. In 2011 the people behind the Pink Lady brand promotion won an award from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. It's worth noting too that in all official material relating to the brand, the words Pink Lady come with an inseparable R in a circle reminding us all that this is Pink LadyÂ® and someone's commercial property. Even the slogan "so much more than an apple" is trademarked. It all sounds a world away, and perhaps it is, from the classic image of an old English orchard.

      <title>Six tricks to revive old food</title>
      <description>Tesco has revealed more than two thirds of salad grown for bags is thrown out. What can be done to prolong the life of food?</description>

      <body>Tesco has revealed more than two thirds of salad grown for bags is thrown out. What can be done to prolong the life of food, asks Kathryn Westcott. Forty per cent of apples and just under half of bakery items are also uneaten. So what kitchen tricks can help? Dampen the outside of a loaf of bread that has gone hard with a little bit of water and pop it in a hot oven - about 180C (350F) - for about five or 10 minutes, says food writer Stefan Gates. Baguettes that are past their best are regularly cut into 1/2cm slices in the Gates' household and put into a warm oven (about 50C, 120F) for about 15 to 20 minutes. "We use them as a form of biscuit for cheese," says Gates. "They can be stored in a sealed plastic bag." Limp biscuits can also be revived in the oven. Five minutes in a hot oven (180C, 350F) should do it. This new-found freshness won't last, though. There are a number of tricks for keeping lettuce fresh and crisp. Lovefoodhatewaste.com suggests separating the leaves and storing them in a bowl of water in the fridge. Replace the water every couple of days. Culinary tips and tricks blog The Kitchn, however, favours the "bath towel method", which entails cutting up greens, washing them, putting them in a salad spinner and spreading them on a clean towel to air dry for a few hours. Roll up the towel with the greens inside and secure with rubber bands. Just take out what you need for that day and bundle it up again, it suggests. "Packet lettuce is preserved in gas and once it starts to go off, nothing will revive it," says chef Clarissa Dickson Wright. But she says a Cos or Little Gem can be revived by leaving in really cold water - maybe with some ice cubes in - and leaving overnight." Otherwise, she says, make lettuce soup. "Fry some onion and garlic, add stock and toss in the lettuce leaves. Top with croutons made from your old bread," she says. Cucumber that has gone limp can be revived by chopping off the end and standing it in cold water, according to Love Food Hate Waste. It also suggests freezing cheese and milk. Grate the cheese first and then put it straight from the freezer into sauces or lasagnes, etc. Dickson Wright also suggests freezing bananas for ice cream. Peel them first then whizz them in a food processor. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>UK aims to claw back EU welfare cash</title>

      <body>The UK is examining ways to claw back welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries from their home government, the BBC understands. A levy could be put in place so that for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, the government would be able to reclaim any benefits paid out. The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was "possible to return to the system". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a "right to reside" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be "habitually resident". Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims "might not raise huge sums," the senior Foreign Office source said, "but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring. In January 2014, restrictions that have applied to migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK will expire. Meanwhile, the UK is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK. It is alleged the extra UK "right to reside" test to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. The government has said it will fight the court case robustly. Ministers are keen to be seen to be adopting a muscular approach to immigration, given how big a priority opinion polls suggest it is to many voters, and the recent strong performances of the UK Independence Party. </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Avonmouth, Gloucs, are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said levels of capital spending had actually been cut and progress to date was not good enough. Only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date, the opposition said. "At a time when we need to invest in infrastructure to create jobs and boost living standards, and strengthen our economy for the long term, this is an appalling record," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. The CBI and other business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. </body>

      <body>MPs are debating government plans to toughen up the immigration system by making landlords question tenants about their status and cutting bank account access for those in the UK illegally. Ministers also want to make it easier to deport foreign criminals and cut the number of grounds for appeal. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the changes will put the system "on the side" of those who abide by the law. But Labour has tabled several amendments to the Immigration Bill. The government's plans, announced earlier this month, include: The bill is undergoing its second reading debate, during which MPs discuss the main principles. The government says it will help the aim of reducing net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to fewer than 100,000 a year. But Labour said the bill offered "nothing" to deal with exploitation of illegal workers or problems at border controls. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will propose several amendments, including: There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000, but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was closer to 1.1 million. </body>

      <description>Are people getting too snobbish about frozen food?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551578</url>

      <body>A new series captures what life is like at frozen food retailer Iceland, but are some of us a little bit snooty in our attitude to frozen food? Google it and you'll see there have been dozens of attempts to establish whether fresh or frozen vegetables are better for you. Many cite a US Food and Drug Administration report from 1998 that established frozen was better than fresh. Advocates of frozen say the process prevents nutrient loss occurring in transport. Even those who plump for fresh admit that frozen vegetables are still a healthy option. And yet there's a marked degree of antipathy towards frozen food. "Iceland is a classic British institution that half the country loves and half the country hates. Half of the population absolutely hate it without ever having, in most cases, been in a shop or bought a product," says Keith Hann, PR consultant for Iceland Foods. "In a word, snobbery." For some, frozen food conjures up images of Mike Leigh's 1977 drama Abigail's Party, with kitsch dishes such as defrosted prawn cocktail, vol-au-vents and black forest gateau, not forgetting the staple of any 70s dinner party - the Arctic roll. Brian Young, director general of the British Frozen Food Federation (BFFF), says he senses a chill in the air when it comes to the British public's opinion of frozen food. "Pretty much every food manufacturer will do blind testing of their product and every blind test that I've known, particularly on fish and other products, will ask the consumer to compare two samples side by side and nearly always they prefer the frozen variety. "If you then show them the packaging and you show it was a frozen product or a fresh product, they then nearly always choose the fresh one, even though they have just tasted something that was significantly better." Price could be a factor, suggests Young. "[Frozen food] can be produced much more efficiently than a fresh or a chilled counterpart, so it finishes up that the price of the product is quite often significantly less. People associate the fact that if you looked at two pizzas and one was Â£2.50 and one was Â£1.50 you naturally assume the Â£2.50 one is better quality." Cutting down on waste in the supply chain is one of the biggest advantages of freezing, says Young. But he also claims there are health benefits. Research conducted recently by Chester University and Leatherhead Food Research - and funded by the BFFF - found in two out of three cases frozen fruit and vegetables contained more antioxidants and nutrients than fresh produce. "They are losing their vitamins, they are losing their antioxidants the minute they come out of the ground or you pick them off the plant or tree, so by freezing them you lock in that goodness for longer," says Young. However Michael Barker, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, says consumers do like the taste and that "just picked" look of fresh produce. "It's true scientifically that you do start to lose [some] nutrients as soon as the product is picked, but I don't think it's such a massive loss that you're not still getting those nutrients. It's still an incredibly healthy product to eat regardless of whether it's fresh or frozen," says Barker. He says fresh and frozen are not rivals when it comes to the food chain. "The number of fruit and vegetables, and particularly fruit, that you find frozen is relatively limited. You think about the biggest selling fruits - bananas, oranges, apples, pears - you don't really see these in frozen formats." Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have both used frozen vegetables in recipes on their cookery programmes. But David Gray, analyst at Planet Retail, rejects the idea that frozen food has any type of image problem. "Frozen food is a lot more popular than it used to be, a lot more common," says Gray. "It is seen as good value for money by consumers." He believes the industry's reputation was knocked recently by the horse meat scandal which affected frozen meat products, but predicts frozen food sales will keep rising. He also says frozen food could expand into discount stores. Some pound stores are already starting to sell a small selection of frozen food. There has even been a resurgence in the popularity of some retro classics such as chicken Kiev - eaten by Don Draper in the 1960s inspired TV series Mad Men. As well as expanding into new areas of the high street, frozen food manufacturers and retailers are also now offering consumers new ranges at the top end of the market. For example, frozen food store Cook sells handmade food for the freezer. Beef wellingtons are priced at Â£20 for two portions, and on the packet you will find the name of the chef who prepared the dish before it was frozen. Food critic and regular on BBC's Masterchef Kate Spicer says there is a "revolution in home cooked food being sold on to people". She advocates schemes such as buying homemade food from a neighbour who has more time to spare to prepare meals which can then be frozen. When it comes down to it the British public are not snobbish about the method of preservation, she says. "There's frozen food and there's frozen food, and I think a lot of it has to do with the brand on the box and not the fact that it's frozen," says Spicer.

      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>What's the point of the Rugby League World Cup?</title>
      <description>Why the Rugby League World Cup is worth watching</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/24580494</url>

      <body>Bang. That is how you are supposed to start month-long sports competitions. Grab the public's attention and take them on an incident-packed journey to a climactic contest for the big prize. The organisers of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup must have missed that memo. They opted for a double-header in Paris and Ireland versus Samoa in rugby league hotbed Belfast, before finally getting to England against Australia at a half-empty Twickenham. Stretched across 27 venues in six countries, the 12th Rugby League World Cup was a textbook case of how not to do it. The most ambitious tournament in the sport's history - and the last Rugby World Cup to be held in the northern hemisphere - lost nearly Â£700,000. "We don't want to dwell too much on 2000. We have put it behind us," says RFL chief executive Nigel Wood. "There is a different team of executives now and we think there's a groundswell of optimism coming into the competition." To be fair, the 2013 edition, which starts in Cardiff on Saturday, looks very different: fewer teams and venues, a proper organising committee, a host-city bidding process, an innovative format and what promises to be a decent England team. But more important than the tweaks, and the possibility of a first British win since 1972, is the sense that this World Cup might be the first to work out what it is for. Having started in France in 1954 - 33 years before those conservative, rugby union types got their acts together - rugby league's big show had already been through about half a dozen changes by the time it got to its 11th instalment in 1995. Having doubled the number of teams to 10, the organisers otherwise played it safe by mainly keeping to northern England. The tournament is fondly remembered as a fitting party for rugby league's 100th birthday. But did it grow the game? Did anybody who was not already a committed fan notice? How did it compare to union's upstart competition? Â  Does it matter that only three teams ever look like winning the thing? Rugby league's bosses thought they knew the answers, and they did not like them. The message was clear for 2000, it seemed, standing still is dying. The result was Frankenstein's monster: an unloved competition of improbable dimensions and no sense of its own identity. OK, the organisers could not help the rain, or that the Hatfield rail crash just before the tournament made north-south travel in England very tricky. Neither could they do much about Australia being so good they should have been made to play with 12 men. But there can be no mitigation for staging New Zealand versus Lebanon (a team made up of Australians of Lebanese descent) in the rugby union stronghold of Gloucester, or Scotland against Aotearoa Maori Â  (a New Zealand second team) at a football ground in Glasgow. The total attendance of those two games was 4,504. Crowds, or the lack of them, were an issue throughout, which is not surprising when you consider how many games were played in football grounds, and how few were contests - only eight of the 31 matches finished with winning margins of 10 points or fewer; there were 12 games with margins of more than 40 points. It was expansion for expansion's sake, and floating fans floated away. "There are clearly lessons to be learned," was the understated assessment of former Rugby Football League (RFL) chairman Sir Rodney Walker, speaking after Australia's ninth World Cup victory. "It would be fair to say that there was not much proper planning done," recalls Leeds Rhinos chief executive Gary Hetherington.Â  "A lot of assumptions were made and in hindsight it was a disappointment." It was also a major setback for the game's hopes of replicating rugby union's more global canvas. The Rugby League International Federation, the global governing body, works like a charity with just one big fundraiser every four years. One year of feast, three or four years of development cheques to the sport's minnows. The experience in 2000 was so bruising the World Cup did not come back until 2008 in Australia. It was a success. New Zealand upset the hosts in a memorable final, the tournament made a profit and international rugby league was back. But most significantly, the competition had rediscovered its purpose: a celebration for its loyal fans, and an advertisement to potential fans. "We've got a solid business at Leeds - 15,000 fans who come week in, week out," explains Hetherington. "If the World Cup disappoints that won't change. But if it goes well, there are potential spin-offs for everybody. "We're bringing the world's best players to our neck of the woods and I'm sure some of them will end up in Super League Â  next season. "We can also see from the ticket sales for our two games (New Zealand-Papua New Guinea and a quarter-final) that a lot of people will be coming to their first rugby league game." Hetherington says 60% of the first 4,000 tickets sold at Headingley went to people not on the Rhinos' computer system. That might be because their fans were more focused on the Super League play-offs, but it tallies with a figure of one in four tickets across all 21 venues going to new fans. "It's fantastic that so many tickets have been sold to people outside the heartland," says Leeds and England captain Kevin Sinfield. "I would say to people who are new to the sport 'come with an open mind and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you see'. The athletes on show, the ferocity, the skill level - people will be bowled away by it." The organisers have set themselves a target of 500,000 tickets across the 28 games - double the amount sold in 2000. Whether they get there or not will depend on how Sinfield's men fare, and the tournament's new structure. The game's best eight teams are divided between two groups, with three quarter-final slots available in each group. The remaining two places in the last eight will go to the winners of groups C and D, six emerging nations who have fought through pre-qualifying to be here. The idea is to avoid the blow-outs that have marred other World Cups - in both codes - and to give every team a chance of scoring tries, and hopefully winning a game. Could this be the next league brainwave to crop up in union at some point? The mix of venues is smarter than 2000's, too. It starts big with a double-header at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium - rugby league's trump card, England against Australia, followed by Wales versus Italy - and then heads to the heartlands of Hull and Warrington on Sunday for Papua New Guinea v France and New Zealand-Samoa. "That's a seductive offering in anybody's language," says Wood. "We'll have a good idea of where we are after that." England's next group game against Ireland in Huddersfield is the first sell-out, with the final at Old Trafford not far behind, and tickets going fast for the two games in the south of France, a traditional league stronghold. In fact, the only real departures from the tried-and-tested list are Bristol Â  and Limerick, but both came through a bidding process, which means the local authorities want this to work and are sharing the marketing load. The semi-finals are a double-header at Wembley, but even with fans getting a two-for-the-price-of-one deal the overall numbers should at least double the crowds at 2000's semi-finals. Barely 25,000 went to those. And then there is the television audience. "This is the best national team for 25 years and they're going to be on the BBC every weekend for five, hopefully six, weeks. That will elevate the team's profile, the players and the sport," says Hetherington. That assessment of England came a few days before the shock defeat by Italy in a warm-up game on Saturday. Everybody associated with rugby league, even the most ardent Australia fan, will be hoping that was an aberration. Having only three genuine contenders for a contest purporting to be a "World" anything is fine (how many teams can really win football's World Cup next year?), but losing one would hurt, particularly if it is the home team. World Cups of any variety need a bit of parochialism. It will be exactly the same when union's World Cup is staged in England in 2015, but a run to the final for Stuart Lancaster's men would see the other code enjoy blanket media coverage. Can that be said of England in this World Cup? "There's not a lot of mileage in peering over the garden fence and looking at somebody else's vegetable patch," counters Wood. "We know we've got a good patch of our own. "Of course, we'd like greater exposure and revenues, but we are confident that this will be the best World Cup our sport has ever put on." It is a sentiment shared by a man who narrowly missed out on selection for England's 24-man squad, Jon Wilkin. But the St Helens star's ambitions for the tournament are two-fold. "From a playing side, it's simple: win the tournament. But for the wider game, there's a huge opportunity to take the sport on to a national level, give the papers and news programmes a reason to mention rugby league," says Wilkin. "But we've got to be ready to deal with the increased interest that would come with success. So that would be the real success, creating awareness and then dealing with it." So rugby league wants its own Jonny Wilkinson moment, but must be ready to adapt when it comes? "I think we need to let go a bit," explains Wilkin. "Rugby league needs to escape the working-class bubble it has lived and blossomed in. And I mean that in the nicest way. "If you look at the history of our game, factory-owners in the north used to pay people to play for their factory teams. "We're still a community-based sport. Essentially the rugby clubs have become the factories, the chairmen are the owners, the players are the workforce and the fans are the customers. So we've not got away from that model. "That's great because we still have a fantastic community game, but I'm a big believer in breaking down those social barriers to let our game grow, and I think part of that is our passionate support relinquishing a bit of control." So there you have it. The Rugby League World Cup aims to be a long and enjoyable party and like all the best parties it's about letting go and making new friends. Enjoy. </body>

      <body>To fans of motor racing the banked section of crumbling road in the above picture is instantly recognisable as the home of British motorsport, Brooklands. This was the site of the first purpose-built motor racing circuit anywhere in the world, and one that in its heyday in the 1920s and '30s saw thousands of fans lining the track, hoping to catch a glimpse of those pioneering racers. The course was built in 1907 with sections of concrete banking to allow the cars to reach higher speeds than would otherwise have been possible. The design ensured it was the site of a number of land speed records and was home to the first British Grand Prix in 1927. Alongside its motoring heritage it was also home to aviation pioneers, and by the start of World War II the site was given over to use by Vickers-Armstrongs and Hawker aircraft companies. Sadly, motor racing never returned to the site, though TV presenter James May did attempt to build the biggest Scalextric track along the route. Photographer Douglas Kurn lives locally and decided to undertake the task of documenting the remains of the Brooklands circuit. To contrast with the noise and speed of a race day, Douglas chose to shoot the project at night to give a peaceful, surreal feel to the images. Some of the exposures ran well past the hour and in total the project has taken four years to complete. The Spirit of Brooklands was chosen by the Association of Photographers for its online exhibition of members' work, and a selection of prints was recently exhibited at the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge. You can see more of Douglas Kurn's work on his website. </body>

      <description>Papers assess 'health tourism' data</description>

      <body>Research on the effects of so-called health tourism by overseas patients on the NHS in England is explored in Tuesday's newspapers. The Daily Mail is adamant that "Britain can't afford to treat the world" and it applauds Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for his efforts to claw back some of the money. The Times is more cautious, noting that the Department of Health admits that the figures are "based on a large number of assumptions". In its front page coverage of the story, the Daily Telegraph focuses on the reported Â£2bn annual cost to the NHS for treating foreign patients. Meanwhile, the Guardian reports the claims were challenged by Labour, while doctors have raised concerns that they did not have the capacity to "act as border guards". Elsewhere, the deal for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point and the political row about energy prices continues to generate coverage. The Daily Telegraph is concerned that British taxpayers are paying over the odds in subsidies to foreign-owned energy companies for nuclear power. But it accepts the deal with French-owned EDF to build and run the plant is a "price worth paying to keep the lights on", concluding that energy policy has been a shambles for decades. The Guardian fears the decision to subsidise state-owned Chinese and French companies shows "a huge lack of belief in UK competence". It also suggests that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey had no choice but to go nuclear at any price because of the chancellor's resistance to spending more on other forms of renewable energy. The Times saves its ire for the energy companies whose price hikes it says have pushed family bills to unaffordable levels. The paper says the government ought to have fought harder for better terms from EDF. According to the Sun, the architects of the energy crisis are not the suppliers but "feeble and dithering politicians" . It believes the "blame falls squarely on Labour", saying it had 13 years to solve energy problems but only vaguely put its faith in wind farms and failed to sign off any new nuclear plants. The Daily Mirror has what it describes as a "white widow exclusive", carrying a front page picture it says is of terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite cuddling her newborn baby daughter. It comes almost a month after Interpol issued a wanted persons notice for the Briton, whose husband was one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005. A new study which suggests that insomnia or restless sleep could be linked to Alzheimer's in older people is quoted in the Daily Telegraph. The Times wonders whether poor sleep could play a role in causing dementia rather than simply being a symptom, something the researchers have stopped short of demonstrating. Finally, the Daily Express says middle aged men everywhere are facing an anxious wait for what it hopes will be "hair-raising" final results of clinical trials to find a cure for baldness. It is among the papers to report that tests on mice suggest it is possible to grow new hair follicles from human skin cells, a major development from the current system of transplanting hair follicles. While the Daily Mail cautions against waiting with bated breath for a treatment that is years away, the Independent says it is a cause for celebration. The techniques used in this study give a glimpse, it believes, of the future of medicine saying "in the 21st century, it will be the turn of regenerative medicines based on cell transplants". </body>
