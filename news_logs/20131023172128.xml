      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Private christening for baby prince</title>
      <description>The christening of Prince George, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, has taken place in London.</description>

      <body>The christening of Prince George has taken place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London. The prince, third in line to the throne, was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The christening was private, with only senior royals, four members of the Middleton family, the seven godparents and their spouses among the 22 guests. Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was born in London on 22 July. The duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. The godparents, announced earlier, are Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall. Mrs Tindall, wife of former England rugby player Mike Tindall, is Prince William's cousin, while the other six godparents are all friends of the royal couple. Prince George was baptised in a replica of the lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The duke and duchess chose two hymns, two lessons and two anthems for the christening. The hymns were Breathe on Me, Breath of God and Be Thou My Vision. Lessons from St Luke and St John were read by Pippa Middleton and Prince Harry, and the anthems were Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand and the Lord Bless You and Keep You. The anthems were sung by the Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, which performed at the royal couple's wedding. After the ceremony, celebrity photographer Jason Bell was expected to take a picture of the Queen and princes Charles, William and George together. This will echo a 1894 picture from the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother - George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. The picture is expected to be released on Thursday morning. </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police are appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Commitee. The meeting took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where Mr Mitchell was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked" during the meeting. The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. The officers have since said they regret giving the statement, but Mr Mitchell's allies have dubbed this a "regretful non-apology" and called for root-and-branch changes to increase police accountability. Asked whether he believed the apology should be the end of the matter, former policing minister Nick Herbert said: "No, I don't think it is enough." The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The wording of the IPCC report, let's just remind ourselves, was incredibly strong. "They suggest that the police officers gave a false account, that there was a deliberate attempt to discredit Andrew Mitchell, that their motives seem plain: they were pursuing a political agenda. "Now when the independent body says this, it is surely right that action is taken and it is very unsatisfactory that we have a situation where the leadership of the police force appears to disagree and take no action in spite of the view of the independent body that was set up to deal with complaints." Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <title>British links to al-Shabab revealed</title>
      <description>A list of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Somali militants al-Shabab - and related organisations - is compiled by the BBC.</description>

      <body>The names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to al-Shabab - and related organisations - have been established by the BBC. Most of those on the list travelled to Somalia to fight or attempted to do so. Somali-based militants al-Shabab carried out the deadly attack on the Westgate mall in neighbouring Kenya. Lawyers for the family of one British recruit known to have died in Somalia are investigating whether he was killed in a raid involving western military. Al-Shabab is fighting to impose a brutal version of Islamic law on the country and the group is linked to al-Qaeda. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad, and further first-hand research and accounts. It is not a complete list of people from the UK who are suspected of having gone to fight in the region. The research found that security chiefs believe at least 32 of the identifiable individuals went to fight. A further seven were named in British court cases as having attempted to enter Somalia, but their plans were discovered and disrupted. Others have been accused or convicted of raising money for al-Shabab, or facilitating the travel of others. Seven people on the list returned to the UK - but the fate of most of the others is completely unknown. Four of the men on the list are known to be dead, including men who featured on a video released by the group a week ago. The video included a message from a young man named as "Talha", who asked Muslims in Tower Hamlets - a borough in east London - to join the jihad in Somalia. Talha, whose real name was Taufail Ahmed, died in Somalia in November 2012. The Foreign Office said it had confirmed the death to his family, who are of Bangladeshi origin. He grew up in Stepney Green in east London. The BBC has tracked down people who knew him at school. They say he fell into a life of gang crime before leaving that world behind in favour of an extreme interpretation of Islam, before disappearing from the UK. "For British Muslims he's doing a disservice," said one former schoolmate. "For Muslims around the world, he is doing a disservice." In the al-Shabab video, the narrator says that "Talha" died after an attack involving American and British forces. The government has not commented on that claim but his family has asked the legal charity Reprieve to investigate. "The family were notified by British police officers. The FCO [Foreign Office] have knowledge of the incident and have told us that Taufail Ahmed received a Muslim burial," said Kat Craig from Reprieve. "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." </body>

      <title>Husband jailed for cellar girl rapes</title>
      <description>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a domestic servant for nearly a decade are jailed.</description>

      <body>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a servant for nearly a decade have been jailed. Ilyas and Tallat Ashar brought the girl, who is deaf, from Pakistan and kept her at their home in Eccles, Salford, where she slept in the cellar. Ilyas Ashar, 84, who was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, was jailed for 13 years at Manchester Crown Court. Tallat Ashar, 68, convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking, got five years. Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family. The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity. Ilyas Ashar was also found guilty of benefit fraud and trafficking. Judge Peter Lakin, sentencing, said the couple had not shown any remorse. He said: "You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. "You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. You exploited her physically, mentally and economically. "There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity - you two took that away from her, you consigned her to a life of misery and degradation." He added: "You are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people." The victim was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family and also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. The court heard a proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. The couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was given a 12-month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work after she was also found guilty of benefit fraud. The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned, the court heard. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language, enabling her to be interviewed by police. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said an appropriate name would be "Miss Courageous" after she spent 34 days in total being cross-examined. He said: "She is a remarkable young woman, a young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court." The passport used to allow the girl into the UK claimed she was 20, and it was a matter of "mystery and concern" how immigration officials at Heathrow did not spot the difference in age, he said. Those involved in her development since her discovery have described her progress like "a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis". </body>

      <title>Vatican suspends 'bishop of bling'</title>
      <description>The Vatican suspends a German bishop dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over alleged lavish spending, including a $42m renovation of his home.</description>

      <body>The Vatican has suspended a senior German Church leader dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over his alleged lavish spending. Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is accused of spending more than 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on renovating his official residence. The Vatican said it deemed "appropriate... a period of leave from the diocese" for the bishop. The suspension comes two days after he met the Pope to discuss the matter. "A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties", a Vatican statement said. It said a Church commission would rule on the matter, but did not say where Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would go or what he would do while the inquiry was held. The head of Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, Alois Glueck, welcomed the Vatican's decision. He said: "Pope Francis's decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation has become an increasing burden for the faithful there, and in all of Germany, over recent weeks." Bishop Tebartz-van Elst - and his spending habits - had become infamous in Germany, where many people pay Church tax to the state. The tax raised 5.2bn euros for Catholics and 4.6bn euros for Protestants in 2012. Calls were made for the bishop to resign after he was accused of lying under oath about his spending. He was criticised for a first-class flight to India to visit the poor. But his official residence is at the heart of the criticism, after renovations were originally costed at 5.5m euros. German media are reporting that the residence was fitted with a bath that cost 15,000 euros, a conference table for 25,000 euros and a private chapel that cost 2.9m euros. The story has attracted heavy coverage and has stoked controversy among Catholics. It was in Germany that Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. The BBC's Alan Johnston, in Rome, says all this was bound to play badly with the new Pope, who has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of senior clerics whose lifestyles seem a little too lavish. Pope Francis has also signalled his intention to clean up the Vatican's finances, appointing a commission to advise him on reforms. There is no surprise in Rome that the Vatican has ordered the bishop's suspension from his duties while the spending row is investigated, our correspondent adds. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the daughter of a Protestant pastor, said that she had expressed "hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church". In his absence, the bishop's diocese will be administered by Limburg's vicar general, Wolfgang Roesch. </body>

      <title>Parking ticket 'grace' period urged</title>
      <description>Councils in England should give drivers five minutes grace after their parking tickets run out before fining them, a committee of MPs says.</description>

      <body>Drivers should be given "five minutes grace" after their parking tickets expire before facing fines, MPs on the Commons transport committee say. It also said councils in England should publish annual parking-charge accounts if they want to prove they are not being used as a "cash cow" The Transport Committee warned it was "neither acceptable nor legal" to use fines to increase revenue. Councils made a surplus of hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it added. The MPs urged ministers to freeze charges, currently capped at £130 in London and £70 outside. Councils said money raised went back into services. Committee chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said: "There is a deep-rooted public perception that parking enforcement is used as a cash cow, so it's essential that local authorities apply stringent transparency." The report said the Local Government Association had calculated a surplus from on- and off-street parking of £411m in 2011/12, while the RAC Foundation put the figure at £565m. The maximum fixed penalty for speeding is £60, unless the case is referred to court. Mrs Ellman argued the charging system was perverse, saying: "Annual parking accounts would allow the public to see how much local revenue is derived from the enforcement of fines, and what proportion of this come from on- or off-street parking charges. "It's right that parking charges be determined locally, but hard to justify fines that substantially exceed penalties for more serious offences like speeding. "Central government should freeze the maximum penalty charge and develop differential fines for less serious parking violations. " Mrs Ellman also said the Department for Transport's rules for councils should include a five-minute "grace-and-favour" period after tickets expire before imposing a fine. A government spokesman said: "We welcome this report, which strengthens the case for changes to be made to parking rules. "The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This government is reining in over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair parking practices, with the levels of parking penalty charges being kept under review." But Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said: "As this report recognises, parking controls are not being used by councils to raise revenue. They are essential for keeping motorists and pedestrians safe, traffic flowing and ensure people can park near their homes and local shops." He added: "Councils always look to be open and transparent with residents on their parking policies. "Any income they make from charges and fines is spent on running parking services, fixing potholes and providing subsidised travel to children and the elderly." Last month, the government said it was considering banning fixed cameras and so-called "spy cars" used by councils to catch people parking illegally. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the idea of getting councils to publish figures, saying it would "illuminate what many drivers regard as the murky world of parking policy". "Parking charges are not inherently wrong but they need to be fair, and where penalties are levied they should be proportionate to the 'crime' committed. "Local authorities are struggling with huge financial pressures but so are drivers. It is unacceptable that car users should be singled out as an easy way of shoring up shrinking budgets." </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>

      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>Marine 'executed Afghan prisoner'</title>
      <description>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial of three Royal Marines charged with murder has heard.</description>

      <body>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial has heard. Three Royal Marines, who cannot be named, are charged with murdering the unknown man while on duty in 2011. One of the men, known as Marine A, is accused of shooting the prisoner in the chest at close range. A helmet-mounted camera inadvertently filmed the incident and the footage was shown to the court. The three deny the charges against them. Charges against two further marines - D and E - were dropped in February but the anonymity order granted last year remains in place. Last November, Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett said the defendants would be at "real and immediate risk" from "organised terrorist activity and lone wolves", if their names were made public. Speaking to the board at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, prosecutor David Perry said the murder took place on 15 September 2011 when the three defendants were on active service. "The prosecution case is that Marine A used a pistol and deliberately shot and killed the unknown man. "It was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. The prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution, a field execution," he said. Even though Marine A used the pistol, Marines B and C "encouraged and assisted Marine A in carrying out the killing," he added. Mr Perry said the incident had occurred after a patrol base in Helmand Province had come under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire fired from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, which he described as a legitimate operation. The marines had come across the injured man in a field, the court heard. Marine A wanted to move him from an area where an air balloon, known as a PGSS, was in use for observation. "He knew full well what he was going to do," Mr Perry said. The court heard that after Marine A shot the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol he swore at him and said: "There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." The prosecutor said Marine A then said to the other marines: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention." Mr Perry accused the three defendants of using the Afghan man's injuries as a "cloak" to conceal their own actions, reporting he had died from wounds inflicted by the helicopter. Five recordings caught on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B were shown to the panel. In one conversation between Marine A and C about shooting the man one serviceman is overheard asking "Anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?" before another replies loudly "Nope." In another Marine C was heard asking A if he should shoot the man in the head, which was refused with more offensive language as "obvious". A journal which had been written by Marine C also gave an insight into what happened during the alleged murder, the court heard. The men - who were hidden from view of the public gallery of the courtroom by the use of a screen - were arrested by Royal Military Police last October after civilian police found suspicious footage on a serviceman's laptop in the UK. They are accused of murdering the Afghan national contrary to Section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. The court martial is expected to see further video evidence either later on Wednesday or on Thursday. One clip is said to show a body being moved from an open field to a mound, while another allegedly shows the shooting of the injured man by Marine A. The trial could last up to three weeks. The marines have been released on bail. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <title>Berlusconi to face bribery trial</title>
      <description>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator in 2006.</description>

      <body>Italian ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator. Berlusconi is accused of paying the left-wing senator 3m euros ($3.9m) to defect to his party in 2006 and help bring down the government. The senator, Sergio De Gregorio, was sentenced to 20 months on Wednesday at a plea bargain hearing in Naples. Berlusconi has been embroiled in a number of trials and says he is the victim of a campaign by the judiciary. He has made no immediate comment on the latest ruling. Also charged in the latest case is Berlusconi's former aide, Valter Lavitola, who is accused of being an intermediary in the alleged bribe. The defection of De Gregorio, a senator from Naples, to Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party weakened the government of Romano Prodi, which collapsed in 2008 and triggered elections that returned Berlusconi to power. De Gregorio said on Wednesday: "I urge Silvio Berlusconi to leave the political scene, which would free Italy from a lot of dirt." He added: "I now believe I behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way and was aiming to bring down the Prodi government as part of a sort of holy war being waged by Berlusconi." Mr Lavitola appeared at the Naples hearing, telling it that "there is no proof that I could have known that it was money for a bribe. I would have been simply a conduit". Mr Lavitola was placed under investigation in 2011. He left for South America shortly afterwards and was arrested on his return in April 2012. Berlusconi's supporters have rallied to his defence. PDL lawmaker Daniele Capezzone told Agence France-Presse: "I think Italians fully understand that what has been happening in the past few years is an attack against a political leader who was freely and democratically chosen by millions." The trial is scheduled to start in February. Berlusconi, 77, has faced a series of court cases in recent years. On Saturday a court in Milan banned him from holding public office for two years, following his conviction in August for tax fraud. The ban has still to be voted on in parliament. A cross-party panel of the Italian Senate has also recommended his expulsion from the chamber, which means he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi is currently appealing against convictions for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of power and leaking confidential information. Early this month, Berlusconi suffered political humiliation when forced to perform a U-turn in parliament on a confidence vote. Berlusconi had promised to topple the government of PM Enrico Letta by withdrawing his party's support. But he backed down when it became clear that several of his PDL senators would support the government. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Esytn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>N Ireland 'UK's happiest nation'</title>
      <description>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests.</description>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <body>A cameraman had an unexpected regular visitor while filming seals in Orkney for the BBC's The Great British Year television programme. Raymond Besant was filming a grey seal colony from a hide, but discovered it damaged. To his surprise, he found one of the seal pups hiding inside - and it kept returning. Mr Besant said: "He did have the good grace to get out when he saw me approaching." He explained: "I was filming over a period of three weeks and had a hide positioned at the top of the shore to avoid disturbing the seals too much. "But after two weeks of filming I noticed one morning that the hide looked damaged. "I thought it was just the bad weather but when I opened the back of the hide I found a young seal sleeping inside it." He went on: "The dilemma was how to get him out of the hide, I needed to get on with filming and I didn't want to get bitten. "I gently shook the hide and eventually he shuffled out. He had wrecked the hide, he was still moulting so there was fur everywhere and it smelled pretty bad, like wet dog. "I put some driftwood and things that were lying on the shore across the entrance to stop him coming in again as he had bent the hide poles over so far I couldn't close the entrance properly." "When I came down the next morning I was surprised to see his head poking out again. The wood was no barrier, he just bounced over the top of it. "So I took the driftwood away and decided that if he was going to go in I couldn't stop him. So for a week I arrived each morning to find him there." The wildlife cameraman added: "He was just a clever seal that had found somewhere warm and dry to stay." The footage appears in the autumn programme of The Great British Year which airs on BBC1 at 21:00 on Wednesday and is also available on the iPlayer. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments as to whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments as to whether the city of Detroit should be granted protection from its creditors. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. Union and pension fund representatives will argue against the bankruptcy filing as they want to preserve payments to former city workers. They say that city officials have not properly negotiated with creditors. According to the unions and pension funds, Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, did not hold formal negotiating sessions before filing for bankruptcy. They are also likely to argue that the city is not bankrupt and has assets that can be sold, including pieces from the Detroit Institute of Arts. City managers say they have negotiated in good faith and bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's $18bn in debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. "There are only so many things they can fight about," said John Pottow, a University of Michigan professor who specialises in bankruptcy law. "They can fight about the solvency and they can fight about the negotiating in good faith." Lawyers from both sides will present evidence and call witnesses before the federal bankruptcy judge, Steven Rhodes. He has allotted 10 days for hearings over the next three weeks, although the hearings could take less time than that. He will then decide whether Detroit merits protection from its creditors under Chapter 9 of the US bankruptcy code, which would allow the city to reorganise its debts. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers have shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. It is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to £100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at £100 and the maximum payout at £500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <description>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England.</description>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <body>Ebay has announced it is to acquire start-up Shutl in a bid to bring one-hour delivery to the UK. The service will be offered when both seller and buyer are in the same area. The online auction site already has a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes, with Shutl, to add more than 20 other US cities next year. The UK service will start in London. Speedy delivery is seen as a key growth area for retailers, with rivals such as Amazon also rolling out new services. Its AmazonFresh offering, which is so far only available in Los Angeles or Seattle, sources products from grocery shops, restaurants and other local businesses - essentially acting as a enhanced courier service. Other start-ups such as San Francisco-based Instacart promise the same, although its approach is not to have any direct tie-up with retailers. "Today, approximately 75% of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home," said eBaymarketplaces president Devin Wenig in a statement announcing the Shutl acquisition. "Traditional retail isn't going away. But it is transforming, and that creates enormous opportunity within the $10 trillion total commerce market." No financial details of the deal were disclosed by either company. Shutl already operates in the UK, counting retailers such as Schuh, Warehouse and Argos among its clients. It allows customers to choose as-soon-as-possible delivery - its record is just under 14 minutes - or to select a one-hour window in which to receive the goods. Using rapid delivery comes at a cost - Shutl adds an extra £6.99 to some products if they are needed quickly. Founder and chief executive Tom Allason said that Shutl would continue to work with all its existing partners, but would expand to accommodate eBay's plans. "E-commerce is quick and convenient, two things that delivery is not," wrote Mr Allason. "Together with eBay, we believe that we can transform this market and fulfil our mission." </body>

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads.

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645809_c0109978-emerald_ash_borer_on_a_leaf-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Many might want to do something about urban foxes in their area. There's an increasingly popular and humane way to outwit them.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>
      <date>1382403985</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637618_grass.ts.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace after less than a year in charge. It is unclear whether the 50-year-old resigned, was sacked, or left by mutual consent but the Premier League club are holding a news conference at 17:30 BST. Holloway guided Palace to promotion via the play-offs last season after joining in November 2012, and has won only one league game and lost seven this season. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. Speculation surrounded Holloway's job following a meeting with chairman Steve Parish after the loss to Fulham, with the pair believed to have held further talks on Tuesday. The former Blackpool manager said he spent a long time with his players immediately after the defeat. Speaking before the game at Selhurst Park, Parish had told BBC Radio 5 live that Holloway's position was secure. More to follow. </body>

      <title>Robshaw to captain England in autumn</title>
      <description>Chris Robshaw will captain England in their forthcoming autumn Test series after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood.</description>

      <body>Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will resume the England captaincy in their forthcoming autumn Tests after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood. Robshaw, 27, first led England against Scotland in February 2012 and continued in the role for 16 Tests. But having missed out on a British and Irish Lions place, he was rested for this summer's Argentina tour, when fellow back-rower Wood took over. But head coach Stuart Lancaster has decided to stick with Robshaw. The decision means he is likely to remain at open-side flanker for the matches against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand. "The first and foremost criteria for captaincy is to be on the team sheet and Chris is in there on his playing ability," Lancaster said. "But on top of that he has a massive amount of respect within the squad and has led England well. Every team needs leaders; we are building a strong group and Chris is at the forefront of that leadership." A year ago both Lancaster and Robshaw enjoyed their finest hour in the shock victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham. The uncertain form of his club side Harlequins has meant Robshaw has endured a difficult start to the season. But with his main rival for the number seven shirt, Gloucester's Matt Kvesic, also playing in a struggling side, he has won the battle for both his place and leadership role. "Every time you pull on that white shirt it's a privilege," Robshaw said. "It's a huge honour to be named captain and to lead your country. But I've always said it's not about who you are but what you do and I've got to make sure that I perform as a player first. "We have some good leaders across the squad and I know we will support each other as we head into a massive game against Australia." With Lancaster expected to give Saracens' Billy Vunipola a first start at number eight against Australia on 2 November, the likely inclusion of Wood and Robshaw in the other two back-row positions gives England significant experience for the southern hemisphere tests ahead. Lancaster is "pretty optimistic" that Wood's Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley will be fit to face the Wallabies next week despite the hooker having his foot in a plastic boot after turning his ankle over playing for Saints in their Heineken Cup win over Ospreys on Sunday. Bath prop David Wilson has also also yet to train with the squad at their Leeds base this week and is receiving ongoing treatment for a tight calf. Gloucester's uncapped centre Henry Trinder, a contender to make his debut against Australia, is "progressing well" with a hamstring strain and could return to training on Thursday. But prop Alex Corbisiero remains a doubt for the Wallabies Test as he continues with "off-field" rehabilitation from a knee injury. </body>

      <title>I have been treated unfairly - Hock</title>
      <description>Gareth Hock believes his breach of discipline was not serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad.</description>

      <body>Gareth Hock has told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. Hock overslept the next morning, missing a recovery session, and was informed of his dismissal in a phone conversation with coach Steve McNamara. "For missing a 10-minute swim - I think it's out of order really," said Hock. "I agree that it was wrong and we shouldn't have had a drink, but there were six or seven of us and we all did the same thing," he told BBC North West Tonight. England have said they will make no further comment about Hock's removal. Huddersfield's Brett Ferres has been added to the squad in his place. In a statement released late on Tuesday evening, they confirmed the Salford-bound second-rower had been taken out of the 24-man party "as a result of serious breaches of team discipline that have fallen below the strict code of conduct as agreed by team management". Hock's career has been littered with controversy, including a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2009, and he admitted he can understand why people may jump to conclusions about the nature of his indiscretion. He continued: "People are thinking the worst because of the way it's been handled. I know what people will be thinking, and that's up to them. It's come out wrong and people are thinking the worst. "That's the only thing that's happened and I only did the same as what the other lads did, apart from sleeping in for half an hour." An alcohol ban had been imposed on the England squad until after their World Cup opener against pre-tournament favourites Australia in Cardiff on 26 October. But Hock said the ban was broken after they lost their final warm-up match 15-14 to the unfancied Italians in Salford. The former Wigan Warriors man, who has won eight England caps, added: "A few of the boys went out for a few drinks and then went out for a bite to eat. We came back and I overslept. I missed a 10-minute swim and a 10-minute medical check-up. "We were told that there was no drinking until after the Australia game, but we were disappointed about the loss and a few of us had a few drinks. "We got a phone call from Steve to say he'd found out we'd been out, and he would be ringing us back with his decision. He rang me back and said he was going to be taking me out of the squad." Hock, who was unhappy not to be told the news face-to-face, continued: "I blew up a bit and he said the others would be getting disciplined as well, but then afterwards I found out that there was only me being taken out of the squad. I was gutted. I thought it was a bit harsh and I just needed a warning like they did. "I've worked really hard for this and the people in the camp will tell you that. It's embarrassing. "All I can say is 'sorry' again for what I did do, but it's nothing bad compared to what people are thinking."

      <title>Tour's UK start a privilege - Froome</title>
      <description>The 2014 Tour de France, which begins in Yorkshire, will include five mountain finishes and only one individual time-trial.</description>

      <body>Chris Froome said he is pleased to be starting the defence of his Tour de France title in Britain, on the day the 2014 route was revealed. The Team Sky rider, 28, became the second Briton in a row to win the crown after Bradley Wiggins's 2012 victory. Froome said having the race begin in Leeds "feels like a real privilege". The 101st Tour  will include five mountain finishes, one individual time-trial and nine cobbled sections on stage five in northern France. It will start in the Yorkshire city on 5 July, one of two stages in the county, before the riders race from Cambridge to London prior to the French stages. "I was bowled over at the support we had in France so I can only imagine what it is going to be like over in Yorkshire," Froome added. "It is going to be massive. It certainly gives a little bit of added pressure too I'm sure." Meanwhile, the Briton said the cobbles in northern France would be "a bit of a risk" for the riders, but provide for an intriguing race. "The cobblestones are going to make it interesting, that's for sure, and they are going to make a good addition to the race," he added on the Team Sky website. "For us as riders, it's a bit of a risk - there are accidents and mechanical problems that could happen - but it will make the race exciting and begin sort the race out at an early stage." Tour director Christian Prudhomme said: "Uncertainty is part of the competition. It would not make sense to avoid the cobbles when we go through northern France." Froome added that he was happy to see the reappearance of a summit finish on La Planches des Belles Filles on stage 10 - the first of five major summit finishes. "It was a very special day for me winning at La Planches des Belles Filles in 2012," he said, with eventual champion Wiggins taking yellow for the first time in that edition. "I'll get a special feeling going back there again next year. It's going to be the first summit finish again - which it was last time - and I think that always marks quite an important day for the general classification riders." It will be the fourth time the race has visited the UK and the first time since 2007, when a Westminster prologue was followed by a stage through Kent. Previous visits came in 1974 and 1994. The opening stage to Harrogate is expected to end in a sprint, giving Mark Cavendish - who has 25 stage wins in the Tour - the chance to take the race leader's yellow jersey in his mother's home town. "I'm super excited about the first stage coming to Harrogate," said the 28-year-old. "I still have a lot of family there and it gives me an opportunity to wear the yellow jersey in front of my fans, so to dream of that is a big thing." The second, hilly stage is from York to Sheffield and could open up gaps in the general classification standings, before another stage expected to end in a sprint, from Cambridge to The Mall in central London. Welcome To Yorkshire chief executive Gary Verity said he expected more than a million people to attend the stages in Yorkshire. "I would think that would be the minimum - probably closer to two million, that will depend on the weather," he said. "People will realise it is a once-in-a-generation thing and they will turn out in big numbers." Soon after it leaves Britain, the race will arrive in Ypres, to commemorate the 100th year since the start of World War One. The Tour will then head to some unfamiliar climbs in eastern France before heading down to the Alps and across to the Pyrenees before the penultimate stage - a 54km individual time trial between Bergerac to Perigueux, which could decide the winner of the Tour. The 21st and final stage will finish, as per usual, at the Champs-Elysees in Paris.

      <title>Sheff Utd name Clough as manager</title>
      <description>Sheffield United appoint former Derby County boss Nigel Clough as their new manager to replace David Weir.</description>

      <body>Sheffield United have appointed former Derby County boss Nigel Clough as their new manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 47-year-old, who was sacked by the Rams in September, replaces David Weir at Bramall Lane. Weir was dismissed earlier this month after winning just one of his 10 league matches in charge of the Blades. Clough's first game in charge of the struggling League One side is Saturday's home match against Crewe. Sheffield United co-chairman Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud told the club website:  "Nigel was the clear, first choice of the board. He brings an approach to the game that is well suited to what we are trying to achieve at Sheffield United. "Nigel has enjoyed managerial success in the game. He knows how to inspire first team players to give their all and has a proven track record of making an academy a key ingredient to the club's success. "We count ourselves lucky to have Nigel aboard." Former England international forward Clough started his managerial career with Burton Albion in 1998 after a successful playing career that took in stints with Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Manchester City. Having guided the Brewers to the top of the Conference Premier, he left to take over Derby in January 2009, following in the footsteps of his late father Brian, who managed the club to the league title in the 1970s. He was charged with cutting the wage bill and rebuilding the club after a disastrous one-season spell in the Premier League in 2007-08, where they had finished with a record low 11 points. In his four full seasons in charge of the East Midlands side he failed to take the club into the Championship play-offs but did nurture young talent including Will Hughes and Mason Bennett. Clough will become the fourth person to attempt to lead Sheffield United out of the third tier. Danny Wilson took them to the play-off final in his only full season before being replaced by Chris Morgan on a caretaker basis for the run-in last season. The Blades were beaten in the play-off semi-final by Yeovil and Weir was appointed on a three-year deal in June. After winning his first league game, the Scot was to pick up just two more points from his following nine league games and was sacked following a 1-0 Johnstone's Paint Trophy defeat by Hartlepool. Morgan again stepped into the breach and took four points from his three games in charge to stop the slide but Clough must now set about helping the club make up the 13-point gap on the top six. Clough brings former Derby coaches Gary Crosby and Andy Garner with him, while ex-skipper Morgan is being kept on. </body>

      <body>A woman has been killed in a fall of about 80ft (24m) from the third floor of a clothes store in Liverpool. Merseyside Police said she was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor of Primark in Church Street, at 18:00 BST on Tuesday. The 57-year-old woman had been seen moments before at a balcony next to the third-floor escalators. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. The coroner has been informed. She was treated by a doctor at the scene but was pronounced dead later at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. An North West Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the drop from the third-floor escalators was about 80ft. Liverpool City Council, which has health and safety responsibilities for the city's shops, said it was waiting for the results of police inquiries before deciding whether to investigate. Primark has not been available for comment. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later. Five years ago, at the same store, a three-year-old girl fell through a gap between the escalators to the lower ground floor while travelling up to the third floor with her family. She broke her left leg and arm and suffered internal injuries but survived. </body>

      <body>An MP has helped rescue a woman from the River Thames after seeing what he thought was a dead body float past him. Stephen Gilbert, MP for St Austell and Newquay, was at an event at the House of Commons terrace, overlooking the Thames, on Tuesday night. The Liberal Democrat said: "What looked like a body just floated past. Then I saw that the person then moved and I followed them down the terrace." He threw a lifebelt which the woman caught before being pulled out. The RNLI and Marine Police rescued her from the water near Westminster Pier. Mr Gilbert said: "There are some lifebuoys on the terrace, I guess this is not the first time something like this has happened." He added the shock had left him "barely able to string a sentence together". After the rescue he tweeted: "Shaken after seeing a body float past House of Commons terrace - she moved, I threw a life-buoy and she's now been rescued! #Result." The woman was taken to hospital. </body>

      <body>A number of people have been arrested in Scotland under the Terrorism Act during an operation focused on dissident Irish Republicans. Police Scotland said they were arrested at several locations under section 41 of the Act "on suspicion of committing various offences". It is believed that those who were arrested are being held at Glasgow's high-security Govan Police Station. The Security Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland were involved. A statement about the operation from Police Scotland Asst Ch Con Ruaraidh Nicolson said: "It focused on the activities of individuals sympathetic to dissident Republicanism but who are not affiliated to any specific group. "Police Scotland has led the operation which has involved a number of officers, including specialist units, and public safety has been a priority throughout. "We are confident as a result of these arrests there is no risk to the public. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage." </body>

      <body>Calls for a ban on items of a sexual nature in Edinburgh's licensed saunas have been withdrawn. Police Scotland had written to councillors asking that licences should only be granted on the condition such items were not allowed on the premises. Safe sex campaigners were angered by the move, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. However, the condition was withdrawn from the council committee without any discussion. And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. Councillors granted new licenses to five of 13 city saunas. They are due to decide in private later whether the remaining eight saunas are also to be granted new licenses. Earlier this year, six other saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". </body>

      <body>A viable pipe bomb has been found during a security alert in Londonderry that left a number of people out of their homes on Wednesday morning. The device was thrown at a police vehicle on Charlotte Street, in the Bogside area, on Tuesday night. Charlotte Street has reopened as have Barrack Street and the Lecky flyover. "Someone could have died. I would be very surprised if this wasn't down to one of the dissident groups here," Chief Inspector Jon Burrows said. "Do they want to create headlines of murder and destruction? What they are portraying is anti-Derry." SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey said the alert had caused "major disruption". Army bomb experts were called but have since left the scene. "I understand an object was thrown at a PSNI Land Rover. Police then cordoned off the area until Army technical officers arrived," Mr Ramsey said. "This is utterly unacceptable and there are older people living in the area close-by who do not need this kind of disruption." </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have attended a service to remember nine people murdered in the Shankill bomb. A service to mark the 20th anniversary of the bombing took place in West Kirk Presbyterian Church. The DUP MP Willie McCrea has raised the anniversary of the bombing at Westminster. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, the South Antrim MP said that "no-one should equate victims with murderers". In response the prime minister said "no-one should glorify terrorism". He urged people in Northern Ireland to "come together for a shared future". During the service shops on the Shankill Road pulled down their shutters as a mark of respect and part of the road has been closed. Hundreds of people stood outside the church to hear the special memorial service. Pupils from the Harmony Primary School and the Girls Model laid flowers at a nearby memorial and at the actual bomb site further up the road. This coincided with the time the bomb went off exactly 20 years ago. Nine Protestant civilians were killed in the 1993 attack in Belfast, as well as one of the IRA bombers - Thomas Begley. Among the dead were two children aged seven and 13. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in October in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. </body>

      <description>French travellers begin to leave a hospital car park where they took over spaces reserved for medical staff.</description>

      <body>French travellers are leaving a hospital car park they have occupied since Saturday, blocking spaces reserved for medical staff. The travellers were warned to move from the Royal Gwent in Newport by Tuesday or face legal action. However, some of the 13 caravans remained - and it was only at about 16:00 BST on Wednesday that a procession of vehicles began leaving. One traveller told BBC Wales they had been waiting for a car to be fixed. The travellers, who said they were attending a funeral, arrived at the 300-space car park on Saturday, taking up 65 spaces. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away from the car park on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After the 16:00 BST deadline passed on Tuesday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, confirmed it would take legal action. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm [on Tuesday]," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. One of the travellers, Ringo Gogan, told the BBC they planned to leave for France at 17:00 BST once one of their cars had been repaired. He said they had come to Wales for a funeral and told police they were staying for a couple of days. </body>

      <body>An 81-year-old church minister has been arrested in south west Wales over an allegation of historical child abuse. Gwyn Ieuan Morgan from Johnstown, Carmarthen, has been suspended from duties at his two chapels pending the outcome of a police investigation. Dr Geraint Tudur, general secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, said members were "naturally traumatised". Dyfed Powys Police said the minister had been bailed while inquiries continue. Mr Morgan has served Bryn Iwan Chapel, near Cynwyl Elfed, and Moreia Chapel in Blaenwaun, north of St Clears, since 1972. Dr Tudur said: "As a charity which offers our members legal and pastoral support, we advised the churches involved to suspend their minister at once, pending the outcome of the investigation. "This advice was immediately acted upon by church trustees. "The church members are naturally traumatised by this development and the union is giving them continuing pastoral support." A statement from the group added: "The union has no power to enforce CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks and registration, although it regularly and strongly urges local churches to ensure that the procedure is followed." Dyfed Powys Police confirmed that "an 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with an historic allegation of sexual activity with a minor". "He remains on bail while inquiries continue," the force added. </body>

      <body>At least seven police have been killed in Tunisia in clashes with Islamist militants, reports say. A heavy exchange of gunfire was reported in the central region of Sidi Bouzid and at least two militants were also reported killed. The fighting came as thousands of Tunisians marched in the capital, calling for the resignation of the Islamist-led government. Prime Minster Ali Larayedh is expected to announce his intention to resign. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Mozambique warned of conflict risk</title>
      <description>Zimbabwean officials say they will not accept a return to conflict in neighbouring Mozambique, days after ex-rebels withdraw from a 1992 peace accord.</description>

      <body>Zimbabwe has urged rebels in Mozambique not to fight, after an opposition group with military and political wings withdrew from a 1992 peace deal. Zimbabwe's Deputy Foreign Minister Christopher Mutsvangwa told the BBC that he would not countenance a return to civil war in Mozambique. The Renamo movement, thought to have about 1,000 fighters as well as 51 MPs, ended the peace accord on Monday. Mozambique's 1976-1992 civil war led to about a million deaths. Mr Mutsvangwa said Renamo should rejoin the political process, not threaten regional stability. He told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama should "never, never" return to violence. "Southern Africa will not countenance this. We simply do not need this in this region at this juncture," he said. He added that regional body Sadc (Southern African Development Community) would consider sending troops to help the government if the security situation deteriorated. "It will be misguided for Renamo to bring instability and expect Zimbabwe to watch," he said. Renamo pulled out of the peace accord after government forces captured Mr Dhlakama's base in the Gorongosa mountains in central Mozambique on Monday, forcing him to flee. Rebel fighters retaliated by opening fire on a police station in the town of Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from the base, state-run Radio Mozambique reported. The US has urged the two sides to "move back from the brink". "We are encouraging the two parties to take visible and decisive steps to de-escalate the current tense environment," said US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf. Mozambique's economy has been booming in recent years, with the discovery of a major offshore gas field in 2011. Mozambican mediator Lourenco do Rosario said he had held talks with Renamo to ease tension. He said Renamo leaders had told him they did not want to return to war. Renamo MPs attended a parliamentary session on Wednesday, despite pulling out of the peace accord. "We are continuing our work as usual," senior Renamo MP Vicente Ululu told the BBC. Renamo's 51 MPs make it the largest opposition party. Mozambique's President Armando Guebuza, who is touring the central region, called on Mr Dhlakama to resume dialogue with the government. Mr Ululu said he did not believe the president was serious about talks. Renamo was supported by South Africa's former white-minority regime during the civil war that raged after Mozambique's independence in 1975. After Robert Mugabe came to power in Zimbabwe, he backed Mozambique's Frelimo government. Renamo has contested elections since the end of the civil war, but has failed to dislodge Frelimo from power Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Renamo has complained that the Frelimo government is determined to hold on to power and has failed to create conditions for free and fair elections. Frelimo denies the allegations and says Renamo does not have support among voters. </body>

      <title>China paper in journalist plea</title>
      <description>A Chinese newspaper publishes a full-page appeal for the release of one of its journalists detained by police.</description>

      <body>A Chinese newspaper has published a rare front-page plea for the release of one of its journalists held by police. The New Express, based in Guangzhou, called for Chen Yongzhou, who was detained last week, to be freed. The paper said Mr Chen's detention was linked to reports he wrote about a part state-owned construction equipment company based in Hunan. Police in Hunan have confirmed the journalist has been detained for "damage to business reputation''. Earlier this year, Mr Chen wrote several reports about Zoomlion, which is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government. Zoomlion issued a statement after one New Express article, which alleged it had improperly accounted for sales, caused its share price to drop. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange in late May, the company called the claims "false, groundless and misleading". The New Express led its article with a large three-character headline that read "Please Release Him". It said it had remained quiet so far because it feared Mr Chen, who was detained on 19 October, might be mistreated. "We always thought that as long as we report responsibly then there would be no problem; and even in the event of a problem, we can publish corrections and apologise; if it is really serious, and we lose a court case, we will pay or shut down if we have to," the editorial said. "But the fact is, we are too naive. Chen Yongzhou had spent three days and three nights [in custody] before he saw a lawyer," it added. Like all Chinese newspapers, the New Express comes under strict state control, but it has nonetheless gained a reputation for investigative journalism, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai. "We are a small newspaper, but we have the backbone no matter how poor we are," the paper said in its piece. Recent years have seen sporadic clashes between Chinese media outlets and the authorities. In January, journalists at the Guangdong-based Southern Weekly newspaper called for a propaganda chief to quit, after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute. The row sparked small protests and displays of solidarity from other media outlets before the issue was resolved. There have been strong reactions to the news of Chen Yongzhou's detention from users of weibo, China's version of Twitter. Around 30 lawyers have put forward their names to rally support for Mr Chen and organised a virtual body - "Observation Group on the Detention of New Express Reporter Chen Yongzhou". But the group have not said what they plan to do. Media professionals, including journalists, are also using weibo to join the call for police to release Mr Chen. An editor from Dongfang Jinbao, a Henan-based newspaper, wrote: "Support New Express to safeguard the rights of its journalists. The bottom line of consensus in today's society is rule of law. Why did the police arrest Mr Chen? On what legal basis? Is it detention or arrest?" Weibo users have also commented on the censorship of the news of Mr Chen's detention. Another journalist from Henan province added: Within 10 minutes, all major internet portals like Sina, Sohu, Tencent and others have withdrawn the story from their home pages. This is a moment of shame for all (except a few) journalists in China. Other users, however, are urging restraint, saying that it is not good to jump to any conclusions now. The appeal by the New Express comes as the administration led by President Xi Jinping takes a tough approach to press and internet freedom. China's 250,000 journalists and reporters are currently undertaking compulsory on-the-job training. Critics say its apparent aim is to make sure that journalists toe the party line. Some internet bloggers with large numbers of followers on weibo have been arrested for allegedly "spreading rumours". Other high-profile bloggers have stopped posting comments on sensitive issues, apparently fearing reprisals by the government. Rights group Reporters Without Borders has added Xi Jinping to a list of 39 leaders and groups identified as Predators of Freedom of Information in 2013. </body>

      <title>Australia fire threat 'averted'</title>
      <description>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney has been "averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is not yet over.</description>

      <body>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney "has been averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is far from over. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said residents would be able to return to their homes. But he warned that fresh challenges lay ahead in the coming days amid unfavourable conditions. In total, 73 fires are burning across the state, 29 of which are uncontained. Meanwhile, a fire service investigation has concluded the largest of the fires in the Blue Mountains - State Mine near Lithgow - was caused by explosives training at an army range at Marrangaroo last Wednesday. Mr Fitzsimmons confirmed the cause of the fire was "on a live firing range as a result of the detonation of some ordnance", but he said: "Any suggestion that this practice would be on par with someone deliberately lighting fires, reckless or criminal, is outrageous". The defence department has not yet commented on the findings, but acknowledged at the weekend that it could have been the cause. The findings have angered Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill who said the army "should not have been firing" on such a hot, dry day. Hundreds of homes have already been destroyed as more than 3,000 firefighters battle to contain the bushfires in Australia's most populous state. Fire officials had warned that Wednesday's combination of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds could lead to more devastation. But fire chiefs confirmed by the end of the day that not one home had been lost. "If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today, to be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted," Mr Fitzsimmons said. Fire chiefs say a combination of back-burning - the controlled burning of areas with the aim of depriving a fire of fuel - building lines of containment and strategic planning had paid off. In particular, firefighters on Tuesday merged the State Mine fire with one at Mount Victoria to prevent them linking up with the third. "It is absolutely wonderful it did not run," Mr Fitzsimmons said. But he warned people to remain extremely vigilant. "There are still fires flaring up," he said. "There's every prospect we're going to see some more." Many schools in the Blue Mountains are expected to remain closed on Thursday. A major highway through the region is also closed. Emergency alerts remain in place near the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. An emergency alert in Springwood, to the west, has been downgraded to a watch-and-act alert. Earlier, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres linking bushfires to global warming and criticising his decision to repeal a tax on carbon emissions introduced by the previous government. "The official in question is talking through her hat," Mr Abbott told local media. "Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change - they're just a function of life in Australia." Mr Abbott, who took office in September, has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <body>The international police body Interpol has called on member states to make their national databases of missing people available. The appeal is a further attempt to identify a young blonde girl named Maria, who was found in a Roma camp in Greece last week. A search on Interpol's worldwide database proved unsuccessful. Interpol has also requested that the DNA profile be taken of anyone claiming to be a relative and sent to Interpol. "We took the DNA profile received from the Greek authorities and we compared it to our database. And there was no match," the secretary general of Interpol, Ronald Noble, told AFP news agency. He said he was hopeful that the huge publicity the case had received worldwide might help find some of her relatives. "A DNA profile can be taken by the police anywhere in the world, sent to Interpol and compared to the profile sent to us by the Greek authorities," Mr Noble said. Those countries which do not have national DNA databases are also being encouraged to add all their DNA records of missing children to Interpol's database. On Tuesday the Roma couple, identified by Greek police as Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, were formally charged with abduction and remanded in custody pending their trial. They insist that the girl was given to them legitimately. The case has sparked concern among the parents of missing children around the world. Greek authorities are investigating whether the girl may have been a victim of child trafficking. Criminal organisations bring hundreds of children from the Balkans to Greece, where they are subjected to forced labour, sex-trafficking or sold to couples - in Greece or abroad - in illegal adoption schemes. </body>

      <title>US: French tapping claims 'false'</title>
      <description>US spy chief James Clapper denies reports that the US collected data on 70 million French phone calls in a single month.</description>

      <body>US intelligence chief James Clapper has denied reports that US spies recorded data from 70 million phone calls in France in a single 30-day period. The director of national intelligence said the report in Le Monde newspaper contained "misleading information". In a separate story, the newspaper said the US bugged French diplomats and used the information to sway a key UN vote. Both reports were based on leaks from fugitive ex-US intelligence worker Edward Snowden. "Recent articles published in the French newspaper Le Monde contain inaccurate and misleading information regarding US foreign intelligence activities," Mr Clapper said in a statement released on Tuesday. "The allegation that the National Security Agency collected more than 70 million 'recordings of French citizens' telephone data' is false." Mr Clapper said he would not discuss details of surveillance activities, but acknowledged "the United States gathers intelligence of the type gathered by all nations". His statement did not mention the second set of allegations about the National Security Agency (NSA) programmes that allegedly monitored French diplomats in Washington and at the UN. The paper laid out how US spies used computer bugs and phone-tapping techniques to monitor French diplomats at the UN and in Washington. German magazine Der Spiegel had previously reported the monitoring of French diplomats, and the Washington Post had revealed the existence of a global cyber-spying programme called Genie. But Le Monde's story gives details of how US agents used the intelligence, apparently gathered from French diplomats under the Genie programme. It quotes a document issued by a directorate of the NSA as stating that the data helped the US sway a Security Council vote on a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran on 9 June 2010. The US had apparently feared losing the vote, and needed French support. The document quotes America's former UN envoy Susan Rice as saying the NSA's information helped the US "keep one step ahead in the negotiations". On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he had asked for a full explanation of those claims from US Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr Fabius told reporters he had reiterated the view of France that "this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable". However, French officials played down the possibility of any reprisals. Government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said: "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." She was speaking before Le Monde's allegations about the UN vote were published. Information leaked by former NSA worker Edward Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden, who went public with his allegations in June, is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Chile widows sue Communist leader</title>
      <description>Soldiers' widows take legal action against Chile's Communist leader, who said his party approved a 1986 attack on General Pinochet, in which their husbands died.</description>

      <body>The widows of three Chilean soldiers have launched legal action against the country's Communist Party leader. The Communists' president, Guillermo Teillier admitted his party approved an armed operation targeting the late General Augusto Pinochet in 1986. Five troops escorting the leader died and 11 were injured in the ambush. Around 3,000 people disappeared or died in Chile between 1973 and 1990 and 30,000 are believed to have been tortured by the authorities. In an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in April, Mr Teillier said his party had approved the failed attempt against Gen Pinochet's life and other armed operations in the 1980s. It was "nothing more than a reaction" to what the government had been doing against the Communist leadership, Mr Teillier said. The women taking legal action say they want him jailed for the deaths. "We want justice and equality before the law, that's all we want," one of the widows told Chilean Radio Bio Bio. The recent 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup headed by Gen Pinochet re-ignited nationwide debate about responsibilities and punishment for crimes committed during the period of military rule. The daughters of an ally of the deposed leader Salvador Allende, former President Michelle Bachelet, and of a Pinochet assistant, Evelyn Matthei, are pitted against each other in next months presidential elections, which has heightened the country's political sensitivity further. </body>

      <title>Police killed in west Iraq attacks</title>
      <description>At least 19 policemen and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <body>A 15-year-old Yemeni girl was burned to death by her father for getting in touch with her fiance before their wedding, police say. The 35-year-old man was arrested after the teenager's death in the remote village of Shabaa, in Taiz province. "The father committed this heinous crime on the pretext that his daughter had been keeping in contact with her fiance," a police statement claimed. Local news websites said he had caught the pair chatting on the telephone. Traditional tribal customs in some parts of Yemen prohibit contact between men and women before marriage. Last year, the UN Human Rights council raised concerns about so-called "honour killings" in the country. Perpetrators were not charged with murder, and faced only a six-month to one-year prison sentence, it found. Accorded a low status in the family and community, many Yemeni women are subjected to various forms of violence, deprivation of education, early and forced marriages, sexual abuse, restrictions over freedom of movement, forced pregnancy, and female genital mutilation. Last month, there was an outcry after an eight-year-old girl reportedly died of internal bleeding on the night she wed a 40-year-old man. </body>

      <title>Pakistan PM and Obama to talk drones</title>
      <description>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is to meet President Barack Obama to press for an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new relationship.</description>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is due to meet President Barack Obama in the White House seeking an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new post-Afghanistan war relationship. But correspondents say that few breakthroughs are expected on contentious issues on their agenda. The US is unlikely to offer any assurances on its secretive and controversial drone programme. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived two years ago. In May 2011 al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by US special forces at his his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without the Pakistani government receiving prior warning from Washington. Relations were further strained by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. "We want to find ways for our countries to co-operate, even as we have differences on some issues, and we want to make sure that the trajectory of this relationship is a positive one,'' White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Mr Sharif said on Tuesday that drone strikes had "deeply disturbed and agitated" Pakistani people and that his government was committed to bringing them to an end. "The use of drones is not only a violation of our territorial integrity but they are also detrimental to our efforts to eliminate terrorism from our country," he said. The prime minister said that the issue had become "a major irritant" in relations with the US. BBC Pakistan correspondent Shahzeb Jillani says that Mr Sharif is seen as adopting a populist stance largely meant for domestic consumption. Washington is unlikely to agree to any curtailment on its secretive and controversial drones programme, our correspondent says. Instead, President Obama will be more interested to hear from Mr Sharif the role Pakistan could play to ease his troubles in Afghanistan as the US prepares to pull out troops next year. Mr Sharif is expected to assure President Obama that his government is keen to ease regional tensions and live in peace with its neighbours, Afghanistan and India. He will be looking for Washington's help in reviving Pakistan's struggling economy and its growing energy crisis. In the end the two sides will meet with their own wish-lists, our correspondent says, but having experienced a low point two years ago this will also be a meeting about having realistic expectations from a complicated relationship. </body>

      <body>A judge has sentenced an Ohio man who confessed in an online video to a fatal drink-driving crash to six years in prison. Matthew Cordle, 22, had faced up to eight years for the crash that killed Navy veteran Vincent Canzani in June. In a video posted to YouTube in September, he confessed to the crime and promised to plead guilty. Franklin County Judge David Fais revoked Cordle's driving privileges for life as required by state law. In Wednesday's sentencing, the judge read a letter from Vincent Canzani's ex-wife, who said she believed her former husband would not have wanted a maximum sentence. She said she believes Cordle's promise never to drink and drive again. Cordle's father, Dave Cordle, did not ask for leniency as he told the judge he was "disappointed, disgusted and heartbroken" at his son's actions on the night of the crash. In the video, Cordle said he was confessing and accepting responsibility in order to discourage others from drinking and driving. "I'm begging you," he said towards the end of the three-and-a-half minute video, "please don't drink and drive. Don't make the same excuses that I did". </body>

      <title>How do people avoid picking a terrible housemate?</title>
      <description>How do people avoid picking a terrible flatmate?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24622858</url>
      <date>1382524267</date>

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <description>How dangerous is Britain's most venomous spider?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24636116</url>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>What does the future hold for the roller coaster industry?</description>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Afghan Sandhurst opens its doors</title>
      <description>Term begins at new Afghan officer academy</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24629331</url>

      <body>The first cadets for the new Afghan National Army officer academy could not all arrive on the same day, because travel from the country's outlying provinces can be hazardous. But as term begins, more than 200 of the expected 270 new recruits in the first intake are in place. Dubbed Sandhurst in the Sand - and modelled on its namesake institution in the UK - the academy will be Britain's only military presence in the country once combat troops have left next year. It aims to take raw but enthusiastic candidates and turn them into the military leaders of the future, able to lead the growing ranks of ordinary Afghan soldiers. The recruits have come from all over the country, and from a wide range of backgrounds. One group queuing up to receive their uniforms, basic sports kit and toiletries included a teacher, a tailor and several recent university graduates. They said they had joined up to defend their country - and they know the scale of the challenge ahead when international troops pull out. More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers were killed last year, with 3,000 seriously injured. The former tailor, Mohammed Navid, from the north of the country, said: "After 2014 all of the American forces will have gone from my province. We have to achieve our security." The ex-teacher, Sadek, said he wanted to serve his country, but was frank about needing a job. A makeshift army camp in tents is housing the first students, as the academy buildings will not be completed for another year. But "it doesn't matter if we are in tents or in a palace", according to Lt Col Graham Hyland, who is leading a team of mentors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "The key thing is getting started, and getting young warrior leaders that the Afghan National Army wants out on to the field." A visit to the camp barber was the first necessity for the recruits, where a close "number one" cut was the only style on offer. Then they were put into small units - "tolay" in Afghan army jargon. Part of the Sandhurst method is that each tolay should be led by a regular army sergeant, and much of the instruction is by sergeants and other non-commissioned officers, or NCOs. Culturally, it might have been problematic to expect officers to be ordered around by a sergeant, but those running the course hope that once the system is accepted, this will improve relationships in the Afghan army beyond the officers, boosting leadership skills throughout. Col Hyland said it had been a challenge at first when the instructors were being trained, but the substance of the course was what mattered. "They're instructing them in all of the tasks we would have the senior NCOs at Sandhurst doing - in drill, skill at arms, map reading, and fieldcraft." The academy is set in a long, low ridge of hills close to Kabul, with plenty of open ground to learn tactics. And the course has been altered significantly to make it Afghan-specific. The military history syllabus includes the analysis of Afghan tactics in past wars against the British, as well as during the mujahideen wars against the Soviet army. There were 10,000 applicants and they were examined anonymously, so theoretically it should not be possible for influential families to secure a place. Without any artificial quotas, those accepted broadly reflect the tribal divisions of the country. This will be far harder to do when the women's course begins next year, as almost all of the female candidates have been from the Hazara ethnic group - the third largest in the country. The overall British commander, Brig Gen Maurice Sheen, said it was important to forge an Afghan national identity in the academy, and not focus on tribal and ethnic backgrounds. He said the country had a warrior tradition, but recruits needed to be taught to be tactically aware. There is a view among international advisers to the Afghan National Army that casualties within its ranks are higher than they need to be, and better leadership in the field would reduce them. Gen Sheen said the students were willing to learn: "They'll sit for a long long time - quite deferential - which can be a problem at times because we have to encourage them to ask more questions. "They have a longer concentration span than we have and seem like sponges. They are open to whatever we are telling them." This first intake will emerge fully qualified as officers next September, and there will be two more groups joining during the year. For those who have been working over the past year to deliver the course, like Col Hyland, watching the new recruits arrive was a good moment. "I couldn't help but grin the whole day," he said. "It was really delightful to see them, cutting around and doing stuff, getting their kit issued, all those sorts of things. "All those vague memories I have got of Sandhurst, and now here we are at the officer's academy at Qargha - it was really good. I was really proud." </body>

      <title>10 ways christening has changed</title>
      <description>... and 9 other ways christenings have changed since 1982</description>

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <description>The Chinese boss who had a novel approach to quality control</description>

      <body>I will never forget my first encounter with the Chinese business leader Zhang Ruimin almost 10 years ago. There, in a glass case in the boardroom of his company Haier was a sledgehammer, not something you normally encounter in corporate surroundings. But Mr Zhang is no ordinary chief executive, as I was reminded in another meeting a month or two ago in his now rather more elaborate headquarters in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The sledgehammer has been removed to the new corporate museum, something that Chinese businesses are very keen on. But though the story has been frequently told, it is still a good way to explain the remarkable company Zhang Ruimin has created over the past 28 years. The Qingdao Refrigerator Plant was close to failure when Mr Zhang was sent in at the end of 1984. Production at the time was at a low ebb, and there was no money to pay the staff. Mr Zhang borrowed some cash from a countryside workers' co-operative, and set about seeing what could be done about the disastrous state of the company his municipal employers had sent him into. Early notices (now on display in the company museum) banned urination and defecation in the factory. Pretty soon Mr Zhang was confronted with complaints from fridge buyers. In response, he gathered the workers in a yard outside the plant, and in front of them 76 substandard fridges were smashed to pieces. A quality quest to revive the plant started from that symbolic sledgehammer attack. And it worked. Qingdao has historic links with Germany; the city's Tsingtao beer - originally brewed by German expats - is now sold all over the world. So echoing its German partner Leibherr, the fridge business adopted a new name - Haier. Then began a remarkable expansion which has turned it into one of the few current Chinese global brands. With 80,000 employees across the globe, it is now one of the biggest manufacturers of white goods in the world. And when you listen to Zhang Ruimin talking about what he has done, you begin to realise that this is not just a dramatic story about a sledgehammer approach to corporate quality. Using a canny blend of Western management thinking and ancient Eastern ideas, Mr Zhang has created a management philosophy which is deep-seated and far-seeing. At first sight, it might seem to be management jargon plus Confucius, Taoism and Sun Tzu's Art of War all jumbled up. But Mr Zhang has developed some potent insights of his own into how a company might evolve in the face of huge new global challenges. And he is still developing them. "I believe in getting the best of both worlds, both from Chinese culture and from the West," says Mr Zhang. "The good thing about Chinese culture is that it treats something as a whole system, the forest not just the trees. You can see this in the difference of approach of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. "Western medicine treats symptoms; traditional Chinese medicine treats the whole body, holistically. Western culture wants everything quantified... so we have also adopted some Western management concepts." "Last week, I was talking to a marketing guru in the US and he told me, 'Good companies meet demands, great companies create demands.' We want to be a great company." Zhang Ruimin set out for me the evolution of his management ideas. "In the 1980s we mostly learned from Japanese companies," he says. "In the 1990s, we learned from American companies: General Electric's Six Sigma insistence on quality, for example. "But now we have incorporated many of those best practices into building our own innovative business model. It's called the win-win model, aligning employee goals with user needs." So (for example) Haier is trying to use the internet to put customers in touch with the people who make the goods, and workers in touch with the product-people who design them. But doing this is hard work. "We're still in a trial and error period and we're still exploring new models," says Mr Zhang. "In the past we had examples to follow but now we are in uncharted territory." Zhang Ruimin calls this "management without leaders". Workers are supposed to be led by the consumers of the things they make. He adds: "The most difficult thing is that in the past the employees would listen to their bosses, but now they don't have any bosses they have to listen to the users." To make this practical, Haier has broken down its 80,000 workforce into hundreds of internal micro companies, each with a profit and loss account even when they are only supplying internal corporate customers. Employees with a good idea are encouraged to find a team to develop it and get it made. Another striking Haier innovation is "catfish management". In fact it's an acknowledgement that there are still leaders even in a so-called leaderless organisation. They may be a bit paranoid, though. It's explained like this: in the sea, a lone catfish creates a commotion when it swims near a school of other fish. Live salmon are transported to market with a catfish in the tank, to keep them active and lively. Haier gives each of its many division bosses a "catfish" shadow manager, who is poised to take over if the man or woman in charge falters. Three months of missed targets, and the catfish deposes the leaders he or she has been shadowing. Sounds ruthless, but the manager (of air conditioners) who I heard from thought it reasonable and even stimulating. Not sure whether Mr Zhang has a catfish, though. When Zhang Ruimin was busy creating waves at Haier in the 1980s and '90s, the great Chinese industrial revolution was changing the whole global landscape. The country was becoming the industrial production house for the world. But most new Chinese companies were making things ordered, devised and designed by Western companies. They made what other people wanted from them. Haier wanted to export its own goods itself... quite a different philosophy, though fridges and washing machines were not exactly state of the art technology. Something else stands out about Haier's export strategy: the company started off in the developed, tough Western markets - Germany, the USA. Mr Zhang says: "Most Chinese companies would choose the other way, the easy markets first and then the more difficult ones later. Many of them started with Africa and South East Asia because those markets had lower expectations of quality. "But we decided to enter the German market first, and people thought we were crazy. "But we tried an experiment. We said, 'Let's put German products and Haier products together and take out the brand and let people see which one is the worst... we hoped it wasn't us.' "We wanted to set the standards high and thus force us to solve all the problems and to meet those high standards. "The Chinese people say, 'If you want to play chess, you need to play it with the master,' because that's the only way you learn." </body>

      <title>Mac v PC - the battle resumes</title>
      <description>Technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones on a rivalry revived</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Hospices: The forgotten pillar of elderly care?</title>
      <description>Do hospices offer the answer to elderly care?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24626653</url>

      <body>Elderly care is one of the most pressing issues in the NHS. Whether it is the quality of hospital care or the affordability of care homes, ministers are busy trying to improve services. But we have heard very little about hospices. Yet, about a fifth of people - 120,000 a year - get help from them before they die. And compared to hospitals and care homes, they are doing much better at making their final days, weeks and months comfortable. According to the official bereaved families survey produced by the Office for National Statistics, over 80% of people feel hospices treat patients with dignity and respect compared to just over half in hospitals. A similar picture emerges with the administering of pain relief. But is there more that hospices could do? The sector certainly thinks so. It has set up the Commission into the Future of Hospice Care to put forward its case. In a report published this week it says hospices could be playing more of a role - and in turn relieving the pressure on hospitals and AandE units in particular. But to realise the potential the commission wants both hospices themselves and the NHS to raise their game. Hospices, it says, need to innovate. For example, many of the most forward-thinking have started providing much more care in people's homes. Some will have ten times as many people on their books in the community as they will have in their actual hospice building. But to transform themselves they need help. The network of 200-plus hospices in the UK, which receive about a third of their funding from the NHS and two thirds from charitable donations, has largely developed around caring for cancer patients. It means many are not properly equipped to care for the complexities of dementia and multiple illnesses that many of the elderly have these days. To combat this, the commission says it needs the NHS to help with training staff. But it also wants GPs and ambulance crews to engage more with hospices by sending more patients to them instead of hospital when appropriate. Prof Dame Barbara Monroe, vice chair of the Commission into the Future of Hospice Care, believes such measures could have a significant impact. "Modern hospices grew out of a response to appalling deficits in care for people facing the end of life," she says. "Now nearly 50 years on, there are still too many shameful lapses which have dented public confidence in the care system. "Hospices have a unique opportunity to once again lead a new revolution to help transform care." </body>

      <description>The Vatican suspends a German bishop dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over alleged lavish spending, including a $42m renovation of his home.</description>

      <body>The Vatican has suspended a senior German Church leader dubbed the "bishop of bling" by the media over his alleged lavish spending. Bishop of Limburg Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst is accused of spending more than 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on renovating his official residence. The Vatican said it deemed "appropriate... a period of leave from the diocese" for the bishop. The suspension comes two days after he met the Pope to discuss the matter. "A situation has been created in which the bishop can no longer exercise his episcopal duties", a Vatican statement said. It said a Church commission would rule on the matter, but did not say where Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, 53, would go or what he would do while the inquiry was held. The head of Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, Alois Glueck, welcomed the Vatican's decision. He said: "Pope Francis's decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation has become an increasing burden for the faithful there, and in all of Germany, over recent weeks." Bishop Tebartz-van Elst - and his spending habits - had become infamous in Germany, where many people pay Church tax to the state. The tax raised 5.2bn euros for Catholics and 4.6bn euros for Protestants in 2012. Calls were made for the bishop to resign after he was accused of lying under oath about his spending. He was criticised for a first-class flight to India to visit the poor. But his official residence is at the heart of the criticism, after renovations were originally costed at 5.5m euros. German media are reporting that the residence was fitted with a bath that cost 15,000 euros, a conference table for 25,000 euros and a private chapel that cost 2.9m euros. The story has attracted heavy coverage and has stoked controversy among Catholics. It was in Germany that Martin Luther launched the Reformation five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church. The BBC's Alan Johnston, in Rome, says all this was bound to play badly with the new Pope, who has repeatedly expressed his disapproval of senior clerics whose lifestyles seem a little too lavish. Pope Francis has also signalled his intention to clean up the Vatican's finances, appointing a commission to advise him on reforms. There is no surprise in Rome that the Vatican has ordered the bishop's suspension from his duties while the spending row is investigated, our correspondent adds. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is the daughter of a Protestant pastor, said that she had expressed "hope that there will be an answer for believers, for people's confidence in their Church". In his absence, the bishop's diocese will be administered by Limburg's vicar general, Wolfgang Roesch. </body>

      <title>Berlusconi to face bribery trial</title>
      <description>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator in 2006.</description>

      <body>Italian ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial for the alleged bribery of a senator. Berlusconi is accused of paying the left-wing senator 3m euros ($3.9m) to defect to his party in 2006 and help bring down the government. The senator, Sergio De Gregorio, was sentenced to 20 months on Wednesday at a plea bargain hearing in Naples. Berlusconi has been embroiled in a number of trials and says he is the victim of a campaign by the judiciary. He has made no immediate comment on the latest ruling. Also charged in the latest case is Berlusconi's former aide, Valter Lavitola, who is accused of being an intermediary in the alleged bribe. The defection of De Gregorio, a senator from Naples, to Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party weakened the government of Romano Prodi, which collapsed in 2008 and triggered elections that returned Berlusconi to power. De Gregorio said on Wednesday: "I urge Silvio Berlusconi to leave the political scene, which would free Italy from a lot of dirt." He added: "I now believe I behaved in an absolutely reprehensible way and was aiming to bring down the Prodi government as part of a sort of holy war being waged by Berlusconi." Mr Lavitola appeared at the Naples hearing, telling it that "there is no proof that I could have known that it was money for a bribe. I would have been simply a conduit". Mr Lavitola was placed under investigation in 2011. He left for South America shortly afterwards and was arrested on his return in April 2012. Berlusconi's supporters have rallied to his defence. PDL lawmaker Daniele Capezzone told Agence France-Presse: "I think Italians fully understand that what has been happening in the past few years is an attack against a political leader who was freely and democratically chosen by millions." The trial is scheduled to start in February. Berlusconi, 77, has faced a series of court cases in recent years. On Saturday a court in Milan banned him from holding public office for two years, following his conviction in August for tax fraud. The ban has still to be voted on in parliament. A cross-party panel of the Italian Senate has also recommended his expulsion from the chamber, which means he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi is currently appealing against convictions for sex with an underage prostitute, abuse of power and leaking confidential information. Early this month, Berlusconi suffered political humiliation when forced to perform a U-turn in parliament on a confidence vote. Berlusconi had promised to topple the government of PM Enrico Letta by withdrawing his party's support. But he backed down when it became clear that several of his PDL senators would support the government. </body>

      <body>At least seven police have been killed in Tunisia in clashes with Islamist militants, reports say. A heavy exchange of gunfire was reported in the central region of Sidi Bouzid and at least two militants were also reported killed. The fighting came as thousands of Tunisians marched in the capital, calling for the resignation of the Islamist-led government. Prime Minster Ali Larayedh is expected to announce his intention to resign. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Australia fire threat 'averted'</title>
      <description>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney has been "averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is not yet over.</description>

      <body>Australian fire officials say the threat to the Blue Mountains west of Sydney "has been averted" for the day, but warn the crisis is far from over. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said residents would be able to return to their homes. But he warned that fresh challenges lay ahead in the coming days amid unfavourable conditions. In total, 73 fires are burning across the state, 29 of which are uncontained. Meanwhile, a fire service investigation has concluded the largest of the fires in the Blue Mountains - State Mine near Lithgow - was caused by explosives training at an army range at Marrangaroo last Wednesday. Mr Fitzsimmons confirmed the cause of the fire was "on a live firing range as a result of the detonation of some ordnance", but he said: "Any suggestion that this practice would be on par with someone deliberately lighting fires, reckless or criminal, is outrageous". The defence department has not yet commented on the findings, but acknowledged at the weekend that it could have been the cause. The findings have angered Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill who said the army "should not have been firing" on such a hot, dry day. Hundreds of homes have already been destroyed as more than 3,000 firefighters battle to contain the bushfires in Australia's most populous state. Fire officials had warned that Wednesday's combination of high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds could lead to more devastation. But fire chiefs confirmed by the end of the day that not one home had been lost. "If you have been someone that has chosen to depart the Blue Mountains today, to be out of harm's way, then it would be safe to head back home tonight because the risk has been averted," Mr Fitzsimmons said. Fire chiefs say a combination of back-burning - the controlled burning of areas with the aim of depriving a fire of fuel - building lines of containment and strategic planning had paid off. In particular, firefighters on Tuesday merged the State Mine fire with one at Mount Victoria to prevent them linking up with the third. "It is absolutely wonderful it did not run," Mr Fitzsimmons said. But he warned people to remain extremely vigilant. "There are still fires flaring up," he said. "There's every prospect we're going to see some more." Many schools in the Blue Mountains are expected to remain closed on Thursday. A major highway through the region is also closed. Emergency alerts remain in place near the city of Newcastle, north of Sydney. An emergency alert in Springwood, to the west, has been downgraded to a watch-and-act alert. Earlier, new Prime Minister Tony Abbott hit back at comments by UN climate chief Christiana Figueres linking bushfires to global warming and criticising his decision to repeal a tax on carbon emissions introduced by the previous government. "The official in question is talking through her hat," Mr Abbott told local media. "Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it. But these fires are certainly not a function of climate change - they're just a function of life in Australia." Mr Abbott, who took office in September, has drafted legislation to repeal the carbon tax, which imposed a levy on the country's 300 biggest polluters. The new prime minister, who says the tax cost jobs and forced energy prices up, wants to introduce a Direct Action plan under which farmers and industry will be paid to act to reduce emissions.

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>

      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments as to whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments as to whether the city of Detroit should be granted protection from its creditors. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. Union and pension fund representatives will argue against the bankruptcy filing as they want to preserve payments to former city workers. They say that city officials have not properly negotiated with creditors. According to the unions and pension funds, Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, did not hold formal negotiating sessions before filing for bankruptcy. They are also likely to argue that the city is not bankrupt and has assets that can be sold, including pieces from the Detroit Institute of Arts. City managers say they have negotiated in good faith and bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's $18bn in debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. "There are only so many things they can fight about," said John Pottow, a University of Michigan professor who specialises in bankruptcy law. "They can fight about the solvency and they can fight about the negotiating in good faith." Lawyers from both sides will present evidence and call witnesses before the federal bankruptcy judge, Steven Rhodes. He has allotted 10 days for hearings over the next three weeks, although the hearings could take less time than that. He will then decide whether Detroit merits protection from its creditors under Chapter 9 of the US bankruptcy code, which would allow the city to reorganise its debts. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers have shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. It is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <body>A Chinese newspaper has published a rare front-page plea for the release of one of its journalists held by police. The New Express, based in Guangzhou, called for Chen Yongzhou, who was detained last week, to be freed. The paper said Mr Chen's detention was linked to reports he wrote about a part state-owned construction equipment company based in Hunan. Police in Hunan have confirmed the journalist has been detained for "damage to business reputation''. Earlier this year, Mr Chen wrote several reports about Zoomlion, which is partly owned by the Hunan provincial government. Zoomlion issued a statement after one New Express article, which alleged it had improperly accounted for sales, caused its share price to drop. In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange in late May, the company called the claims "false, groundless and misleading". The New Express led its article with a large three-character headline that read "Please Release Him". It said it had remained quiet so far because it feared Mr Chen, who was detained on 19 October, might be mistreated. "We always thought that as long as we report responsibly then there would be no problem; and even in the event of a problem, we can publish corrections and apologise; if it is really serious, and we lose a court case, we will pay or shut down if we have to," the editorial said. "But the fact is, we are too naive. Chen Yongzhou had spent three days and three nights [in custody] before he saw a lawyer," it added. Like all Chinese newspapers, the New Express comes under strict state control, but it has nonetheless gained a reputation for investigative journalism, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai. "We are a small newspaper, but we have the backbone no matter how poor we are," the paper said in its piece. Recent years have seen sporadic clashes between Chinese media outlets and the authorities. In January, journalists at the Guangdong-based Southern Weekly newspaper called for a propaganda chief to quit, after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute. The row sparked small protests and displays of solidarity from other media outlets before the issue was resolved. There have been strong reactions to the news of Chen Yongzhou's detention from users of weibo, China's version of Twitter. Around 30 lawyers have put forward their names to rally support for Mr Chen and organised a virtual body - "Observation Group on the Detention of New Express Reporter Chen Yongzhou". But the group have not said what they plan to do. Media professionals, including journalists, are also using weibo to join the call for police to release Mr Chen. An editor from Dongfang Jinbao, a Henan-based newspaper, wrote: "Support New Express to safeguard the rights of its journalists. The bottom line of consensus in today's society is rule of law. Why did the police arrest Mr Chen? On what legal basis? Is it detention or arrest?" Weibo users have also commented on the censorship of the news of Mr Chen's detention. Another journalist from Henan province added: Within 10 minutes, all major internet portals like Sina, Sohu, Tencent and others have withdrawn the story from their home pages. This is a moment of shame for all (except a few) journalists in China. Other users, however, are urging restraint, saying that it is not good to jump to any conclusions now. The appeal by the New Express comes as the administration led by President Xi Jinping takes a tough approach to press and internet freedom. China's 250,000 journalists and reporters are currently undertaking compulsory on-the-job training. Critics say its apparent aim is to make sure that journalists toe the party line. Some internet bloggers with large numbers of followers on weibo have been arrested for allegedly "spreading rumours". Other high-profile bloggers have stopped posting comments on sensitive issues, apparently fearing reprisals by the government. Rights group Reporters Without Borders has added Xi Jinping to a list of 39 leaders and groups identified as Predators of Freedom of Information in 2013. </body>

      <body>A judge has sentenced an Ohio man who confessed in an online video to a fatal drink-driving crash to six years in prison. Matthew Cordle, 22, had faced up to eight years for the crash that killed Navy veteran Vincent Canzani in June. In a video posted to YouTube in September, he confessed to the crime and promised to plead guilty. Franklin County Judge David Fais revoked Cordle's driving privileges for life as required by state law. In Wednesday's sentencing, the judge read a letter from Vincent Canzani's ex-wife, who said she believed her former husband would not have wanted a maximum sentence. She said she believes Cordle's promise never to drink and drive again. Cordle's father, Dave Cordle, did not ask for leniency as he told the judge he was "disappointed, disgusted and heartbroken" at his son's actions on the night of the crash. In the video, Cordle said he was confessing and accepting responsibility in order to discourage others from drinking and driving. "I'm begging you," he said towards the end of the three-and-a-half minute video, "please don't drink and drive. Don't make the same excuses that I did". </body>

      <body>India and China have signed an agreement on border defence co-operation after a stand-off between their armies in disputed territory earlier this year. The deal aims to improve communication between the two armies. The agreement was signed during Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Beijing. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said it would help maintain border "peace, tranquillity and stability". The two countries disagree over the demarcation of several Himalayan border areas and fought a brief war in 1962. Tensions still flare up from time to time. Both sides are keen to ensure that the spat does not derail a general warming in relations. "Both Prime Minister Singh and I agree that there are far more common interests than differences between China and India," Mr Li told a joint press conference with Mr Singh. "China and India are two old civilisations. Our two peoples have the wisdom and our two governments have the ability to manage our disputes along the border so that it won't affect the overall interests of our bilateral relations," the Chinese leader added. The Indian PM said: "Premier Li and I have agreed that peace and tranquillity on our borders must remain the foundation for growth of the India-China relationship, even as we move forward the negotiations toward a fair, reasonable and mutual acceptable settlement to the India-China boundary question." The two prime ministers also discussed trade at their Wednesday meeting - India is seeking greater access to Chinese markets and wants to attract Chinese investment. The two countries signed nine agreements in total, including a deal to strengthen co-operation on trans-border rivers and transport. China is already one of India's top trading partners and the Asian neighbours are the world's two most populous countries. </body>

      <body>South Korea's largest tobacco company has promised to change an advertising campaign after accusations of racism. Posters promoting a new line of cigarettes featured pictures of monkeys dressed as news reporters, declaring "Africa is coming!" The cigarettes are part of a new This Africa line. The company, KTandG, says they contain African tobacco roasted and dried in a traditional fashion. The cigarette packets contain images of monkeys roasting tobacco. "We are deeply offended by KTandG's shameless and insulting use of this mocking imagery," said the African Tobacco Control Alliance in a statement calling for the withdrawal of the ad campaign, saying it was "at a minimum culturally insensitive". It added: "Mocking Africa to sell a product that causes death and disease is unacceptable, and we will not stand for the exploitation of Africa by tobacco companies." The advertisements were displayed at convenience shops across the country. A KTandG company spokeswoman told news agency AFP it would pull the ads this month. She called the controversy "regrettable" and said the company wished to "dispel concerns of racism". "We absolutely had no intention to offend anyone and only chose monkeys because they are delightful animals that remind people of Africa," she said. "Since this product contains leaves produced by the traditional African style, we only tried to adopt images that symbolise the nature of Africa." However, she said the cigarette packet images would remain, as the company does not consider them to be offensive. </body>

      <title>Mozambique warned of conflict risk</title>
      <description>Zimbabwean officials say they will not accept a return to conflict in neighbouring Mozambique, days after ex-rebels withdraw from a 1992 peace accord.</description>

      <body>Zimbabwe has urged rebels in Mozambique not to fight, after an opposition group with military and political wings withdrew from a 1992 peace deal. Zimbabwe's Deputy Foreign Minister Christopher Mutsvangwa told the BBC that he would not countenance a return to civil war in Mozambique. The Renamo movement, thought to have about 1,000 fighters as well as 51 MPs, ended the peace accord on Monday. Mozambique's 1976-1992 civil war led to about a million deaths. Mr Mutsvangwa said Renamo should rejoin the political process, not threaten regional stability. He told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama should "never, never" return to violence. "Southern Africa will not countenance this. We simply do not need this in this region at this juncture," he said. He added that regional body Sadc (Southern African Development Community) would consider sending troops to help the government if the security situation deteriorated. "It will be misguided for Renamo to bring instability and expect Zimbabwe to watch," he said. Renamo pulled out of the peace accord after government forces captured Mr Dhlakama's base in the Gorongosa mountains in central Mozambique on Monday, forcing him to flee. Rebel fighters retaliated by opening fire on a police station in the town of Maringue, about 35km (20 miles) from the base, state-run Radio Mozambique reported. The US has urged the two sides to "move back from the brink". "We are encouraging the two parties to take visible and decisive steps to de-escalate the current tense environment," said US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf. Mozambique's economy has been booming in recent years, with the discovery of a major offshore gas field in 2011. Mozambican mediator Lourenco do Rosario said he had held talks with Renamo to ease tension. He said Renamo leaders had told him they did not want to return to war. Renamo MPs attended a parliamentary session on Wednesday, despite pulling out of the peace accord. "We are continuing our work as usual," senior Renamo MP Vicente Ululu told the BBC. Renamo's 51 MPs make it the largest opposition party. Mozambique's President Armando Guebuza, who is touring the central region, called on Mr Dhlakama to resume dialogue with the government. Mr Ululu said he did not believe the president was serious about talks. Renamo was supported by South Africa's former white-minority regime during the civil war that raged after Mozambique's independence in 1975. After Robert Mugabe came to power in Zimbabwe, he backed Mozambique's Frelimo government. Renamo has contested elections since the end of the civil war, but has failed to dislodge Frelimo from power Mozambique is due to hold local elections in November, and presidential and parliamentary elections next year. Renamo has complained that the Frelimo government is determined to hold on to power and has failed to create conditions for free and fair elections. Frelimo denies the allegations and says Renamo does not have support among voters. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

      <title>French bust 'vintage wine scam'</title>

      <body>French police say they have broken up a scam in which fake bottles of a top French wine were sold. They say the fraudsters netted up to 2m euros ($2.75m; £1.7m) from the scheme. Bottles of poor-quality wine were allegedly relabelled as Romanee-Conti, a Burgundy that is one of the world's finest and most expensive wines. Two Italian wine merchants have been arrested. They are suspected of selling 400 fake bottles - though it is feared many more may be on the market. French prosecutors say counterfeit labels were treated with wax to make them look older, and the result was so good that the bottles were near-perfect copies of the real thing. French police started an investigation after the vineyard said it had become aware of inferior copies being sold. Their investigation reached six European countries, including Britain and Italy. France has requested the extradition of the two Italians - a father and son - arrested in their home country. Several others have been arrested or questioned. Dijon prosecutor Marie-Christine Tarrare said: "Other suspects are being sought so that we can present this entire counterfeiting network in evidence." Romanee-Conti, like other Burgundy reds made from the pinot noir grape, is produced on a small estate of just 1.8 ha (four acres), making it highly exclusive. In 2011 a 12-bottle case of the 1990 vintage went for $297,000 (£183,000) at auction. </body>

      <title>China sackings over ruined frescos</title>
      <description>Two officials in China are sacked after unauthorised restorers paint over ancient Buddhist temple frescos with cartoon-like figures from Taoist myths.</description>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <body>The Vatican has launched its own official cricket club as part of efforts to encourage interfaith dialogue. The St Peter's Cricket Club is the brainchild of Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy. He described it as an example of "sporting diplomacy" which would present the opportunity to play the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. The next stage is to select an official cricket team. Mr McCarthy estimates that there are between 250 and 350 potential players from around the world studying in seminaries and religious universities in Rome - many of them from cricket loving countries. The board will stage a limited-overs tournament which will give students and priests a chance to compete for a place on the team, to be known as the Vatican XI. The team will sport the official colours of the tiny city-state - yellow and white. Their jackets will have the seal of the papacy - two crossed keys. Speaking at the launch, Monsignor Melchor Sanchez, who is the honorary president of St Peter's Cricket Club said "this represents the council's desire to go to the peripheries of the world that Pope Francis has spoken of." And the chairman of the club, Father Theodore Mascarenhas, an Indian priest known for his off-spin bowling, was confident about the Church's skills. "The team will be strong enough to beat anyone in the world," Father Mascarenhas said. Pope Francis is known to like football. He is a fan of the San Lorenzo football club in his native Argentina. But Father Mascarenhas said the Pope - who he described as an open man - would embrace a new sport. "I think cricket is another thing that would be part of that openness." The St Peter's Cricket Club has already laid down its first challenge to the Church of England and asked for a match at Lord's in September next year. </body>

      <title>Pakistan PM and Obama to talk drones</title>
      <description>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is to meet President Barack Obama to press for an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new relationship.</description>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif is due to meet President Barack Obama in the White House seeking an end to drone strikes and the formation of a new post-Afghanistan war relationship. But correspondents say that few breakthroughs are expected on contentious issues on their agenda. The US is unlikely to offer any assurances on its secretive and controversial drone programme. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived two years ago. In May 2011 al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed by US special forces at his his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without the Pakistani government receiving prior warning from Washington. Relations were further strained by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. "We want to find ways for our countries to co-operate, even as we have differences on some issues, and we want to make sure that the trajectory of this relationship is a positive one,'' White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Mr Sharif said on Tuesday that drone strikes had "deeply disturbed and agitated" Pakistani people and that his government was committed to bringing them to an end. "The use of drones is not only a violation of our territorial integrity but they are also detrimental to our efforts to eliminate terrorism from our country," he said. The prime minister said that the issue had become "a major irritant" in relations with the US. BBC Pakistan correspondent Shahzeb Jillani says that Mr Sharif is seen as adopting a populist stance largely meant for domestic consumption. Washington is unlikely to agree to any curtailment on its secretive and controversial drones programme, our correspondent says. Instead, President Obama will be more interested to hear from Mr Sharif the role Pakistan could play to ease his troubles in Afghanistan as the US prepares to pull out troops next year. Mr Sharif is expected to assure President Obama that his government is keen to ease regional tensions and live in peace with its neighbours, Afghanistan and India. He will be looking for Washington's help in reviving Pakistan's struggling economy and its growing energy crisis. In the end the two sides will meet with their own wish-lists, our correspondent says, but having experienced a low point two years ago this will also be a meeting about having realistic expectations from a complicated relationship. </body>

      <body>A 14-year-old has been charged in the death of a teacher who was found dead in woodland behind her US school. Colleen Ritzer, 24, who taught maths at a high school in the town of Danvers, Massachusetts, was found early on Wednesday after being reported missing. The boy suspect, who is not being named because of his age, is to be charged with murder in a juvenile court. Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said Ritzer was a "very respected, loved teacher". All Danvers schools were closed on Wednesday. Officials said there was no reason to believe there were any other suspects. Mr Blodgett said investigators had found blood in a second-floor toilet at Danvers High School and soon located Ritzer, who lived in the nearby town of Andover. The suspect had also been reported missing after not returning from school. He was spotted by police walking along a road in neighbouring Topsfield at about 00:30 local time on Wednesday (04:30 GMT). Ritzer had a Twitter account where she gave homework assignments, encouraged students and described herself as a "math teacher often too excited about the topics I'm teaching". On Wednesday morning, students were shaken by the death. "We are all terrified," Caitlin McBride, a student at Danvers High School, told the Boston Globe. "It's very scary. No-one will ever look at this school the same way anymore." </body>

      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Chile widows sue Communist leader</title>

      <body>The widows of three Chilean soldiers have launched legal action against the country's Communist Party leader. The Communists' president, Guillermo Teillier admitted his party approved an armed operation targeting the late General Augusto Pinochet in 1986. Five troops escorting the leader died and 11 were injured in the ambush. Around 3,000 people disappeared or died in Chile between 1973 and 1990 and 30,000 are believed to have been tortured by the authorities. In an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in April, Mr Teillier said his party had approved the failed attempt against Gen Pinochet's life and other armed operations in the 1980s. It was "nothing more than a reaction" to what the government had been doing against the Communist leadership, Mr Teillier said. The women taking legal action say they want him jailed for the deaths. "We want justice and equality before the law, that's all we want," one of the widows told Chilean Radio Bio Bio. The recent 40th anniversary of the 1973 coup headed by Gen Pinochet re-ignited nationwide debate about responsibilities and punishment for crimes committed during the period of military rule. The daughters of an ally of the deposed leader Salvador Allende, former President Michelle Bachelet, and of a Pinochet assistant, Evelyn Matthei, are pitted against each other in next months presidential elections, which has heightened the country's political sensitivity further. </body>

      <title>Niger child deaths 'fall sharply'</title>
      <description>Niger has made the greatest strides worldwide in reducing child mortality after tackling hunger and poor healthcare, a new study suggests.</description>

      <body>Niger has made the greatest strides worldwide in reducing child mortality, a new study by Save the Children suggests. Other countries that reported progress in tackling child deaths include Liberia and Rwanda, the charity said. Child mortality rates in Niger fell by almost two thirds because of government policies to curb hunger and poor healthcare, it added. Niger was hit by a severe drought in 2005, causing widespread hunger. It led to aid agencies launching an international campaign to feed hundreds of thousands of people. However, Niger has managed to reduce the deaths of children under the age of five from 326 in 1,000 in 1990 to 114 in 1,000 in 2012, Save the Children says. "Despite having scarce resources and recurring droughts, Niger has cut the number of under-fives dying unnecessarily by nearly two-thirds since 1990 and is on track to achieve the UN's global goal on child mortality," it added in a statement. The charity's West Africa director, Natasha Quist, told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that Niger's government was fulfilling its promise to give free healthcare to pregnant women. "They've declared it and they're doing it," she said. Many women in remote parts of Niger now had access to clinics, Ms Quist said. The government has also implemented effective farming policies, in a radical change from the situation in 2005 when there was "no food, no grain", she said. Other African countries that have significantly reduced child mortality include Madagascar, Egypt and Tanzania. Outside Africa, progress has been reported in China, India and Indonesia, Save the Children says. "At the other end of the spectrum lie Haiti, Papua New Guinea and Equatorial Guinea, with slow and unequal reductions in under-five mortality rates and low levels of investment in health and nutrition." </body>

      <title>Libya al-Qaeda suspect in US court</title>
      <description>Suspected Libyan militant leader Abu Anas al-Liby, seized earlier this month in a US raid in Tripoli, appears for a second time in a New York court.</description>

      <body>A suspected Libyan militant leader seized earlier this month in a US raid in Tripoli has appeared for a second time in a federal court in New York. Abu Anas al-Liby was represented by a lawyer paid for by the Libyan government, a source involved in the case told the BBC. Mr Liby is accused of having links with al-Qaeda and of involvement with the bombings of two US embassies in 1998. He has pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges. Mr Liby, 49, whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, appeared in court to discuss his legal counsel. At his previous hearing, Mr Liby was represented by court-appointed public defenders, having said he could not afford an attorney of his own. A source involved in the case told the BBC's Nada Tawfik at the court that the Libyan government had decided to hire a lawyer to represent him. His lawyer, Bernard Kleinman, declined to say who had retained him. Mr Kleinman told the court that it would take several months to sort through hundreds of thousands of documents before the case could proceed. He also requested the return of Mr Liby's personal copy of the Koran which he said had been confiscated during his capture. Mr Kleinman said he had met Mr Liby for the first time earlier on Tuesday. He told the judge that he represents at least one prisoner held at the US detention centre in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mr Liby's next court appearance was set for 12 December. There has been anger in Libya over the US commando raid on 5 October, which many say was a breach of Libyan sovereignty. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan argued that Libyan nationals should be tried in Libya. However, he said that ties between Tripoli and Washington would not be affected by the issue. Mr Liby was first put on a US Navy ship for interrogation but brought to the US when his health began to deteriorate after he stopped eating and drinking, a US official said. Mr Liby had been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade, with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head. He was indicted by a New York grand jury in absentia in 2000. The attacks on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and the US diplomatic mission in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed more than 200 people and wounded thousands. Most of the victims were civilians. </body>

      <body>Large crowds in the Indonesian province of Yogyakarta have seen the daughter of Sultan Hamengkubuwono X conclude three days of marriage celebrations. Over 750 guests, including Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, attended the wedding. Gusti Ratu Kanjeng Hayu, 29, married Kanjeng Pangeran Haryo Notonegoro, 39, whom she has dated for 10 years. Large crowds of people turned out to greet royal horse-drawn carriages which carried the couple to the royal palace. The wedding celebration was streamed live on the internet. The bride and groom went to the same high school as one another, but 10 years apart. Later they met at a school reunion and got romantically involved when they were in the US. The couple will follow a royal tradition of monogamy embraced by the bride's father. Previously Sultans practised polygamy, but Hamengkubuwono X has just one wife. Born in 1948, Hamengkubuwono X is not only the monarch but also is the governor of Yogyakarta, one of the few remaining kingdoms in Indonesia. He was elected by local MPs in 1998. But the central government in Jakarta wants to introduce changes whereby the governor will be directly elected by voters. As a monarch he only has ceremonial powers. The proposed move has been strongly opposed by the Sultan and local people in Yogyakarta. </body>

      <body>The wreckage of a plane discovered by fishermen in China's Yangtze River has been brought to the surface and identified as a World War II bomber. Four fishermen searching for crabs discovered the wreckage last week. It took two days to salvage the plane from the river. A US scholar says the plane was a B-25 bomber from the "Flying Tiger" squadrons, a special unit of US military pilots tasked with training Chinese pilots in air combat. The undercarriage, engine and fuselage were all brought to the surface, still bearing the "North American Aviation" engraving and with a plate inscribed with the serial number and date of manufacture - 15 February 1943. The US scholar, identified in Chinese media as Patrick Lucas - a descendant of a US air force pilot - identified the plane from photographs as a B-25 bomber. Mr Lucas was said to have travelled to the region six years ago to try to find evidence of the crash site but was unsuccessful. The Flying Tigers came out of a clandestine operation authorised by then-US President Franklin Roosevelt to train Chinese pilots. The American Flying Volunteers, as they were officially called, began their training over Burma in 1941 with 43 fighter planes and 84 pilots; by the end of the war they had been incorporated into a regular US air force unit of more than 700 planes, fighting against Japanese forces over Burma and China. One of the fishermen to discover the wreckage, Ma Jinbin, told the Anhui Business News newspaper that their nets frequently snagged underwater at the crash site, leading them to investigate the cause. </body>

      <body>The international police body Interpol has called on member states to make their national databases of missing people available. The appeal is a further attempt to identify a young blonde girl named Maria, who was found in a Roma camp in Greece last week. A search on Interpol's worldwide database proved unsuccessful. Interpol has also requested that the DNA profile be taken of anyone claiming to be a relative and sent to Interpol. "We took the DNA profile received from the Greek authorities and we compared it to our database. And there was no match," the secretary general of Interpol, Ronald Noble, told AFP news agency. He said he was hopeful that the huge publicity the case had received worldwide might help find some of her relatives. "A DNA profile can be taken by the police anywhere in the world, sent to Interpol and compared to the profile sent to us by the Greek authorities," Mr Noble said. Those countries which do not have national DNA databases are also being encouraged to add all their DNA records of missing children to Interpol's database. On Tuesday the Roma couple, identified by Greek police as Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, were formally charged with abduction and remanded in custody pending their trial. They insist that the girl was given to them legitimately. The case has sparked concern among the parents of missing children around the world. Greek authorities are investigating whether the girl may have been a victim of child trafficking. Criminal organisations bring hundreds of children from the Balkans to Greece, where they are subjected to forced labour, sex-trafficking or sold to couples - in Greece or abroad - in illegal adoption schemes. </body>

      <title>Private christening for baby prince</title>
      <description>The christening of Prince George, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, has taken place in London.</description>

      <body>The christening of Prince George has taken place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London. The prince, third in line to the throne, was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The christening was private, with only senior royals, four members of the Middleton family, the seven godparents and their spouses among the 22 guests. Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was born in London on 22 July. The duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. The godparents, announced earlier, are Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall. Mrs Tindall, wife of former England rugby player Mike Tindall, is Prince William's cousin, while the other six godparents are all friends of the royal couple. Prince George was baptised in a replica of the lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The duke and duchess chose two hymns, two lessons and two anthems for the christening. The hymns were Breathe on Me, Breath of God and Be Thou My Vision. Lessons from St Luke and St John were read by Pippa Middleton and Prince Harry, and the anthems were Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand and the Lord Bless You and Keep You. The anthems were sung by the Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, which performed at the royal couple's wedding. After the ceremony, celebrity photographer Jason Bell was expected to take a picture of the Queen and princes Charles, William and George together. This will echo a 1894 picture from the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother - George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. The picture is expected to be released on Thursday morning. </body>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <body>A 15-year-old Yemeni girl was burned to death by her father for getting in touch with her fiance before their wedding, police say. The 35-year-old man was arrested after the teenager's death in the remote village of Shabaa, in Taiz province. "The father committed this heinous crime on the pretext that his daughter had been keeping in contact with her fiance," a police statement claimed. Local news websites said he had caught the pair chatting on the telephone. Traditional tribal customs in some parts of Yemen prohibit contact between men and women before marriage. Last year, the UN Human Rights council raised concerns about so-called "honour killings" in the country. Perpetrators were not charged with murder, and faced only a six-month to one-year prison sentence, it found. Accorded a low status in the family and community, many Yemeni women are subjected to various forms of violence, deprivation of education, early and forced marriages, sexual abuse, restrictions over freedom of movement, forced pregnancy, and female genital mutilation. Last month, there was an outcry after an eight-year-old girl reportedly died of internal bleeding on the night she wed a 40-year-old man. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth chemical plant to close</title>
      <description>The operator of the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland says the site's petrochemical plant is to close.</description>

      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>ECB outlines bank healthchecks</title>
      <description>Bank shares across Europe fall after details of planned healthchecks of the top lenders were unveiled by the European Central Bank.</description>

      <body>Bank shares across Europe have fallen after details of planned healthchecks on the top lenders were unveiled. The European Central Bank, which takes over supervision of leading eurozone banks next year, said the stress tests would unearth potential risks. Banks with capital shortfalls may be required to bolster their balance sheets, the ECB said. The Euro Stoxx index of big eurozone banks was down more than 2.5% in late morning trading. ECB president Mario Draghi said: "A single comprehensive assessment, uniformly applied to all significant banks, accounting for about 85% of the euro area banking system, is an important step forward for Europe and for the future of the euro area economy. "We expect that this assessment will strengthen private sector confidence in the soundness of euro area banks and in the quality of their balance sheets," he said. The exercise will start next month, and will take about 12 months. The ECB said the aim was to "foster transparency, to repair and to build confidence". Berenberg Bank senior economist Christian Schulz said: "The exercise will increase transparency, trigger further balance sheet repair and restore confidence in the eurozone banking sector. "A successful exercise could complete the process of healing after the Lehman and eurozone crises." A provisional list of banks to be reviewed includes 24 German banks, 16 in Spain, 15 in Italy, 13 in France, seven in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and four each in Greece, Cyprus and Portugal. About 128 banks will eventually be scrutinised to ensure their stability and highlight potential risks to the financial system. An asset quality review will look at "sovereign and institutional holdings and corporate and retail exposures, and both the banking and trading books will be reviewed", the ECB said. Another part of the review will look at liquidity, leverage and funding. Thirdly, the banks will be stress-tested against various scenarios to ensure their resilience to sudden shocks in the banking system. Banks will be required to hold a capital buffer of 8%. When assessing banks' capital, the ECB said it would use the European Banking Authority's definition, which classifies bank loans that are more than 90 days overdue as non-performing. Italian bank shares were hit, and Spain's Bankia fell more than 5%. Germany's Commerzbank was down 3%. The ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will cover 24 banks that make up about 65% of the German banking sector. Bundesbank deputy president Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the process "will be a tour de force for German banks and their supervisors", but added that "the effort will be worthwhile, as the SSM will give us the opportunity of getting the best out of all supervisory cultures in the euro area". </body>

      <title>Glaxo sales tumble 61% in China</title>
      <description>GlaxoSmithKline says its drug sales in China fell by 61% in the third quarter of the year, following a bribery scandal.</description>

      <body>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has said its drug sales in China during the July-to-September quarter sank 61% after it was hit by a bribery scandal. Andrew Witty, chief executive at GSK, said it was too early to predict when the business might recover. But he added there was "absolutely no question" of the company pulling out of China. The pharmaceutical giant allegedly used travel companies to channel 3bn yuan (£300m) to bribe doctors and officials. GSK admitted some of its executives in China broke the law when Chinese authorities took four GSK employees into custody in connection with the allegations earlier this year. "We continue to co-operate with the authorities and we remain fully committed to supplying our products to patients in the country," the company said in a statement. "At this stage, it is still too early for us to quantify the longer-term impact of the investigation on our performance in China." The investigation into GSK, which is one of Beijing's largest into a foreign company, started in July and also includes other pharmaceutical companies. The drop in sales was bigger than many analysts predicted and hit the company's pre-tax profit - which fell 6% to £1.4bn. Mr Witty said the business had suffered most where there had been options from other drug companies. However, GSK predicted its sales growth for the year would be about 1%. The multinational company, which makes Panadol, Sensodyne and Aquafresh among other things, sees China as an important market for future growth. It has a research centre, 7,000 staff and five factories based in the country, although at the moment less than 4% of its sales are generated there. </body>

      <body>Boeing has announced plans to raise production of its 787 Dreamliner to 12 per month by 2016. That would be an increase from its target for the end of this year of 10 planes a month. The Dreamliner has experienced major problems since its introduction two years ago. It was grounded in January of this year for more than three months while investigators examined why batteries were catching fire. Boeing also reported an 11% rise in net earnings to $1.16 billion dollars for the three months to the end of September. That was better than analysts were expecting and Boeing shares rose almost 6%. The strong performance was partly due to its commercial aircraft division where sales rose 15%. Sales at its defence, space and security business rose just 3% and sales of military aircraft fell during the quarter. "Despite the uncertainty of the US defence market, overall our customer focused business strategies and disciplined execution on our programmes are producing the results we expect," said Boeing's chief executive, Jim McNerney. </body>

      <title>Robshaw to captain England in autumn</title>
      <description>Chris Robshaw will captain England in their forthcoming autumn Test series after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood.</description>

      <body>Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will resume the England captaincy in their forthcoming autumn Tests after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood. Robshaw, 27, first led England against Scotland in February 2012 and continued in the role for 16 Tests. But having missed out on a British and Irish Lions place, he was rested for this summer's Argentina tour, when fellow back-rower Wood took over. But head coach Stuart Lancaster has decided to stick with Robshaw. The decision means he is likely to remain at open-side flanker for the matches against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand. "The first and foremost criteria for captaincy is to be on the team sheet and Chris is in there on his playing ability," Lancaster said. "But on top of that he has a massive amount of respect within the squad and has led England well. Every team needs leaders; we are building a strong group and Chris is at the forefront of that leadership." A year ago both Lancaster and Robshaw enjoyed their finest hour in the shock victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham. The uncertain form of his club side Harlequins has meant Robshaw has endured a difficult start to the season. But with his main rival for the number seven shirt, Gloucester's Matt Kvesic, also playing in a struggling side, he has won the battle for both his place and leadership role. "Every time you pull on that white shirt it's a privilege," Robshaw said. "It's a huge honour to be named captain and to lead your country. But I've always said it's not about who you are but what you do and I've got to make sure that I perform as a player first. "We have some good leaders across the squad and I know we will support each other as we head into a massive game against Australia." With Lancaster expected to give Saracens' Billy Vunipola a first start at number eight against Australia on 2 November, the likely inclusion of Wood and Robshaw in the other two back-row positions gives England significant experience for the southern hemisphere tests ahead. Lancaster is "pretty optimistic" that Wood's Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley will be fit to face the Wallabies next week despite the hooker having his foot in a plastic boot after turning his ankle over playing for Saints in their Heineken Cup win over Ospreys on Sunday. Bath prop David Wilson has also also yet to train with the squad at their Leeds base this week and is receiving ongoing treatment for a tight calf. Gloucester's uncapped centre Henry Trinder, a contender to make his debut against Australia, is "progressing well" with a hamstring strain and could return to training on Thursday. But prop Alex Corbisiero remains a doubt for the Wallabies Test as he continues with "off-field" rehabilitation from a knee injury. </body>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace after less than a year in charge. It is unclear whether the 50-year-old resigned, was sacked, or left by mutual consent but the Premier League club are holding a news conference at 17:30 BST. Holloway guided Palace to promotion via the play-offs last season after joining in November 2012, and has won only one league game and lost seven this season. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. Speculation surrounded Holloway's job following a meeting with chairman Steve Parish after the loss to Fulham, with the pair believed to have held further talks on Tuesday. The former Blackpool manager said he spent a long time with his players immediately after the defeat. Speaking before the game at Selhurst Park, Parish had told BBC Radio 5 live that Holloway's position was secure. More to follow. </body>

      <title>I have been treated unfairly - Hock</title>
      <description>Gareth Hock believes his breach of discipline was not serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad.</description>

      <body>Gareth Hock has told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. Hock overslept the next morning, missing a recovery session, and was informed of his dismissal in a phone conversation with coach Steve McNamara. "For missing a 10-minute swim - I think it's out of order really," said Hock. "I agree that it was wrong and we shouldn't have had a drink, but there were six or seven of us and we all did the same thing," he told BBC North West Tonight. England have said they will make no further comment about Hock's removal. Huddersfield's Brett Ferres has been added to the squad in his place. In a statement released late on Tuesday evening, they confirmed the Salford-bound second-rower had been taken out of the 24-man party "as a result of serious breaches of team discipline that have fallen below the strict code of conduct as agreed by team management". Hock's career has been littered with controversy, including a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2009, and he admitted he can understand why people may jump to conclusions about the nature of his indiscretion. He continued: "People are thinking the worst because of the way it's been handled. I know what people will be thinking, and that's up to them. It's come out wrong and people are thinking the worst. "That's the only thing that's happened and I only did the same as what the other lads did, apart from sleeping in for half an hour." An alcohol ban had been imposed on the England squad until after their World Cup opener against pre-tournament favourites Australia in Cardiff on 26 October. But Hock said the ban was broken after they lost their final warm-up match 15-14 to the unfancied Italians in Salford. The former Wigan Warriors man, who has won eight England caps, added: "A few of the boys went out for a few drinks and then went out for a bite to eat. We came back and I overslept. I missed a 10-minute swim and a 10-minute medical check-up. "We were told that there was no drinking until after the Australia game, but we were disappointed about the loss and a few of us had a few drinks. "We got a phone call from Steve to say he'd found out we'd been out, and he would be ringing us back with his decision. He rang me back and said he was going to be taking me out of the squad." Hock, who was unhappy not to be told the news face-to-face, continued: "I blew up a bit and he said the others would be getting disciplined as well, but then afterwards I found out that there was only me being taken out of the squad. I was gutted. I thought it was a bit harsh and I just needed a warning like they did. "I've worked really hard for this and the people in the camp will tell you that. It's embarrassing. "All I can say is 'sorry' again for what I did do, but it's nothing bad compared to what people are thinking." Viewers in the BBC North West region can watch the full extended interview in North West Tonight on BBC One at 18:30 BST on Wednesday evening. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Esytn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>Counter-terrorism saga Homeland has been renewed for another season by US cable channel Showtime, as has 1960s-set drama Masters of Sex. The fourth season of Homeland and the second of Masters of Sex will both comprise 12 episodes and air in 2014. The shows are aired on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday and Tuesday respectively. The most recent instalment of Homeland was watched by 1.97 million, while Tuesday's episode of Masters of Sex attracted 848,000 viewers. The overnight figures are down on the ratings achieved by the shows' debut episodes on 6 and 8 October respectively. Homeland, starring Claire Danes as troubled CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was watched by 3.31 million viewers when it returned to UK screens earlier this month. And the opening episode of Masters of Sex, which stars Britain's Michael Sheen as pioneering sex expert Dr William Masters, drew an audience of 1.43 million two days later. In the US, both shows are broadcast back-to-back on a Sunday night, with the most recent edition of the terrorism drama attracting 1.8 million viewers and Sheen's drama watched by 1.4 million. "Homeland continues to prove its strength for Showtime, and is one of television's most exciting, provocative and widely-discussed shows," David Nevins, president of entertainment at the network, said. "The critical and audience reaction to Masters of Sex since its great launch has been incredibly gratifying. It's a privilege to get to work with such talented and creative people as [Homeland creator] Alex Gansa and [Masters of Sex's] Michelle Ashford, as well as their tremendous casts. "They have each created truly original shows, with distinctive voices that are among the most admired series on television." </body>

      <body>For the first time in the US, a decommissioned prison is to be turned into a facility to help former inmates re-enter the community. And it's happening in the area of New York most in need of it - the Bronx. The facility will be run by the Osborne Association, a not-for-profit group with 80 years' experience working with both the imprisoned and those who have been released from jail. Michael Maher spoke to the association's Elizabeth Gaynes about the novel programme. Altered States is a series of video features published every Wednesday on the BBC News website which examine how shifting demographics and economic conditions affect America on a local level. </body>

      <title>Roma cases raise children concerns</title>
      <description>Concerns for Roma children in marginalised communities</description>

      <body>The high-profile cases of two young girls in Greece and Ireland have highlighted the treatment of children in Roma communities across Europe. DNA tests conducted in central Greece on a blonde-haired girl known as Maria have shown that the couple looking after her were not her biological parents. Tests are currently being carried out on a girl taken into care in Dublin, although a woman identified as her sister has told Irish media she has been in the family since she was born in 2007. Police were not satisfied with a birth certificate and passport provided by the family, reports say. Both stories, one on the western fringes of Europe and the other in the east, involve blonde-haired girls with disputed documents. "Not all Roma communities have dark skin: there are Roma who have light skin and green eyes," says Dezideriu Gergely, head of the Budapest-based European Roma Rights Centre. He is concerned about the dangers of racial profiling and insists Maria's case in Greece should be viewed as unusual. While it is not uncommon for children to be raised by extended families, for example by grandparents, Mr Gergely considers it rare for children to be brought up beyond their biological families. "Definitely there is a need for an answer. Something was not right and that is for the court to investigate." What alarms him is the labelling of an entire community. There has been widespread interest in Maria, particularly because of the high-profile disappearances of two British blonde-haired children: Madeleine McCann in Portugal in 2007 and Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. Indeed, the authorities have themselves internationalised the story with Interpol asking 190 countries to check for a possible match to Maria's DNA, to assess whether she has been a victim of child abduction or trafficking. Mr Gergely believes the latest cases may resurrect old hatreds and myths of babies being stolen. Roma in already-marginalised communities such as Serbia have complained of racial discrimination. But he does acknowledge that the Roma may have been exposed to child traffickers. "It's true the Roma are a vulnerable group because of extreme poverty, low income and low levels of education. But it's not related to cultural factors or to do with the Roma community, let's say, getting involved in trafficking." The UN children's agency Unicef has told the BBC that Roma communities are often used by traffickers because they are seen as "under the radar of society". As many as 3,000 children in Greece are in the hands of child-trafficking rings originating in Bulgaria, Romania and other Balkan countries, Unicef says. Most cases are not thought to involve abduction but rather the buying and selling of children for a few thousand euros. Part of the problem in Greece appears to lie in its localised and out-of-date child-registration system. And yet, ever since the mid-1990s, the European Union has tried to ensure all Roma communities across Europe are fully registered. Most Roma, some 95%, are in settled communities in the EU and both Maria's case and that of the girl in the Tallaght suburb of Dublin involve settled families. In other words, there is no obvious need for paperwork problems. But for all the efforts to bring Roma families into national databases, many are still clearly beyond the system. The couple who registered Maria, according to the Greek authorities, used false identification and claimed to have had six children in under 10 months. And Greece's supreme court has called for an urgent investigation across the country into birth certificates issued since 2008. The prosecutor's order warns that Maria's case may not be unique. "This could have happened in other parts of the country," it warns. In Ireland, too, there are concerns about the registration system, which have alarmed Siobhan Curran, Roma project co-ordinator at the Pavee Point travellers and Roma centre. She has seen many in Ireland's 5,000 Roma population struggle to get hold of social benefits because of what she sees as "very harsh criteria" needed to meet what is known as the habitual residence condition. Poor literacy and language can also be a problem for Roma looking for a job when they try to register for the Personal Public Service number (PPS), required for tax purposes. She describes a vicious cycle where families are unable to obtain a medical card because they are unable to prove they are entitled to one. When they fail to take a child to a local doctor for care, social services are then called in. "Social workers have contacted us with very serious child protection concerns. They have told us in some cases they have very little option but to take a child into care to give them access to services." Although Ireland historically has been known for its traveller community, many Roma arrived only in recent years looking for a better life when countries such as Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic entered the EU. Europe's total Roma population is thought to be as high as 10-12 million, with Turkey having an estimated population of 2.75 million and Romania with some 1.85 million. Siobhan Curran warns against sensationalising the issue by drawing comparisons between the latest cases in Dublin and central Greece. "Any child protection case has to be taken seriously," she says. "But we need to challenge the starting point that there's a connection between Roma and child trafficking." </body>

      <title>Captain Collette, a woman on the front line</title>
      <description>What is it like being a woman in charge on the frontline?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24622762</url>
      <date>1382486158</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645860_collette_cu_320.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Capt Ashley Collette was the only woman in her platoon of soldiers on the Afghan front line - and she was in charge. In the Canadian armed forces, unusually, every job is open to women - and both sexes live together and fight together. On the first day that Capt Ashley Collette and her platoon of 60 men were deployed in the remote town of Nakhonay, near Kandahar, they came under attack. "I don't think that the enemy liked our presence," she says with a soldier's understatement. "It's kind of in the middle of where they want to be." That first day set the pattern for the next few months. Twice a day, Six Platoon - part of Bravo Company in the First Royal Canadian Regiment - endured enemy fire, both on patrol and directly on the camp. It was so regular that the soldiers nicknamed it "contact o'clock". But Collette says being shot at made a sort of sense to her troops - they could see the bullets lighting up the sky and mountains as they came towards them. It was the IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and - towards the end of their rotation - suicide bombs, that wore on their nerves. On 21 June, Sgt Jimmy MacNeil, an engineer attached to the platoon, was killed by a bomb while on a foot patrol. He was a kind, popular soldier, and a close friend of Collette's. The hours following his death were frantically busy and it wasn't till later in the day that she got a chance to reflect. Then she went and sat by herself on a sandbank in the camp. "We still had six months to go," she says. "I remember thinking 'How am I, one, going to hold it together myself, and two, going to hold together this group of 60 people who are devastated by this event?'" Then, two of her men came and sat next to her, one on either side. Neither said anything - and she knew that she didn't need to say anything, that they understood how she felt. Collette did hold it together. After returning from her tour, she was awarded the Medal of Military Valour, one of Canada's highest military honours, for her leadership in Afghanistan. (She is keen to attribute the accolade to the work of her whole platoon.) Around 12% of soldiers serving in the Canadian army are women and they have been integrated into combat positions since 1989. The US and Brazil are currently in the process of working out the best way to place women in combat roles. The UK, which has not yet taken this step, will review its policy in the next five years. Those who argue against putting women into combat sometimes say that a woman would not be able to carry a wounded fellow from the battlefield. Collette says she was tested every year in "soldier carry" and "soldier drag" exercises. Although she was paired with someone of a similar weight to herself, lifting bigger people using the "fireman's carry" is not as hard as you might think when you know how. A priority in any infantry unit is to develop team cohesion. The traditional way to do this is to train, eat and sleep as a unit. But when Canadian female soldiers were first placed on the front line, they were segregated from the men. It didn't work. Now they are mixed in together, and sleep in the same dorm. This does present some logistical challenges, but Collette took pains to be modest. While the men slept in boxer shorts, she would wear pyjamas. While training in Canada, she would climb into a cupboard to change, or pull her sleeping bag around her and change underneath. "Normally this would be a successful endeavour," she says wryly, before going on to describe a sleeping bag malfunction in which somehow the thing slipped from her grasp and she was left standing in electric blue knickers and bra. Someone shouted "Look at Ashley!" and all the men turned to laugh. "I laugh with them because what can you do? I pull the sleeping bag up and change my clothes and everyone carries on, because you have way bigger things to worry about." In Afghanistan, she shared a room roughly 3m x 4.5m (10ft by 15ft) with up to 10 people. But if anybody needed privacy they would just ask for it. When you share a small space with a group of men for a length of time, they become like your brothers, she says. When men from other units came to her platoon and made the mistake of commenting on her appearance, her own soldiers cut them down. "Soldiers from my platoon would look at those attachment soldiers and say, 'That's really irrelevant in this scenario. Keep your comments to yourself - that's our platoon commander.'" After her return from Afghanistan, some of her men approached her with a confession. "They said, 'In the beginning we were wary of you, but now we would follow you anywhere,'" she says. But then, she believes it's natural for soldiers to be wary of a new commander, regardless of the gender. "They always want to feel out your style of leadership." She describes her own style as compassionate - "I believe in second chances" - and perhaps a little more democratic than some, prepared to listen even to the lowest ranks. But she quickly adds that she is authoritative when she needs to be. A particular concern to her before her rotation was how she would be received by the Afghan village community - whether her sex would prevent her from establishing vital links with local leaders. "I thought that they wouldn't even listen to me, I thought that they would poke fun at me," she says. "But they didn't care at all." And this was in Panjwaii district, the Taliban's birthplace. She was very popular with the village children, especially the girls, who would run after her with gifts of jewellery - but Collette says this was because she was kind, not because she was a woman. Although the village chiefs accepted the fact of Collette's gender, their wives were incredulous. After she had been in Nakhonay for about a month she was summoned to have tea with them and was quizzed about everything from what she liked best about Afghanistan to when she was going to settle down with a nice Muslim boy. The occasion was made even more surreal by the fact that her interpreter was not permitted in the room because he was male. Consequently, they were forced to make small talk at the top of their voices, so they could be heard through the walls. Since her deployment, Collette has married and is currently taking a break from active service to complete an MA in social work. But she has every intention of returning to uniform, as a mental health specialist. She is passionate that people see her as a soldier, rather than a "woman soldier" and describes the whole debate about whether women can handle a combat job as "null and void". "In my experience," she says, "there's no reason why a band of brothers cannot be a band of brothers and sisters."

      <body>Syria's brutal civil war is pushing a new wave of migrants towards Europe. Their numbers have surged, but many asylum seekers in Europe have also fled the conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. European governments are struggling to co-ordinate their response to the influx. Large movements of migrants from country to country quickly fuel suspicions that some politicians are trying to shift the burden onto their neighbours. Greece and Italy - major entry points for migrants - say there must be more burden-sharing in the EU, especially as they have been hit hard by the eurozone crisis. Migrants continue to board overcrowded, rickety boats, risking their lives. The recent deaths of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean highlighted their plight. Asylum is granted to those who say they are fleeing persecution and who can convince the authorities that they would face harm or even death if they were to be sent back. Nearly a quarter of asylum applications in the EU are handled by Germany. France is the second biggest destination for asylum seekers. But often English-speaking migrants head for the UK, which is home to large communities from Pakistan, Somalia and Middle Eastern countries. Among the asylum seekers from Russia there are many Chechens, whose homeland was devastated by war between separatist rebels and Russian troops. The asylum seekers from Serbia include many Roma and ethnic Albanians, who complain of discrimination in Serbia. The global asylum picture shows the US is the top destination for asylum seekers, but Germany and France are second and third. Sweden, with a much smaller population, is fourth, ahead of the UK. Europe is the main destination for asylum seekers by far. For many of them it is easier to reach overland or by boat, especially those fleeing conflicts in the Middle East or Africa. And people traffickers already have well-established smuggling routes to Europe. The figures illustrate why immigration has become such a hot topic in Europe. Globally Afghanistan ranks first in terms of asylum seekers' country of origin. But the war in Syria has pushed that country into second place. China and Pakistan are also major countries of origin. Both countries have minorities and dissidents who oppose the government. </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>The four sisters who took on Botswana's chiefs</title>
      <description>Four Botswana sisters who gained the right to inherit property</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24623692</url>
      <date>1382487225</date>

      <body>In many countries across Africa, the right of the firstborn male, or closest male relative, to inherit family property - is still standard practice. Women are denied the right to inherit the family estate purely because of their gender, a custom that is upheld by some traditional leaders. But four sisters in Botswana did something that no-one there thought was possible - they took on tradition and won. Last month, a five-year legal struggle ended with a landmark victory to Edith Mmusi (80) and her three sisters Bakhani Moima (83), Jane Lekoko (77), and Mercy Ntsehkisang (68). Inside her modest home in a village in Kanye, a small town south of the capital Gaborone, Ms Mmusi has a wry smile as she speaks of the lengthy case. "It took resilience and courage to get this far. It was a stressful time for the family that gave me many sleepless nights. I am glad it is finally over," she says. This is the family's ancestral home - a compound of some eight concrete houses in various sizes, built on the Ramantele family plot. Over the years it was sub-dived to accommodate members of the family who wanted to live close to the elders. The house at the centre of the row was built on the land where Ms Mmusi's old family home once stood. What remains of that house is a wall of mud, bricks and mortar, the only reminder of the house Ms Mmusi and her sisters had lived in with their parents as young girls. "This is the only home we've known here. We helped to build one of the first mud houses in this big yard," she tells me, a big smile on her face. It is easy to see that this place means a lot to them, as they share their childhood memories of growing up here. When their father died, Ms Mmusi and her sisters contributed to the upkeep of the homestead and looked after their mother until her death in 1988. In court the sisters argued that they were entitled to the family home as they had used their own finances to renovate the property. The Appeals Court agreed, finding that denying them this right went against the constitution. But this was not an easy victory. Traditional values are held in high regard here, as in many rural areas in Africa. Tswana custom prescribes that the family home is inherited either by the first-born or last-born son, depending on the community. As a result, their nephew had earlier won the case at the Customary Court of Appeal which found that under his ethnic group's customs, women could not inherit the family home. That court had ordered that Edith and her sisters be evicted from the family home. As a last-ditch attempt to avoid eviction, the sisters took the matter to the High Court and later the Appeals Court, which both ruled in the women's favour. But this has been a bitter-sweet time for the family, and the matter has caused divisions in the family. Some male members feel the women belittled their culture by challenging it, Ms Mmusi tells me. Something she says she hopes will change with time. "Customs and culture have no place in the modern world because women are still oppressed in the name of culture." "What makes men [especially the staunch traditionalists] think they have power over us? We are all equal in God's eyes," she adds, the smile now gone. But why are some people against women inheriting the family home? In its broadest sense, traditionalists argue that the only way of preserving family wealth is by passing on the inheritance only to the males, arguing that women may take that wealth to another family after they marry. But African cultural expert Moses Twala, of the Kara Heritage Institute, believes this ruling should compel traditional leaders to take a closer look at what they are doing. "Culture is not static, culture is dynamic because it conforms to the times, especially with the fact that people are getting more and more modernised with the times," he says. He says inheritance should not be seen as something that will benefit one person, but rather as something that will see to the wellbeing of the entire family once the head of that home has died. He argues that women are as capable of carrying that responsibility as males. "A family is not one person only who is a male. Females also play a very big role also in uniting the very same family even when males are present," he told the BBC. But Botswana is largely a conservative country. While a handful of chiefs in Botswana are for promoting gender equality, they say this should be done in a manner that still shows respect to age-old traditions. "Yes culture is dynamic but tradition is important, the role of tradition is to preserve our identity. We would like to preserve our culture and live in the way that our great-grandfathers lived," says Chief Gaseintswe Malope II. As head of the Bangwaketse people, the third biggest community in Botswana, he says it is his responsibility to make sure his people honour their traditions. Modern law and African culture are in many instances still poles apart and sometimes in direct contradiction, according to women right's activists. Women's Inheritance Now, a group advocating the inheritance rights of women, believes the judgment will go a long way to bring change to Botswana. Back in Kanye, Ms Mmusi is hopeful that the case will inspire other women to stand up for what they believe in. "It will give them motivation and comfort that they are not the only ones going through that, where they are. We hope they will say: 'These women took action and they won' and do the same too. We are overjoyed," she says. </body>

      <title>Maid to entrepreneur: Rising out of poverty in Brazil</title>
      <description>One woman's rise out of a life of poverty in Brazil</description>

      <body>Lucineide do Nascimento has come a long way from her birthplace near Natal in the poor north-east of Brazil. Had things gone according to her father's plans, she would have been married as a teenager and followed a traditional rural lifestyle - living off produce grown on the family farm. But she decided to move south and live a different life. "I was a rebel and went against my parents' wishes," says Ms Nascimento, now aged 44. She is a small entrepreneur - and her story illustrates the recent social change that has transformed the lives of millions of people in Brazil - many of them women. Her journey was not easy. She left her family home at 17, moved to Rio de Janeiro and became a maid, a popular job among poor Brazilian women who have little education. She says she faced prejudice and was so naive she thought she did not have the right to be paid a regular salary because she lived in her employer's home. Ms Nascimento soon grew tired of the job and its uncertainties. She moved to the vast sprawling city of Sao Paulo, where she sold domestic supplies. By then, she was already thinking of ways of fulfilling her dream of having a business of her own. It was 2007, and eco-friendly products were all the rage in Brazil. Ms Nascimento spotted her opportunity. She rang the local Greenpeace office to ask what would be the best material for replacing plastic supermarket bags. "And it turned out to be raw cotton, which was precisely one of the things we used grow on my family farm up north," she recalls. She started crafting the bags at home, after a full day working as a saleswoman, and sold them to other small companies. Her business grew steadily, and today she makes about 10,000 bags per month, employing four people in her small factory in Sao Paulo - including her husband and older son. Her family in the north-east used to think of her as the "black sheep", she recalls. Now she is their pride and joy, as well as a role model for the whole family. "We are a big, humble family of seven siblings. Growing up, we didn't even have electric power. My father was worried about us moving to big cities, he wanted me to marry young and lead a quiet rural life. "But my parents always trusted me, so I thought it was my responsibility to grow in life," she says. "Back then, there was little education in my family; their only plans for the future was to have children of their own. "But I kept telling them that it was important to get an education. Now they all live in the city and many are starting university." With Ms Nascimento's help, her sister's small business selling home-cooked meals has turned into a fully fledged churrascaria - a traditional Brazilian meat restaurant. Ms Nascimento's experience is becoming more common in Brazil, a developing nation where the gap between rich and poor has been narrowing. The changes have been particularly marked for Brazilian women. Falling birth rates mean mothers have smaller families to care for and often do better in their chosen professions. According to Sebrae, a body that promotes entrepreneurship, the number of Brazilian women who became business owners grew by 21% in the past decade, at twice the rate of men. Still, gender inequality persists in the Brazilian labour market. According to official figures, the average Brazilian woman makes almost 30% less money than her male colleague. Ms Nascimento plans to triple her sales in the next few years at her business, Edilu Eco-bags. "Women still face some prejudice, but it's changing. And it's up to us to break the cycle," she says. And her concerns are now those of a typical urban Brazilian woman. "I've learned to delegate tasks to my husband and kids, they help me with the company and with the dishes and handle their own school work. "Now I want to make more time for girly things, for chatting with my girlfriends. I've learned that life is more than work and family!" </body>

      <description>Mapping sexual harassment in Indian cities</description>

      <body>"I was going to my college at Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad. I got down from the bus and was walking forward... Suddenly a few men were coming from the front, and two of them walked by my side really close and one of them pinched my breast..." This entry from the southern Indian city is one of the hundreds on safecity.in - a website created just days after last December's gang rape of a student in Delhi, to improve reporting and recording of sexual harassment and crimes against women. The website offers an interactive map of the most unsafe places across Indian cities. The Hyderabad entry continues: "I was shocked... I couldn't talk to anyone. I did not report it to the police as I could not see the face of the person who pinched me. There have been similar incidents in this area." In India, sexual assault of women occurs every three minutes and data from the government's National Crime Records Bureau suggests that a woman is raped every 20 minutes. And these are crimes that have been reported to the police and are registered officially. Thousands of incidents like the one at Dilsukhnagar are never registered and do not get into the crime records - something that safecity.in wants to change. Founded by Surya Velamuri, Else Disilva, Saloni Malhotra and Aditya - a group of four young professional men and women - the website has created a "crowd-sourced" map of sexual harassment, covering safe and unsafe places across India. And anyone, from anywhere in the world, can report an incident of sexual abuse on safecity. "As women in the group, we asked ourselves what is it that has troubled us in various ways all through these years," says Surya Velamuri. "Our aim was to customise it to Indian behaviour so we included categories like cat-calling, touching and groping, sexual invites, indecent exposure, et cetera." Since its inception last year, safecity.in has received more than 962 reports of sexual abuse from across India with the capital, Delhi, recording the maximum number of complaints with 781. And the numbers are consistently growing. "The map on our site can help in many ways. If you are a woman travelling to a new city, a look at the map will instantly tell you about the safe and unsafe locations," Ms Velamuri says. "Also, if we see lots of reports coming from a specific area in a city, it can actually help the police and administration nail the possible reasons that make it unsafe, like poor lighting, insufficient patrolling or the presence of rogue elements," she adds. What makes the website popular with its women users is the anonymity they enjoy. "We realised that women in India are usually scared and [too] shy to report sexual abuse. They do not like their names and identities to be revealed, but here you can post as an anonymous user." But that creates a problem of a different kind. As most women visitors to the site do not leave their names or contact details, it makes it difficult to verify the reports, says Ms Velamuri. Safecity has recently joined hands with Goa police and any user willing to make a formal complaint in the Goa region can disclose their identity to the police and get their case registered. Ms Velamuri says the group is working on more such tie-ups with police in other cities and towns. The group at present is working on a project to map the 100 most unsafe places in the capital, Delhi, and its surrounding areas. A team of volunteers is collecting - and plans to upload - more than 100,000 reports of sexual crimes from Delhi residents. The next step, Ms Velamuri says, will be to take up these reports with the police and local authorities. Success, however, is still far away. In a country of 1.2 billion people, India has only 130 million internet users and with limited internet penetration in rural India, safecity.in has a long way to go before it can map every corner of the country. </body>

      <title>US survivors recall 1983 Beirut bombing</title>
      <description>The bombing of US marine base in Beirut, 30 years on</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24627182</url>
      <date>1382486862</date>

      <body>On 23 October 1983, bombs exploded in Beirut, killing 241 US service members and 58 French paratroopers. Survivors describe what happened on that day - and afterwards. The multinational force of American, French, British and Italian soldiers was deployed to Lebanon following the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps by militiamen. Their mission: to back the Lebanese Armed Forces and help them establish and maintain sovereignty over war-torn Beirut. The operation was intended to be brief. But in April 1983, the US embassy in Beirut was destroyed, and the situation for the multinational force deteriorated from there. Then the US marines and the French paratroops were attacked - in two separate suicide bombings, occurring at about the same time. Soon afterwards US troops and other members of the multinational force pulled out of Lebanon. And the survivors of the attacks tried to get on with their lives. I woke up and got dressed, brushed my teeth, shaved and started to listen to some music on my walkman. A half hour later I heard a loud explosion. I got out of my bunker and saw a huge plume of smoke. And then I heard people yelling that they hit the battalion. I saw caravans of trucks and marines racing towards the battalion. I was in Beirut until November. I had nightmares, anger - and pulled away. To this day my dad, mom, brother, wife and children don't know what I saw. I was on watch, manning communications. I was relieved from my post and returned to my bunk. I lay down to sleep and the next thing I knew I awoke under two huge concrete pillars. They were lodged on top of me. I was able to escape, and I stumbled around. Everywhere you looked, there were parts of the building or a dead marine or a body part. The building was gone, reduced to a smouldering pile of rubble about 60ft (18m) high. I saw marines burned by battery acid, which had drained on to victims who were pinned with no way to escape. I heard faint voices and cries out to God for help. There was an awful smell in the air, and I could taste dirt and grit inside my mouth. The experience has caused me great pain and anguish over the years and even today it continues to be an ever-present part of me. We had rigging to hang mosquito nets, which we also used to air out our uniforms and to dry out our towels. That saved me from blast wounds as the shards of glass and fractured concrete whirled about. In my underwear I picked my way through the debris to the operations centre, located down a narrow hall in the main building. Wires hung, dangling like wet spaghetti. I spied my deputy struggling up the hill with a badly bleeding marine on his back. I asked him where he was going. He replied that he was taking the marine to the aid station at the Marine Service Support Group because the battalion aid station and all the battalion medical staff were buried in the basement. A fine grey powder of pulverised cement covered everything. It reminded me of a scene of the volcanic eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington three years before - debris and body parts, covered by the fine dust. Off to one side I spied what I first thought to be a ragged tree stump - until I noticed blood oozing from the stump. It was a human leg. Nearby, the lid of an ammunition box was impaled up in a palm tree. Ahead I could see the media waiting. What could I say? I didn't know what the answers were myself. I organised my teams to take groups of newsmen and photographers around the rubble, letting them document the 40ft-wide crater. I live with what happened in Beirut almost every day. But I am determined to let the world know that the bombing did not defeat us. We are still here. I thought, "What... was that?" To this day I can smell it, and I can hear the screams for help, I can feel the dust upon my skin. I can feel the reverberations and the concussion in my body from the explosion - and the ringing in my ears. I feel guilty that I lived through it. Now I stay in my "bunker" at home, a trailer where I have been living since 2001. I am at peace in my own little world - me and my two dogs. A wise veteran once said for those who died the war is over. For the rest of us it is only a nightmare away. Reported and written by Alasdair Soussi </body>

      <title>Grangemouth chemical plant to close</title>
      <description>The operator of the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland says the site's petrochemical plant is to close.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24631342</url>

      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <body>A number of people have been arrested in Scotland under the Terrorism Act during an operation focused on dissident Irish Republicans. Police Scotland said they were arrested at several locations under section 41 of the Act "on suspicion of committing various offences". It is believed that those who were arrested are being held at Glasgow's high-security Govan Police Station. The Security Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland were involved. A statement about the operation from Police Scotland Asst Ch Con Ruaraidh Nicolson said: "It focused on the activities of individuals sympathetic to dissident Republicanism but who are not affiliated to any specific group. "Police Scotland has led the operation which has involved a number of officers, including specialist units, and public safety has been a priority throughout. "We are confident as a result of these arrests there is no risk to the public. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage." </body>

      <body>Calls for a ban on items of a sexual nature in Edinburgh's licensed saunas have been withdrawn. Police Scotland had written to councillors asking that licences should only be granted on the condition such items were not allowed on the premises. Safe sex campaigners were angered by the move, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. However, the condition was withdrawn from the council committee without any discussion. And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. Councillors granted new licenses to five of 13 city saunas. They are due to decide in private later whether the remaining eight saunas are also to be granted new licenses. Earlier this year, six other saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". </body>

      <body>Refined petrol and chemicals were among the stronger sectors of the Scottish economy, according to the latest manufactured export figures. According to the Scottish government, total overseas sales grew 3.5% in the second quarter of this year. Engineering also proved to be a strong factor. The strength of refining and chemicals underlined the importance of the closure-threatened Grangemouth complex for the economy. The data shows that refined petrol and chemicals account for nearly a quarter of manufactured goods sold to the rest of the world. Exports over the most recent quarter grew by 4.2%, which was at a slower pace than previous quarters. Overall following poor exports in the second half of 2012, the year-on-year figure for total manufactured exports was down 1.8%. Neil Francis, director of international operations at Scottish Development International, said: "These latest figures reinforce continued global demand for Scottish products, particularly those within the engineering, textiles, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. "With economic recovery gaining momentum, we are seeing more and more Scottish companies look to new and emerging markets such as Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America, as well as sustaining growth in the more traditional economies." He added: "We continue to work hard with our partners to help support ambitious companies with global potential and we are encouraged by the positive outlook for Scotland's manufactured exports." </body>

      <body>The number of people killed on roads has fallen by 6% according to new Scottish government figures. The 2012 figures show the number of road casualties have decreased by 1% on last year and down 34% since 2002. The number of people killed due to drink-drive accidents has also fallen by 43% since 2001. Causalities to cyclists have risen by 9% in comparison to 2011, according to the figures. Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "The latest data confirms road casualties in Scotland are at their lowest level since records began. There is much that is good news in these figures but in some respects we still have a long way to go. He added: "The Scottish Government has invested over £58 million in cycling infrastructure, cycle training and road safety messages. "We will continue to work with our road safety partners to try to enable cyclists to use Scotland's roads safety. "In addition to the funding from this spending review period, £20 million has also been allocated to cycle infrastructure over the next two years to enhance the Community Links programme run by Sustrans Scotland which will be matched by local authorities. Supt Iain Murray, head of road policing at Police Scotland, said: "It is heartening to see such significant reductions in statistics, but it is important to recognise the tragedy that still lies behind the numbers. There is still a lot of work to be done. The figures supersede the provisional road injury and casualties statistics published in June. </body>

      <title>BASF plant closure to hit 141 jobs</title>
      <description>The multinational chemical firm BASF is to close its plant in Renfrewshire with the loss of 141 jobs.</description>

      <body>The multinational chemical firm BASF is to close its plant in Renfrewshire with the loss of 141 jobs. The site, at Hawkhead Road in Paisley, has produced pigments to colour paints, paper and plastics for almost 60 years. BASF said the plant was "not cost competitive" in a "rapidly changing market" and the closure was part of restructuring to its global operations. The plant was originally run by Swiss firm Ciba before being taken over by BASF as part of a £3bn buyout in 2008. BASF made 232 workers redundant at the plant in 2010 as part of moves, which it said, were designed to safeguard its future. In a statement, BASF said the plant was no longer viable and consultations with trade union and staff representatives would begin this week. It added: "The Paisley site manufactures Azo pigments. The global market for these pigments is shrinking. "Increasing manufacturing capacities and the entry of new competitors have changed the business environment significantly. "The Paisley site, which BASF acquired in 2009, is not cost competitive. Restructuring programmes over the last three years have succeeded in reducing fixed costs, but the rapidly changing market situation resulted in unsustainable manufacturing cost at the site." The statement said that a large part of the products manufactured at the Paisley plant were used for printing - a sector which was now shrinking. The firm added: "BASF is adapting its Azo pigment business to these changed market conditions by restructuring measures, including consolidating production at cost competitive sites. "It will stop producing Azo pigments for the printing industry and focus on innovative products, mainly for the plastics industry." The Scottish government described the closure of the Paisley site as "a major concern" for staff and their families. Finance Secretary John Swinney said: "The Scottish government and our agencies will meet with the company as a matter of urgency to discuss options for the site.

      <body>Police and Uefa are investigating scenes of disorder by Ajax fans during their team's Champions League match against Celtic on Tuesday. Trouble flared in the away supporters section after Celtic took a one goal lead in the match which they won 2-1. Police Scotland said they were reviewing CCTV images and would liaise with their Dutch counterparts. Meanwhile, Uefa confirmed that it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Ajax over the scenes of disorder. There were reports that some Ajax fans ripped out seats and threw them after Celtic's first goal. It is also alleged that some fans confronted stewards and police. Police Scotland said: "A full investigation is being carried out into the behaviour of a number of Dutch supporters. "Our officers are reviewing CCTV images. Any information gleaned will be shared with our Dutch counterparts to identify those involved." Police Scotland confirmed no Dutch fans were arrested during the game. Uefa - European football's governing body - said it had decided to take action against Ajax. A spokesman said: "Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against AFC Ajax for crowd disturbances and throwing of objects at last night's Uefa Champions League match in Glasgow against Celtic FC. "The case will be dealt with by the Uefa control and disciplinary body on 21 November." </body>

      <body>A policeman who raped a woman he met on a dating website has been jailed for four years. Khalid Anwar, 40, from Edinburgh, raped the woman at a house in Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, in 2011. The 44-year-old victim told a jury she was attacked after having consensual sex with Anwar five times that day. Anwar denied the charge but was convicted of rape at an earlier hearing in September, when he was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register. During the trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, the woman, cannot be named for legal reasons, also described his behaviour after the rape. Text messages The court had heard about text messages exchanged between the pair after the incident. One sent by the woman included the words: "I'm annoyed you carried on when I asked you not to..." Anwar replied that the woman had "enjoyed it, but in a painful way." The court heard he had sent text messages to his victim threatening to pin up naked pictures of her at work and on her street. The victim told the court: "There were instances where he would turn up at the house uninvited and stuff and I didn't know how I was going to get rid of him." She also told the court of one occasion when the officer had slapped her when he turned up at her house one morning after she had returned from a night shift. As well as the sex attack, Anwar was convicted of a breach of the peace charge as he had left his victim in a "state of fear and alarm". At a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh, Judge Lady Scott heard how Anwar still maintained he was innocent of any wrong doing before ordering him to be taken into custody. She added: "The sentence will be one of four years." </body>

      <title>Serial drug rapist back behind bars</title>
      <description>The first person to be convicted of drug rape in Northern Ireland is jailed for similar offences in Scotland.</description>

      <body>The first person to be convicted of drug rape in Northern Ireland has been jailed for similar offences which he committed after resettling in Scotland. William Fenton, 55, drugged and raped one woman and sexually assaulted three others at his new home in Ayr between June 2011 and April last year. At the High Court in Edinburgh he was given an order for lifelong restriction and told to serve at least six years. In 2000, Fenton was jailed in Northern Ireland over drug-related sex attacks. Jailing him, Lord Burns told Fenton: "You were convicted in May of this year of the rape of one complainer and the sexual assaults of three others having given them some substance which rendered them unconscious." The judge said the offences were serious and bore similarities to previous convictions. Lord Burns said: "In particular, I note you have been convicted in the past of the sexual assault of young girls and of women. "In 2000 you were convicted of rape and later that year indecent assault on a female after administering some stupefying substance upon her. "The risk you present to the public is a high one and you are really a clear danger to females." The judge imposed an order for lifelong restriction and ordered that he serve a minimum term of six years in prison before he becomes eligible to seek parole. Lord Burns told Fenton: "This does not mean you will be released at the end of that period." The judge said that any future decision to allow Fenton out of prison would depend on the view that the parole board took of the risk that he posed to the public. If freed by the parole authorities Fenton would be kept under supervision. Fenton denied the latest charges against him when he was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow earlier this year. His trial heard that the victims knew Fenton as Billy or Irish Billy. All four lost consciousness after being plied with alcohol laced with drugs. One woman had baby oil rubbed on her stomach and back while she was unconscious. Another was kissed and touched on her clothed breasts and repeated attempts were made to part her legs. A third woman was raped while she was unconscious and incapable of consenting. A fourth victim was filmed while she was naked and when Fenton was touching her breasts. </body>

      <description>A security guard charged with murdering a woman with a fire extinguisher at Glasgow's SECC complex says he has no memory of the attack.</description>

      <body>A security guard charged with murdering a woman with a fire extinguisher at Glasgow's SECC complex has said that he has no memory of the attack. Clive Carter made the claim while giving evidence at his trial at the High Court in Glasgow. The 35-year-old has denied murdering conference delegate Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. The court was heard how Mrs Satjawat's blood was found on Carter's trousers, and on the sleeve of his work blazer and cuffs of his shirt. His DNA was also found on the sleeve of the jumper Mrs Satjawat was wearing. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. Giving evidence, father-of-three Carter told defence QC Ian Duguid that he had a row with Mrs Satjawat when she asked why she should show her security pass. Carter said he had gone up to the second floor after hearing a noise. He was heading back down towards the fire stairs when he saw Mrs Satjawat. He said she kept asking why she had to show him her security pass and this made him "angry, frustrated and annoyed". Mr Duguid said: "Your emotions at the time were that she should just die is that correct," and Carter replied: "Yes." He added: "When I was asked about the incident by psychiatrists and psychologists I remembered the argument and I remember saying 'Die, just die' in my head. I didn't say it." Cater told the jury: "I just basically asked do you have your badge. She said: 'Of course.' "She started to get a bit angry about it. I wasn't sure what the problem was. She asked me why. I had a problem understanding what she was saying. Basically she was saying: 'Why do I have to show my badge.' "She said: 'Why is everyone having a go at me,' and I said: 'I just have to see your badge.' "We had a heated debate, an argument. Basically she was asking these questions. I just wanted to see her pass. She was having a go at me. I couldn't understand what she was saying. A lot of it was in broken English." Carter said that after arguing for a couple of minutes Mrs Satjawat pulled out her pass and waved it in his face. After killing her he went on his lunch break and was in the rest room when a colleague said there had been an incident in the ladies toilets. Carter said when he went up he saw Mrs Satjawat lying dead in a cubicle. He was asked how he felt and said: "Shocked, dizzy. I was mortified by the sight of the lady in question." He denied that he had tried to cover up what he had done by hiding his bloodstained blazer and trying to wash blood off the fire extinguisher. Carter also denied having a fascination with fire extinguishers. He was asked by Mr Duguid: "You accept you are responsible for the death of this lady how do you feel about that?" The accused replied: "I hate myself. I still struggle to understand and explain what happened. It doesn't make sense to me. In my own head there's no possible reason for what I did." Carter was then asked if he could think of a reason for what he did and said: "No not really. I know we had an argument, but that was no reason to do what I did." The court heard that Carter had been prescribed anti-depressants by his GP, but was not taking them. He was also attending anger management counselling. Carter admits killing Mrs Satjawat, but denies murdering her claiming diminished responsibility. He claims that he was tired because of the shifts he was working from G4S and said that he had only had two-and-a-half hours sleep before heading for his shift on 12 November 2012. In the two days previously he had worked 24 hours. The trial before Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <body>Scottish brewer BrewDog plans to create 50 new jobs in the next six months after reporting "record growth" in 2013. The Aberdeenshire-based firm said it was on track to turnover £19m, up from £10.8m in 2012. BrewDog is also investing £5m in an expansion of its Ellon brewery. Co-founder James Watt said: "The craft beer revolution has exploded from its niche starting point to an international movement." Some of the new jobs being created are in management, including head of sales. Mr Watt said: "We are growing. Fast. "Our success is a direct result of the awesome team we have built over the past few years." In June, BrewDog announced has raised more than £1m from investors in just 24 hours after launching a crowdfunding scheme to fund expansion plans. Crowdfunding is a method of raising equity by asking a large number of people each for a small amount of money, often via the internet. It has has opened several bars in recent years, including its first international location in Stockholm, Sweden. </body>

      <title>Scottish bankruptcy cases decline</title>
      <description>The number of people declared insolvent falls although company failures register a sharp increase.</description>

      <body>The number of people declared insolvent has fallen, according to official figures. Figures from the Accountant in Bankruptcy for the three months to the end of September show a 14.7% drop in personal insolvencies compared with the previous quarter. The number of company failures increased by more than 45% during the same period. However compared with a year ago business failures fell by 2.2%. A total of 3,411 individuals were declared insolvent between July and September this year - down from 4,000 in the previous three months. In contrast the Scottish government said its Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) which allows people to pay back what they owe over a longer period "continues to be seen as a viable alternative to bankruptcy". The number of approvals to the scheme was 1,170 during the quarter which the government said represented a four-fold increase since the equivalent quarter in 2009-10. The minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, Fergus Ewing, who has responsibility for personal insolvency and debt management in Scotland, said: "I welcome the reduction in Scottish personal insolvencies this quarter despite the current financial climate." He added: "The Scottish Government will continue to take action to provide the best possible debt solution services to help those people struggling with debt." Between July and September, there were 268 company failures compared with 184 the quarter before and 274 for the same three month period a year ago. Bryan Jackson, business restructuring partner with BDO, commented on the increase. He said: "Many companies have simply been existing for some time, barely maintaining solvency in the hope and expectation that an upturn in the market will be around the corner. "These firms, sometimes called 'zombie' businesses, will have been in the doldrums for several years and a slight change in circumstance, such as the loss of a key customer, could push them over the edge. He concluded: "In Scotland, I think we are likely to see more corporate failures in the months, and even years, ahead as the economy improves slowly and markets adjust to a different operating system. "It is clear that we will not be returning to the boom years of 2007 and the best business owners will know this and will adjust their activities accordingly." </body>

      <body>A fridge repair and servicing firm has gone into administration putting 600 jobs at risk across the UK. Leicester-based WR Refrigeration was served with a winding up petition by HMRC earlier this month. Administrators now say it faces "the real risk of imminent closure". Some 296 jobs are under threat in Leicester and 59 in East Kilbride. The firm also has sites in Ipswich, Weston Super Mare, Dartford, Leeds, Spalding, Cardiff, Swansea and Belfast. WR Refrigeration had been experiencing cash-flow and trading problems prior to the HMRC winding up petition. Administrators were called in after the firm was unable to secure additional funding. Joint administrator Eddie Williams, from PwC, said: "Over the last few weeks the directors, funders and other key stakeholders have been in extensive dialogue with regards to securing additional financial support for the business, particularly in light of the winding up petition. "Unfortunately, these discussions have not been successful and have led to our appointment as administrators. "The level of losses and funding requirements mean that the business may not be able to continue to trade and faces the real risk of imminent closure." </body>

      <body>A cameraman had an unexpected regular visitor while filming seals in Orkney for the BBC's The Great British Year television programme. Raymond Besant was filming a grey seal colony from a hide, but discovered it damaged. To his surprise, he found one of the seal pups hiding inside - and it kept returning. Mr Besant said: "He did have the good grace to get out when he saw me approaching." He explained: "I was filming over a period of three weeks and had a hide positioned at the top of the shore to avoid disturbing the seals too much. "But after two weeks of filming I noticed one morning that the hide looked damaged. "I thought it was just the bad weather but when I opened the back of the hide I found a young seal sleeping inside it." He went on: "The dilemma was how to get him out of the hide, I needed to get on with filming and I didn't want to get bitten. "I gently shook the hide and eventually he shuffled out. He had wrecked the hide, he was still moulting so there was fur everywhere and it smelled pretty bad, like wet dog. "I put some driftwood and things that were lying on the shore across the entrance to stop him coming in again as he had bent the hide poles over so far I couldn't close the entrance properly." "When I came down the next morning I was surprised to see his head poking out again. The wood was no barrier, he just bounced over the top of it. "So I took the driftwood away and decided that if he was going to go in I couldn't stop him. So for a week I arrived each morning to find him there." The wildlife cameraman added: "He was just a clever seal that had found somewhere warm and dry to stay." The footage appears in the autumn programme of The Great British Year which airs on BBC1 at 21:00 on Wednesday and is also available on the iPlayer. </body>

      <body>One of Scotland's most popular sitcoms is to make a comeback with a run of live shows at Glasgow's Hydro arena. Scottish comic actors Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill split their successful partnership when hit show Still Game finished its TV run in 2007. However, they have announced a reunion for a live stage show that will run for four nights at the 12,000 seat arena in September and October 2014. They say they are talking to the BBC about the show returning to TV screens. Meetings are planned for next week, the pair said. The four live shows will take place at the Hydro from 30 September to Friday 3 October next year. Tickets will go on sale on Friday. Forty four episodes of Still Game were broadcast over six series from 2002. In the show, Keirnan and Hemphill played Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade, two foul-mouthed pensioners spending their days disreputably in the fictional Glasgow housing scheme of Craiglang. They will be reunited with their friend Winston (Paul Riley), local busybody Isa (Jane McCarry), corner shop owner Navid (Sanjeev Kohli) and Boabby the barman at The Clansman (Gavin Mitchell) for their "exciting new venture". Kiernan and Hemphill, still only 51 and 43, are much younger than the characters they portray, despite a decade having passed since they first donned their flat caps and cardigans. The pair, who had previously had massive success with their sketch show Chewin the Fat, blamed the pressure of work for bringing their professional relationship and hit sitcom to an end. Keirnan told BBC Scotland: "We'd done 10 years together. The two of us had been together longer than the Beatles and we were frazzled." "It's been six long years of answering questions from people - Will you bring it back? Why is it not on telly anymore?" He said he and Hemphill had both separately looked at the 12,00-seat Hydro and been "taunted" by the possibilities of performing there. Keirnan said: "They built this place and we thought we'd be missing a trick if we did not have a stab at that big building. "This volume of place did not exist when we were playing before." Hemphill added: "We have never had a chance to bring Still Game fans together. We did Chewin the Fat at the Kings Theatre and it was a highlight for us." The characters of Jack and Victor were created in 1997 and appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe as well as touring theatres around the UK and in Canada, where Hemphill had spent a large part of his childhood. The characters were said to be based on Kiernan's uncle and Hemphill's grandfather. The original stage production saw the three friends stranded in Victor's flat, where they discuss a range of topics from death to sex. When Chewin' The Fat ended in 2002, Kiernan and Hemphill gave the irreverent oldies, who had been used in the sketch show, a new lease of life in their own sitcom. The show proved so popular that top names such as Robbie Coltrane, Lorraine Kelly, and John McCririck made appearances. However, the show ended at the top its game and there were report that the comedians had not spoken since their split. Keirnan said the pair had "bumped into each other" from time to time. "Our kids are at the same school and we live in the same area and it built gradually without us really noticing," says Keirnan. "Eventually you come to the conclusion, if so many people are asking for it, why are we not doing it?" Hemphill said the "reunion" was a new start for the characters and they hoped to do more with them after the shows. "It would be great to be doing these characters in 10 or 15 years time," Hemphill says. "There is no reason why we can't continue for years to come. "The show is unique in the sense that we are young guys growing into our characters." Keirnan agreed, saying: "It is a bit like Oor Wullie. He's eternally 10 and we are eternally 73, but with a little bit less make-up each year." </body>

      <body>A young Romanian man "rescued" from one of the country's state hospitals is visiting Scotland to thank the people who changed his life. Razvan Boc was nine years old when he was discovered by nurse Linda Barr. She had gone to work with children abandoned by Romanian society because of their perceived disabilities. Ms Barr went on to form Dumfries-based charity the RAP Foundation which runs an apartment in Bucharest where Mr Boc now lives with three friends. He has also found a job and saved his airfare to Scotland to meet - and thank - the foundation's supporters. Ms Barr said she immediately saw his potential. "I first met Razvan 23 years ago when I went out as a volunteer nurse and worked in an institution for mentally, physically and emotionally disabled youngsters," she said. "Razvan was in with a whole batch of youngsters who were classified by the system as being disabled and of no use to society. "But he actually shone out quite a bit and he demonstrated a real keenness and willingness to try and develop his own skills." Mr Boc, who has taught himself to speak English, said it was very special to come to Scotland and meet some of the people who had helped him. "For me this is very super," he said. "I visit many, many friends - it is wonderful." He said everyone had made him very welcome and he had taken the opportunity to thank them for their assistance. Ms Barr said it had not been straightforward for Mr Boc to make the trip. "For Razvan to come to Scotland was an incredibly hard journey for him to get his ticket," she said. "He had to go to many offices and really fight through a huge amount of bureaucracy and he challenged everybody that got in his way and fought really hard for his independent rights to actually hear his voice. "He succeeded - after a huge fight I might add." She said she would never have thought it possible he could make such a journey when she first met him many years ago. "Razvan has demonstrated skills and qualities that are profound," she said. "He is an ambassador for what can be achieved by lots of people in Romanian orphanages." </body>

      <body>An independent investigation has made three recommendations to Police Scotland for the way they handle missing person inquiries. It follows an incident where a man with mental health issues fell seven floors from a block of flats in Leith shortly after officers had taken him home. They had found him wandering several miles away in the Torphin Bank area. The man, 39, sustained serious injuries in the incident last June, and is still in hospital. He fell from the block of flats 90 minutes after he had been returned to his home with police. Prof John McNeill, the independent Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, said in the previous four days officers had what is described as "direct and indirect" contact with the man, who had a history of psychiatric illness. However, that information had not been passed to officers who found the man and who decided he was simply lost and drove him home. Prof McNeill has called for a review of the way missing person inquiries are handled, in particular how information held by police systems is passed to operational officers to assist their decision making. Prof McNeill said: "It is essential that information held in police systems and otherwise available to police staff is accurately recorded and provided to front line officers when attending calls. This is particularly relevant in the response to incident reports concerning vulnerable persons. "Furthermore, leaving a person who presented with mental health issues alone at their home, in the absence of an appropriate adult to care for their welfare, does not constitute leaving them in a place of safety." </body>

      <body>Late-night shoppers will be able to park their cars for free in Edinburgh city centre in the run up to Christmas. Edinburgh City Council is again waiving parking charges from 17:00 between 2 and 28 December in a bid to attract shoppers to Princes Street. Alive after Five also encourages shops in the area to remain open until 19:00 during the festive period. It is the second year running that the scheme has been in place leading up to Christmas. Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city Council's transport convener, said: "The Christmas shopping period is the busiest time of the year for retailers and we want to encourage facilities to remain open for longer to make the most of this. "We have agreed with Marketing Edinburgh and Essential Edinburgh to continue with free evening parking this year as part of Alive after Five as it is popular with shoppers at Christmas and those wanting to take advantage of some of the fantastic new attractions that make up this year's Edinburgh's Christmas. "There are no longer road closures in the city centre due to tram works, which is another great bonus." </body>

      <body>Organisers of the new Edinburgh's winter season have announced a programme of free events in the capital to celebrate St Andrew's Day. Scottish performers will take part throughout the afternoon and evening of Saturday 30 November in Edinburgh's Grassmarket. Breabach, Dougie MacLean, Louis Abbott and Blazin' Fiddles will all feature at the event. There will also be ceilidh events and workshops. Children can join dance workshops, write their own ceilidh tune, or hear some Scottish stories of myth and magic by the Scottish Storytelling Centre. There will be an outdoor ceilidh with the Cask Strength Ceilidh Band and the Adam Sutherland Band. There will also be a record-breaking attempt of a giant Strip the Willow as well as a Silent Ceilidh. The programme runs from 14:00 to 22.00 and all events are free. Culture secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Scotland's winter festivals bring people together to celebrate the very best of our culture, creativity and hospitality. "Not only do they make a significant contribution to our economy, but they bring warmth, excitement and sparkle to our cold, dark winter nights, and demonstrate our ability to celebrate our rich culture year-round. "The packed programme of free events around St Andrew's Day in Edinburgh's Grassmarket is the perfect way for the city to kick off the celebrations." Pete Irvine, the director of Unique Events, said: "It's the first time that we have celebrated St Andrew's Day in this way in Edinburgh, and a great start to the city's Christmas and Hogmanay programme of events, all part of Scotland's Winter Festivals."

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <title>Kayal hopes for Celtic reinforcements</title>
      <description>Beram Kayal hopes players return from injury and suspension for Celtic before they face Ajax in Amsterdam.</description>

      <body>Beram Kayal is hoping Scott Brown and Kris Commons can play in the return game against Ajax despite scoring against the Dutch in their absence. Kayal's goal in the Champions League win was his first since May 2011. "I am so happy to score, but the important thing is the three points," said Kayal, given his start through Commons' injury and Brown's suspension. "I hope a few come back into the squad. We missed Scott and Kris. Brown is a great captain and Commons is magic." Celtic leapfrogged Ajax into third place in Group H, two points behind AC Milan, and next travel to Amsterdam Arena on 6 November. Commons could still be an injury doubt by then, while Brown will be suspended again unless Celtic win an appeal against his three-match ban. "I'm just back after four weeks out with a groin injury, but hopefully I can stay fit now and try to help the team as much as I can," added Kayal. "I'm so happy to be back and, when the gaffer asks me to do a job, I was glad to do it." Kayal thinks Celtic still have a chance of overtaking AC Milan to make the last 16 for a second year running. "In the last two games against Barcelona and AC Milan, we didn't get the points, but we are working hard as a team and it's a great win for us," said the Israel international. "We needed these three points, our first after three games, but the dream is still there. "We are just looking step-by-step, but it now gives us a good chance." James Forrest's penalty in first-half stoppage time put Celtic ahead against Frank de Boer's Amsterdam outfit before Kayal slotted home a second eight minutes into the second half with the help of a deflection. Forrest was made to wait as Ajax contested the penalty decision after Anthony Stokes was felled by Stefano Denswil, but the winger said he refused to be disturbed. "They were trying a wee bit of mind games, but that just made me concentrate more," the Scotland international told BBC Scotland. "I was a wee bit nervous, but it was good nerves and I was confident I was going to score. "That's only my second penalty for the first team, but I'm always happy to take them." The versatile Charlie Mulgrew said Celtic should now fear nobody in the competition but stressed: "It's just three points at home - we are not getting carried away." Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster was beaten by Lasse Schone's stoppage-time consolation goal but played down several fine saves before Kayal extended the home side's lead. "I made a few saves, but that's what I'm there to do and it's nice to make them," said the Englishman. "We have been unlucky in the first two games. We maybe had a little more luck, but we were clinical in front of goal, took our chances and we got the three points we deserved. "It'll be a different game away from home - but, if we play the way we did against Ajax and in Milan, we can go and pick up a result." </body>

      <title>Lennon buoyed by first group win</title>
      <description>Neil Lennon believes Celtic can qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League following the 2-1 defeat of Ajax.</description>

      <body>Celtic manager Neil Lennon believes qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League is still within reach after defeating Ajax 2-1 in Glasgow. A James Forrest penalty and Beram Kayal's second-half strike sealed a crucial win for Celtic in the first of a double-header against the Dutch side. "It leaves us in a very good position," said Lennon. "We'll have to get a result in Amsterdam if we can. "That's going to be difficult, but it's not beyond us." A late Lasse Schone strike from distance in the fourth minute of added time handed the Dutch a small consolation, but the win kick-started Celtic's Champions League campaign after losing their opening two matches against Barcelona and AC Milan. It lifts Lennon's men into third place in Group H with three points while Ajax drop to the foot of the table with only one. Leaders Barca are on seven points following their draw with Milan. The Scottish champions travel to Amsterdam in two weeks and Lennon insists they have enough confidence to take something from the game. "We're only two behind Milan now," said Lennon. "Every game is different, you have to take it on its merits. "Ajax at home in Amsterdam are a formidable side, you can see they had a lot of possession tonight. "They passed and moved the ball well, but I thought we coped with the majority of stuff they threw at us. "Second half, we broke very well and we could have seen the game out a bit more comfortably for my liking. "The group is wide open and it was a massive win in the context of the group." Lennon praised the composure of Forrest to slot home the opener from the penalty spot on the stroke of half-time after Anthony Stokes had been felled in the penalty area by Stefano Denswil. "He keeps telling me he's never missed a penalty," said Lennon. "So this morning we had a chat about it and he said he would step up and take it. "Obviously Kris Commons was out, but he kept his cool because there was gamesmanship going on with the keeper. "It set us up very nicely for the second half. "You've got to give huge credit to the players. This is our 19th competitive game so far - that's half our season - the squad is stretched with injury, players suspended, but there was heroic effort tonight and hopefully we'll get some back for the game in Amsterdam. "We can get results away from home now but we have to play very well in Amsterdam to get something out of the game. I feel we're capable of doing that. "If we had got a point tonight, it wouldn't have been the end of the world, but we got the win, so it's wide open again." Ajax manager Frank de Boer remains confident his side can still get third place in the group. "Celtic didn't create anything although they scored twice, once with a penalty," he said. "We dominated the game but only scored once and should have equalised before they got their second. "It is going to be very hard for us to get second place but I have confidence in the third place. "We have one point and if we win at home we will be one point ahead of Celtic." </body>

      <body>A badger was snared and beaten to death and then left on a footpath in Inverness, the Scottish SPCA has said. The animal welfare charity said the badger was found by two women on a footpath in the Inshes area of the city on 30 September. A post mortem examination has shown that it was snared using baler twine and killed with a heavy blow to the head with a blunt instrument. The SSPCA said the animal was killed illegally. Gill MacGregor, a senior inspector at the charity, has appealed for help from the public in finding out who set the snare. She said: "This is a very unusual incident as it appears that the badger was deliberately killed and then placed on what is a very busy footpath, possibly with the intention of it being discovered. "We have been advised there are no known badger setts in the area so this rules out the possibility that the badger crawled there or was killed at the location where it was found." Ms MacGregor added: "The injuries the badger sustained were horrendous and this was an incredibly cruel act." </body>

      <body>Two men have been jailed and another given a community sentence following a nine-hour siege at an Inverness flat. Alexander Stewart, 28, and Lee Mullen, 39, admitted threatening police, brandishing knives and other weapons at them while claiming to be in possession of firearms and having four hostages. Stewart was jailed for 27 months and Mullen ordered to carry out 300 hours of community work. Lee Dyce was jailed for 71 weeks for his part in the siege in Raigmore. He admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner, gesticulating towards police, brandishing weapons at them and refusing to leave the flat. He was on three bail orders at the time. He is currently serving nine months in prison and his sentence takes into account his time on remand since 10 June. Stewart, a father-of three from Inverness, also admitted racially abusing a police officer and a breach of bail. Inverness Sheriff Court heard how armed police were among 16 officers who sealed off the estate on 9 June. Fiscal depute Kelly Mitchell told the court that police had been called to the flat at about 22:00 after neighbours complained about music being played too loudly. Stewart refused the police entry to the flat, shouted racial abuse to a sergeant and claimed he had a knife. Ms Mitchell said Stewart told police: "This is war. You will be here all day and night. I have four hostages. If you come in, I will kill them." Stewart then sent his mother a text saying that his home was surrounded by armed police and he would be taken out in a body bag. Ms Mitchell said: "Dyce was then seen by police to come to the window holding a knife and another implement. "Mullen also came to the window brandishing a knife and a baton which he held like shooting a gun." She added: "About 2.40am, a man was heard to shout 'Don't kill me Alexander', before Mullen jumped out of the window and was arrested. "Stewart and Dyce eventually came out of the property at 6.40am. Sixteen police officers and a dog unit were involved in the incident." Stewart's defence lawyer Rory Gowans said what had started as a noise complaint escalated when the police arrived. He said: "Rather than open the door, he turned up the music and barricaded them in." "They had all been drinking for most of the day." Dyce's solicitor Marc Dickson said the incident was not planned and had taken "a life of its own". Mullen's agent, Neil Wilson, said his client was "foolish" to become involved but had eventually come to his senses and surrendered. Sheriff Margaret Neilson told Stewart and Dyce they had "appalling records." She added: "This was a serious incident which caused considerable fear and alarm to the community, lasted a long time and involved considerable police resources." </body>

      <body>Plans for a new secondary school in Aberdeen to replace Torry Academy and Kincorth Academy are set to proceed. It follows the Scottish government's decision not to call in the closure plans for further investigation. Aberdeen City Council's proposal is to build a new replacement £30m school on the Bobby Calder Park site. The council's education, culture and sport convener Jenny Laing said: "We need a school that is fit for purpose in the 21st century." The aim is for the new school - for up to 1,450 pupils - to open in the school session 2016-17. A Scottish government spokesman confirmed: "Local authorities are responsible for decisions on the school estate within their area and Scottish ministers may only call in a school closure decision for investigation if there is evidence to suggest a failing of an authority's statutory obligations. "In respect of this decision no such evidence was found. "Ministers are grateful to those who made representations on the issue and have sought assurances from the council that there will be further engagement with interested parties to work through the concerns that have been raised." </body>

Scottish Borders Council has agreed to provide salt bins to community councils who have signed up for the authority's Resilient Communities Initiative. Cuts to the region's "primary network" led to concerns in some rural areas. Councillor Gordon Edgar said the grit bin strategy could pay off for areas willing to get involved. "It is part of the resilience plan, if you like, that communities can become involved and take part in their own safety," he explained. "The provision of equipment is from the council and within their resilience plan they will have set up a procedure so they can use the equipment to their best benefit.

The holiday village houses dozens of caravans but nobody was injured in the incident. The owners have submitted proposals to Dumfries and Galloway Council to build replacement facilities. The plans include provision for a swimming pool, dance floor, lounge and bar areas. </body>

      <description>Callum Flood, of Dundee, is fined £1,500 after being caught with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone.</description>

      <body>A man who was caught by police with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone outside a party at a friend's house as been fined £1,500. Callum Flood, 24, from Dundee, bought the gun to play practical jokes on friends. At a previous hearing he had pled guilty to illegally possessing the firearm in May 2011. At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Brodie made the decision not to impose a custodial sentence. Under the Firearms Act, the offence carries a minimum of a five year prison sentence, as laid down by Parliament - unless exceptional circumstances are established. Lord Brodie decided to spare him prison because he was convinced that there were exceptional circumstances in the case. The court heard how Flood had been detained by police after they were called to a house in Dundee following an altercation. Flood was restrained and handcuffed and an officer asked him if he had anything which could cause harm, to which he replied: "No". He was searched and an item that appeared to be a mobile phone was found in a pocket of his jeans, but an onlooker called out that it was a taser. At an earlier hearing, Lord Brodie said: "The policy here is that people are to be deterred from possessing firearms or any weapon which can be regarded as a firearm. "In the current case I have come to the conclusion that exceptional circumstances do exist. "In particular I have had regard to the fact that this was a non lethal weapon. It is a harmful weapon but the harm it can achieve is limited. "Your intention which I accept, was to use it as a means of carrying out practical jokes and indeed you had tested it already on yourself." Lord Brodie said he also accepted that Flood did not understand that possessing the weapon was unlawful. He added: "On the evidence before me it would appear the period you possessed it was short." He said he took into account that there was no device for recharging the electric shock weapon and that Flood said he did not intend to use it for criminal purposes." The judge said he would defer sentence on Flood for a year. Flood, who had been drinking, had been at a party at a friend's house before heading to his girlfriend's home had said: "I thought it was a toy. I just bought it from a friend as I was leaving the party. I thought it would be a good practical joke." His defence solicitor advocate Iain Paterson urged Lord Brodie not to jail his client. Lord Brodie agreed and ordered the fine to be paid within the year. </body>

      <body>Police investigating an attempted robbery at a Dundee newsagent are to revisit the scene. A teenager threatened a 67-year-old shop assistant with a weapon and demanded money in the Hilltown area of the city last Wednesday at about 16:45. The suspect, who is aged about 16 or 17, 5ft tall, of medium build and with short dirty blonde hair, ran off after she refused to hand over any cash. Officers want to speak to the occupants of two cars in the area at the time. One was a purple or red Ford Focus seen at about 15:00, and the other was a silver car, possibly an older-style Honda Civic or Nissan Almera, which was seen at about 16:35. Police have carried out a review of CCTV and made door-to-door inquiries as part of the investigation. They urged anyone who was in the area at the time, who might have information about the robbery, to contact them. </body>

      <title>Call to review roof space loophole</title>
      <description>An MSP has written to the housing minister about a legal loophole which allows landlords of top-floor flats to build into communal roof space.</description>

      <body>An MSP has called on the government to review a legal loophole which allows landlords of top-floor flats to build into communal roof space. Some property developers have been converting tenements flats into larger properties for rent in Edinburgh in a bid to reap financial rewards. Although roof repairs are shared by all residents in a block, top-floor flat owners are able to install windows. Alison Johnstone said there was a need to raise awareness of the issue. The Green MSP told BBC Scotland that greater protection for tenement residents was needed. She said: "We have heard of a couple of cases in Edinburgh where the top floor flat, from a one bedroom flat is being developed to a four bedroom flat and neighbours have had no warning at all, which is simply not good enough. "That just makes you feel really disempowered and when constituents have gone to planning and to building regulators they have been told there is nothing they can do. "I think it is worth the government having a look at the legislation in this area, to make sure that all those who live in tenements enjoy the full protection and understand exactly what can happen in that space." A top floor flat in Dalry was turned into a three bedroom property after Glasgow-based developer James Logan of Solenglen Ltd, who was unavailable for comment, knocked through into the communal attic and roof. The loft space at Murieston Terrace was fitted out with two bedrooms and a bathroom, and builders cut through the roof to install five windows. The landlord has 11 other large, shared flats in the area. HMOs (house in multiple occupation) can earn landlords in excess of £1,250 a month in rent. Edinburgh City Council does not require landlords to have planning permission to create an HMO flat out of a smaller property and communal roof space. However, the other owners in the tenement block are still liable to pay an equal share of the costs of maintaining the roof. Jim and Betty Russell have lived on the stair at Murieston Terrace for 47 years, said: "Until this happened everyone in our stair thought they had a joint share in the attic space and roof. "In all our time here neighbours have paid equal shares of repair costs and maintenance. "We don't know where we stand now and how can it be fair that one owner can ride rough shod doing whatever he wants for his own benefit and profit, without even having the courtesy to let neighbours know what is intended. "We find it incredible that a building warrant can be provided without checks occurring to determine ownership or that the agreement of other owners has been provided." An Edinburgh City Council spokeswoman said: "Dispute of land ownership is a civil matter and the council has no powers to get involved." </body>

      <body>Further talks are to take place after members of Scotland's largest teaching union rejected planned changes to working conditions. EIS members voted against the offer by a margin of almost 3-2. At a meeting between the union and employers all sides agreed to consider their positions and hold more discussions soon. The proposed changes were designed to make teachers' conditions of employment more flexible. For instance a teacher might be expected to spend two hours more with students one week but do two hours less the next to balance this out. Changes were also proposed to the list of things which are, and are not, the responsibility of teachers. The EIS had anticipated that the current pay offer for teachers would be withdrawn if the changes to conditions were rejected. This has not yet happened. A spokesman for council umbrella body Cosla said: "Our position has not changed. The deal as presented to the teachers' unions remains on the table. "All three sides - the unions, Scottish government and Cosla have agreed to meet again in November." The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers is made up of representatives of teachers' unions, councils and the Scottish government. The teachers' side stated that teachers were prepared to accept the two year pay deal, changes to pay and arrangements for short term supply teachers and to participate in a working group to consider supply teacher availability. But they said they were not prepared to conclude agreement on the proposed changes to the duties, working hours and working week of teachers. </body>

      <description>Scotland's textile industry sets new growth goals after exceeding targets it had originally hoped to reach in seven years' time.</description>

      <body>Scotland's textile industry has set new growth goals after exceeding targets it had originally hoped to reach in seven years' time. Finance Secretary John Swinney made the announcement during a summit in the Scottish Borders. A 2011 Textiles Industry Strategy aimed to increase turnover to £846m by 2020 but it now stands at £950m. It has prompted a revised target for taking turnover to between £1.2bn and £1.5bn by 2020. Mr Swinney said: "The textile industry has made and continues to make a massive contribution to the economy. "Today's figures show the huge demand the sector has in markets across the world and the success of the industry. "The Scottish government and its agencies are committed to helping the sector make the most of the estimated £81bn global market." He also announced that £120,000 via Skills Development Scotland (SDS) has been awarded to the Scottish Textiles and Leather Association. It will be used for a range of initiatives including introducing a Certificate of Work Readiness for 16 to 22-year-olds seeking their first experience of work in textiles. David Martin of SDS said: "This funding will help the Scottish textiles industry develop and will also ensure there's an increase in opportunities for young people and new entrants looking to join the industry. "There's huge potential for the textiles industry to expand in Scotland. "SDS is delighted to be playing a part in that growth by working in partnership to ensure the skills are in place for future development." Head of textiles at Scottish Enterprise, Cathy Black, said the rise in turnover was testament to the "ambitious and innovative" nature of textile companies. "In 2013 alone, we have supported over 40 companies to participate in leading international events such as Chic in China, Decorex in London and, in November, six rail interior companies will visit Cologne to exhibit at the Railway Interior Expo," she said. "It's opportunities like these as well as the sector's strong heritage and world-class reputation in design and excellence, that help to support the sector's ambitious target to increase exports by 50% by 2017 and contribute to its wider economic growth. "Working together with our partners and stakeholders we are committed to helping grow this important sector to Scotland." </body>

      <body>The life insurance and pensions firm, Aegon UK, has had its financial strength rating downgraded from a B+ to a B. The ratings agency and actuarial firm, AKG, also raised questions over the group's commitment to the UK market. The Dutch-owned firm says AKG's report contains inaccuracies but declined to say what they were. Aegon, which has its UK base in Edinburgh, reported an £11m loss for the second quarter of 2013. The firm has reduced its workforce as part of major restructuring which cost Aegon £27m in the second quarter. It has closed sales offices in Glasgow, London, Guildford, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol. An Aegon spokesman said: "We consider this report to be inaccurate and we do not believe the interpretation given on publicly available data truly reflects the position of Aegon UK. "We have been speaking to AKG since August and have pointed out some of these inaccuracies. We look forward to this open dialogue continuing." He added: "Aegon in the UK is part of the Aegon NV group - one of the world's largest and strongest insurance companies." It is rated A- by Standard and Poors, A3 by Moodys and A by Fitch. </body>

      <title>Argos and Homebase in sales rise</title>
      <description>The owner of the Argos and Homebase retail chains says turnaround plans are on track, with both divisions reporting a rise in sales.</description>

      <body>The owner of the Argos and Homebase retail chains has said its turnaround plans are on track with both divisions reporting a rise in sales. Home Retail Group said total sales in the six months to 31 August rose 3% to £2.59bn, with Argos up 2.3% and Homebase 5.9% higher. Pre-tax profits fell to £14.2m from a re-stated £46.7m last year. But after stripping out one-off items, the underlying profit was up 53% to £27.4m. After seeing profits decline for five years in a row, Home Retail Group is updating its Homebase stores and seeking to revamp Argos by increasing sales through its website. The firm said that total internet sales now accounted for 43% of Argos' total sales, with sales generated through smartphones and tablets representing 16% of sales. Last month, Argos announced a tie-up with eBay, whereby shoppers will be able to order selected goods from eBay and pick them up from an Argos store. Chief executive Terry Duddy said: "Argos and Homebase are making good progress with their investment plans, and remain on track to deliver their long term strategic objectives." However, he added that the general retail climate remained tough. "As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect consumer spending will remain subdued, and whilst some macroeconomic indicators are improving, these have not yet led to an increase in household disposable income." Mr Duddy, who is stepping down as Home Retail Group chief by next July after 15 years at the helm, said the group was in "excellent shape" in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period. Argos's underlying operating profits jumped £7.7m in the six months, up from £3.3m last year, with the company saying there had been particularly strong demand for tablet computers. Argos recently followed Tesco in announcing the launch of its own-brand tablet, called MyTablet, which will be on sale for less than £100 as part of its Christmas product range. Home Retail Group also said there had been a reversal in the fortunes at its Homebase DIY chain. A surge in demand for garden furniture in the summer heatwave helped Homebase's like-for-like sales rise 5.9%, marking the strongest growth since it was bought by Home Retail Group in 2002. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <body>St Johnstone have signed Bosnia-Herzegovina defender Sanel Jahic until the first week in January. The 31-year-old has been training with the club for 10 days and will provide cover for the injured Steven Anderson. And his arrival coincides with Frazer Wright receiving an extended suspension of three Premiership games. Wright has been given an extra two-match ban for comments made to the fourth official following his red card in Saturday's defeat at St Mirren. The defender's remarks were deemed sufficient for a second red card to be issued. Jahic, who has 31 caps for World Cup-bound Bosnia, was released by Turkish club Karabukspor in the summer, having previously played for Sochaux, Željezničar, Las Palmas, Mérida, Aris Thessaloniki, AEK Athens and APOEL Nicosia. Fellow centre-back Anderson is recovering from a dislocated thumb and is likely to be out until the turn of the year. </body>

      <body>Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney is to undergo hip surgery that will keep him out for a minimum of three months. He will miss Scotland's friendlies against the United States and Norway in November, as well as a large portion of Wigan's Championship campaign. The 30-year-old, who has not played since 14 September, has been struggling with the problem since pre-season. "He had it when we came into the club over the summer - an existing hip injury," said Latics boss Owen Coyle. "To be fair to Shaun, he tried to play through that, which we thought might be manageable for the season. "But when he was away with Scotland he picked up a back injury that had actually led from the existing hip injury, so will now go in for that hip operation." When asked when Maloney would be fit to return, Coyle added: "If I knew it was going to be three, four or five months, then I could tell you. We won't know that until the surgeon opens him up and sees the extent of the damage. "As it is, I think it's certainly fair to say it will be a minimum of three months, and obviously there is a chance it could be longer than that." Maloney, who was part of the Wigan squad that won the FA Cup and were relegated from the Premier League last season, has scored three times in six club appearances this term. Wigan host Russian side Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday and will be looking to protect their unbeaten record in Group D, having taken four points from their first two matches. </body>

      <description>Celtic can complete a Champions League double against Ajax, says former Hoops winger Regi Blinker.</description>

      <body>Former Celtic winger Regi Blinker says the Glasgow side can complete the double over Ajax when they play their Champions League return in Amsterdam. Celtic gathered their first points in Group H with a 2-1 win in Glasgow and play in the Netherlands on 6 November. Tuesday's win means Celtic lie third behind Barcelona and AC Milan in the race for two qualification places. "I can see them beating Ajax and then the two other games, they are unpredictable," said Blinker. After travelling to Amsterdam, Celtic will host AC Milan, who sit second, two points ahead of the Scottish champions, after their 1-1 draw with Barcelona in Italy before travelling to Spain for their final group game. Ajax coach Frank de Boer thought his side, who sit bottom with only one point from three games, would struggle to reach the last 16 but felt they could still qualify for the Europa League by finishing third. However, he thought his young team were unlucky at Celtic Park having dominated possession and missed several good chances. Blinker accepted that most in his homeland appeared to agree with that assessment but told BBC Scotland: "The pundits were saying after it that Ajax were playing better football, but my opinion is that better football won't get you results every time. "I saw a reasonably good Ajax team who were passing the ball around and playing like a Dutch team should play and then I saw a real, effective Celtic team that scored in two crucial moments. "I saw the the way Celtic played and I liked that better - there was a longer ball played up front, and then they could run there with James Forrest and Georgios Samaras - because it was more effective." Blinker, who played for Sheffield Wednesday and Celtic after 10 years with Feyenoord, picked out compatriot Virgil van Dijk for special praise. "Celtic are much more aggressive physically and especially van Dijk impressed me in the game," the 44-year-old said of the central defender who joined Celtic from Groningen this summer. </body>

One contractor at the site said: "A lot of subbies will lose their jobs now because Ineos will not take a pension cut."

      <body>Alex Salmond has said he is not prepared to accept the closure of part of the Grangemouth petrochemical and refinery plant. The first minister told BBC Scotland: "I am not accepting that Grangemouth is going to close. I can't accept that because it is too important." Workers at the site had earlier been told by site owners Ineos that the petrochemical plant will close. Talks are ongoing over the future of the refinery. </body>

      <body>The Grangemouth unions have been "conned and set-up" said the Labour MP who serves the area around the petrochemical plant which is set is to close. Ineos made the announcement following a meeting with the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery. Michael Connarty said it was "quite clear this company prepared for this conflict quite well" when he spoke to Andrew Neil on BBC's Daily Politics soon after the closure was announced. But the Linlithgow and East Falkirk MP reckoned there was a "serious prospect" of a potential buyer, although he could not give a name. He said the plant may not be "loss making in the long term", but said the company wanted to "beat the union down".

      <body>Owners Ineos have announced that the petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close. The neighbouring refinery will remain open. About 800 people are directly employed by the petrochemical plant, with more employed as sub-contractors. What's the problem with the petro-chemical plant at Grangemouth? Grangemouth's petro-chemical plant has used the by-products from refining oil across the road at the refinery. That's been used to manufacture a wide range of products, including plastics and pharmaceuticals. The oil coming down the pipeline from the Forties network in the North Sea has less of the ethane content, meaning the petro-chemical plant has been operating at less than 60% of capacity. To source new gas 'feedstock', Ineos planned to import it from the US, where the shale gas boom has driven down prices. It said earlier this month that its 'survival plan' would require more than £300m of Ineos investment to re-equip the Forth Valley plant. The firm also said it would require government loan guarantees and big cuts in costs, primarily the pay and pensions of the refinery and petro-chemical plants' joint workforce of 1,370. Without that agreement, it said the petro-chemical plant would close by 2017. How has this industrial dispute led to closure? Unite, the trade union, started industrial action 16 days ago over a separate dispute involving alleged victimisation. It then gave notice of a 48-hour strike from Sunday to Tuesday. Management responded by shutting down the plant. There were talks last week at arbitration service Acas. They broke down, but the union withdrew its strike threat. Ineos moved swiftly to require staff to accept changes to their contracts. The union urged members not to accept but to demand a return to negotiations. Two-thirds of Unite members took that advice, or half of the total workforce. Ineos said on Wednesday morning that the union response led it to close the plant, much faster than it had previously indicated. Liquidators are to be appointed within a week. Could it have a future? There may still be value to the assets, though Ineos recently reduced its asset valuation from nearly £400m to zero, saying there is no realistic prospect of future profit. A liquidator could seek a buyer. What that buyer would require is necessary funds for re-equipping it. It would have to source the feedstock, probably from the USA. If Ineos figures are correct, it would also require a lower cost base, so similar problems of reduced pay and pensions could arise, without industrial relations tensions being resolved. Could it be nationalised? The Scottish government has become involved in trying to find a buyer for Grangemouth, ahead of the decision on petro-chemical closure. It hasn't ruled out the possibility of taking over the plant itself. Neither ministers nor the civil service have expertise in running a complex petro-chemical plant, and would have to appoint an operator, and pay for it. It would also have to find funds for investment, when its capital budget is already severely squeezed. If Ineos's figures are correct, the Scottish government would face losses for the foreseeable future. It would also have to address the industrial relations challenge. What future for the refinery? The finances of the neighbouring refinery have been helped by selling feedstock to the petro-chemical plant. Without that outlet for its by-product, it will have to flare off excess gas, losing income and raising issues about excessive emissions. It could seek to ship out its by-products, but transportation would raise costs, and would be in competition with American shipments. On them, Ineos says gas is available at quarter of the European price. Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of Ineos, has warned that if the petro-chemical plant closes, then it is likely to lead to the demise of the refinery as well. The refinery market is suffering from significant global over-capacity, with more new refineries being built in the Middle East and Asia. They are more efficient and better suited to modern demand patterns for diesel instead of the high petrol output for which older European refineries were designed. There have been several recent refinery closures across Europe, where owners have been unable to find buyers. The big oil producers have been exiting the market for both refining and petro-chemicals over recent years, because they get better return on their capital from focussing on upstream exploration and production. So the buyers for assets such as Grangemouth are more likely to be strategic investors, taking the long view. One of them could be PetroChina, which has 49.9% ownership of the refinery. (It's pointing out that the majority lies with Ineos, and therefore the decision on its future lies there too.) However, state-controlled PetroChina has made colossal losses on its refining in recent years, and its management are focussed on handling a major corruption scandal in China. </body>

      <description>Will reporter Huw Williams' cake rise to the occasion?</description>

      <body>Great British Bake Off 2013 comes to an end tonight. My editors wanted to mark the occasion. "Get Huw to make a cake," someone said. If only they'd known how much terror that apparently simple idea was to unleash. Think really good home baking and you think of the Scottish Women's Rural Institute (the equivalent of the WI, if you're south of the border). The WRI? Terrifying? Well, yes. Truly. I ended up at the Royal Deeside home of Frances Johnstone - Ballater's answer to Mary Berry. She's an award-winning baker. She's judged more cake competitions than you've had hot dinners. Prince Charles has praised her Clootie Dumpling. And she's a huge fan of the tv series. She's warm. Charming. Friendly. All of those things, combined with a steely expertise. You get the sense that she could sniff out a soggy bottom faster than Paul Hollywood. And she's not going to be impressed with an uneven bake. Or any stray bits of egg shell that make it into the cake mixture. She's got a recipe ready for me when I arrive at her house. The classic of home baking. An apparently simple Victoria Sandwich. Named, apparently, because the eponymous monarch - who often stayed up the road at her beloved Balmoral - was partial to a slice with her afternoon tea. Luckily Frances has decided we're going for the all-in-one method. Not the much more difficult traditional method, with the ever-present risk it'll curdle when you mix in the eggs. So I grease and line the tins with baking parchment. Sieve eight ounces of self-raising flour into a big brown bowl. Add eight ounces of caster sugar. Chop up eight ounces of butter. Pour in four eggs, and add two tea spoons of baking powder. I'm getting ready to mix it all together. But Frances intervenes. The recipe was written by her heroine, Mary Berry. But. Mary Berry got it ever so slightly wrong, apparently. "I always like to add a pinch of salt to all my recipes," Frances explains. And there's no mention of vanilla essence, either. But again that will make it better. So, in it goes. As I turn on the hand mixer, flour goes everywhere. Frances winces, slightly. But doesn't say anything. I'm talking too much. Interviewing Frances for a report on BBC radio's "Good Morning Scotland" programme. Trying to understand the secret of a really successful cake. So I forget to take a note of the time. The recipe says beat the mixture for two minutes. I have no idea how long I actually mixed it for. Then it's time to divide the batter between my two prepared tins. I roughly spoon the mix into two halves, and get ready to smooth it down. But Frances wants me to weigh the tins. to make sure the division is truly accurate. By pure fluke both tins weigh exactly the same. Frances beams. By mistake I've done something exactly right. Then it's into the pre-heated oven. For 25 minutes. Just time for Frances to spell out what a Victoria Sandwich should be like. "Well risen. Nice colour. Good texture. Good taste. And, obviously, very light." I giggle nervously, as the kitchen fills with the smell of cooking cakes. And peer through the glass of the oven as they seem - unbelievably - actually to be rising. They're taken out. Removed for their tins. Left to cool on wire racks. So, what does Frances think? "They're very even. Not too bad." So, not prize winners then? "It would depend what else was entered, doesn't it?" Frances laughs. Then, the crucial taste test. And again her verdict is carefully calibrated. They are, she pronounces, "very edible". Not, you'll note, very delicious. But at least very edible. So what went wrong? "I thought they might have risen a wee bit more. I wonder if you did enough beating. I'm not too sure on that." So when the time comes to serve my cake to the programme's presenters I decide to resort to a distraction technique. Slavering the whole thing with fresh whipped cream. Really good jam. And fresh raspberries. All to draw attention away from the actual sponges themselves. So, terrifying? Yes. But with a lot of laughter. And a "very edible" cake at the end of it. Next time, though, I'm going to suggest Frances does the baking. While I watch. And learn. </body>

      <description>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England.</description>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>TB challenge over 'missing' millions</title>
      <description>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization says.</description>

      <body>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization has said. Finding these missed cases is one of the biggest challenges in TB care and control, the WHO's report says. Twelve countries including India, South Africa and Bangladesh account for the majority of undiagnosed individuals. But the WHO says the target to halve the number of TB deaths by 2015 is still within reach. Global TB programme director Dr Mario Raviglione said 56 million people had been cured and 22 million lives had been saved in the past 15 years and half of the highest-burden countries were on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals targets, but there remained a number of major challenges. "The two major challenges we identified are that of detecting in the system what we call the missed cases," he told the BBC. " There are about three million people that we estimate had TB and that are not officially in the system, that are not reported. "Some of them may actually be never detected, some of them are in fact hidden in the private sector, in the non-state sector, that does not notify the cases. "So that is I think one of the biggest challenges we have to face and there are opportunities there because we know where these cases may be." The WHO says TB testing services need to be urgently improved in many countries, with help from non-governmental organisations NGOs and volunteers. And in others, particularly Asian countries, more needs to be done to ensure figures on TB are compiled and reported centrally. The other major challenge highlighted is drug-resistant TB. The WHO estimates that 450,000 people became ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 2012. China, India and Russia have the highest rates. But the report adds that by 2012, deaths from TB had been reduced by 45% since 1990, meaning the target of a 50% reduction by 2015 is within reach. Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres' (MSF) infectious disease specialist Dr Philipp du Cros said: "Three in four people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are still not diagnosed, and 17,000 of those diagnosed in 2012 did not even start treatment." He said: "These shocking figures are an indictment of the global failure to tackle drug-resistant tuberculosis head on. People are paying for this failure with their lives." Dr Du Cros added: "Unless we take urgent action, we will continue to see an increase in harder-to-treat drug resistant strains of TB." He said more research was needed to make treatments for TB shorter, more effective and less damaging for patients. "An extra $2bn was needed to plug a funding gap in the treatment of TB, he added. </body>

      <body>The risk from saturated fat in foods such as butter, cakes and fatty meat is being overstated and demonised, according to a cardiologist. Dr Aseem Malhotra said there was too much focus on the fat with other factors such as sugar often overlooked. It is time to "bust the myth of the role of saturated fat in heart disease", he writes in an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal. But the British Heart Foundation said there was conflicting evidence. It added reducing cholesterol through drugs or other means does lower heart risk. Studies on the link between diet and disease have led to dietary advice and guidelines on how much saturated fat, particularly cholesterol, it is healthy to eat. Millions of people in the UK have been prescribed statins to reduce cholesterol levels. Dr Malhotra, a cardiology registrar at Croydon University Hospital, London, says the "mantra that saturated fat must be removed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has dominated dietary advice and guidelines for almost four decades". He says saturated fat has been "demonised" and any link with heart disease is not fully supported by scientific evidence. The food industry has compensated for lowering saturated fat levels in food by replacing it with sugar, he says, which also contributes to heart disease. Adopting a Mediterranean diet - olive oil, nuts, oily fish, plenty of fruit and vegetables and a moderate amount of red wine - after a heart attack is almost three times as powerful in reducing mortality as taking a statin, writes Dr Malhotra. However, Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, says studies on the link between diet and disease frequently produce conflicting results. Unlike drug trials, it is difficult to carry out a controlled, randomised study, he says. "However, people with highest cholesterol levels are at highest risk of a heart attack and it's also clear that lowering cholesterol, by whatever means, lowers risk." Cholesterol levels can be influenced by many factors including diet, exercise and drugs, in particular statins, he adds. "There is clear evidence that patients who have had a heart attack, or who are at high risk of having one, can benefit from taking a statin. "But this needs to be combined with other essential measures, such as eating a balanced diet, not smoking and taking regular exercise." Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower rates of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol can also be reduced by eating a healthy, balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight and doing regular physical activity. </body>

      <title>Black women get 'worse' breast cancer</title>
      <description>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop 'worse' breast cancer, research reveals.</description>

      <body>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop "worse" breast cancer with a poorer prognosis, research suggests. This group has larger, more aggressive tumours with a higher risk of recurrence. This is despite having the same access to treatment, the study in the British Journal of Cancer shows. As yet unidentified biological factors may be to blame, say the Cancer Research UK investigators. Such women might respond less well to breast cancer drugs like tamoxifen because of the genetic make-up of their tumour, they say. The research team, based at the University of Southampton, looked at data from nearly 3,000 UK women - of whom 118 were black - who were younger than 40 when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. Even when individual differences such as body weight and treatment variations such as availability of chemotherapy were taken into account, black ethnicity remained an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Dr Ellen Copson and colleagues say there have been similar findings in the US, suggesting this could be an international trend, but further research is needed to try to pin down the exact cause or causes. Early diagnosis may also play a role if black women are less aware of the symptoms or less "breast aware", and so less likely to identify worrying changes, they say. This could mean their cancer is diagnosed at a later stage which would reduce the chance of successful treatment and recovery. Although NHS treatment is designed to be equal for all, some cultural factors such as recent immigration to the UK or language barriers may in practice affect use of health services, they say. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: "It's worrying that ethnic background may be a factor influencing a woman's chance of surviving breast cancer. We know that some ethnic populations carry higher genetic risks of getting certain types of breast cancer, but if this difference is down to symptom awareness or access to healthcare, that is particularly concerning. "More research is needed to look into the reason why young black women have higher rates of recurrence, but in the meantime women of any ethnic background should be aware of what is normal for their breasts and get any new lumps or anything unusual checked out by their GP. More often than not breast changes won't mean cancer, but it's best to get any unusual changes checked out." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save £500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS £2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra £500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise £200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between £60m and £80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is £20m-£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further £50m-£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" £500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's £500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed £200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than £200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Child bone-marrow transplant 'first'</title>
      <description>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique for sick children.</description>

      <body>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique. They say the method should help with donor shortages since it does not require a perfect cell match. Mohammed Ahmed, who is nearly five years old, was among the first three children in the world to try out the new treatment. He has severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and had been waiting for a suitable donor for years. Mohammed, who lives in Milton Keynes, was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital when he was a year old. His condition - a weak immune system - makes him more susceptible to infections than most, and a bone marrow transplant is the only known treatment. While Mohammed was on the transplant waiting list, he became extremely sick with swine flu. At that time, his doctors decided Mohammed's only real hope was to have a mismatched bone-marrow transplant, with his father acting as the donor. Mohammed's dad, Jamil, agreed to give the experimental therapy a go. Before giving his donation, Jamil was first vaccinated against swine flu so that his own bone-marrow cells would know how to fight the infection. Mohammed's doctors then modified these donated immune cells, called "T-cells", in the lab to engineer a safety switch - a self-destruct message that could be activated if Mohammed's body should start to reject them once transplanted. Rejection or graft-v-host disease is a serious complication of bone-marrow transplants, particularly where tissue matching between donor and recipient is not perfect, and is one of the most difficult challenges faced by patients and their doctors. Mismatched transplants in children - where the donor is not a close match for the child - are usually depleted of T-cells to prevent graft-v-host disease, but this causes problems in terms of virus infections and leukaemia relapse. The safety switch gets round this - plenty of T-cells to be transfused and later killed off if problems do arise. Thankfully, the transplant carried out in 2011 was a success - Mohammed's doctors did not need to use the safety switch. Although Mohammed still has to take a number of medicines to ward off future infections, his immune system is now in better shape. Jamil said: "We waited for a full match but it did not come. By the grace of God, we took the decision to have the treatment. "Now he is all right. Sometimes we forget what he has been through. We are just so grateful." He said Mohammed would still need close monitoring and regular health checks over the coming years, but his outlook was good. Dr Waseem Qasim, ‎consultant in paediatric immunology at Great Ormond Street Hospital and lead author for the study, said the new approach should hopefully mean children who received a mismatched transplant could enjoy the same chance of success as those given a fully matched transplant. "We think Mohammed is cured of his disorder. He should be able to lead a fairly normal life now." A full report about Mohammed's therapy and the research by Great Ormond Street Hospital, King's College London and the Institute of Child Health has just been published in PLoS One journal. There are currently about 1,600 people in the UK waiting for a bone-marrow transplant and 37,000 worldwide. Just 30% of people will find a matching donor from within their families. Donations involve collecting blood from a vein or aspirating bone marrow from the pelvis using a needle and syringe. </body>

      <body>Health bosses have vowed to launch legal proceedings to move French travellers who are blocking a car park used by hospital workers. Officials had asked the travellers to move 13 caravans from the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport by 16:00 BST on Tuesday. However the travellers - who are taking up 65 spaces - said they would not leave until Wednesday. The travellers arrived at the 300-space car park late Saturday on afternoon. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After visiting the site on Tuesday morning, Jamie Marchant, director of facilities at the Aneurin Bevan Health Board, told BBC Radio Wales: "I have spoken to a few of the travellers and they're very friendly and very amicable. "They have indicated to us previously that they are moving on tomorrow [Wednesday]. "They've also indicated they are parked up for a funeral." After the Tuesday afternoon deadline passed, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was now resorting to the law. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm today," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. </body>

      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Mental health veterans therapy fear</title>
      <description>Armed forces veterans struggling with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder are being put at risk from a therapy used by a Welsh charity, a BBC investigation finds.</description>

      <body>Armed forces veterans struggling with mental health issues are being put at risk from a therapy used by a Welsh charity, a BBC investigation has found. Healing the Wounds in Porthcawl has been asked to stop using Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), which tries to change people's patterns of mental and emotional behaviour. It is not regulated or approved and can make patients worse. The charity said it is gathering data to prove its treatment is effective. But two veterans interviewed for the BBC's Week In Week Out programme claim it was the therapy they received at Healing the Wounds that made them feel suicidal. Both men, one of whom went undercover for the programme, said they felt worse after their treatment. Dr Neil Kitchiner, head of the NHS All Wales Veterans Health and Wellbeing service, said he has not seen evidence of the treatment working. "None of them are cured as far as I've seen, after three days treatment," he said. "Some have been made very unwell as a result of going there and have needed a lot of support from NHS and veterans' charities. "We have asked them to stop it. "We have shown the evidence from the NHS and from the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines, we've shared our concerns with them and yet they continue to operate in the way they do." Healing The Wounds was set up by Bridgend couple Kevin and Carol Richards and has raised almost £500,000 in the last three years. They insist it is offering a safe and effective alternative therapy for veterans. But on the programme some describe feeling even worse after a three-day residential course during which veterans are sent to a hotel overnight. One veteran, who did not want to be identified, said the course of therapy left him feeling suicidal. "I did two full days and on the third I left and my wife came to collect me," he said. "When she came through the doors it was such a relief, I was left feeling worse than when I first went into Healing The Wounds." The undercover veteran, who does not have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but described suffering some of the symptoms, was told by Carol Richards during therapy that it had taken her just 20 minutes to help one soldier who had seen many of his colleagues killed. No attempt was made to contact the undercover veteran's GP to check his physical or mental health before therapy began. Prof Neil Greenberg, co-director of the Academic Centre for Defence Mental Health at Kings College London, said: "If this group who are not medically qualified and don't know a person's whole treatment history, because they haven't got that, that could cause some real problems, it could be quite dangerous." Healing the Wounds said it is collecting data to prove its treatment is effective, but Prof Greenberg says unless NLP is subjected to what are known as randomised clinical trials it cannot be established as an appropriate treatment for PTSD. He added: "NLP has not been investigated by proper scientific trials to show it works. "The key point is, just because someone feels good at end session, there is no guarantee they're going to feel good in the future. "And given the fact we know psychological therapies have potential to harm we need to do those trails." The programme also discovered that regulators have investigated the qualifications of a counsellor who had falsely been described as a clinical psychologist and a paramedic while helping vulnerable veterans for the charity. John Yandle from Blaenavon claims Healing The Wounds did not check his qualifications before he began counselling people with PTSD who had turned to it for help. The Health and Care Professions Council which polices the appropriate use of job titles including paramedic and clinical psychologist has ordered him not to use the titles in future. Mr Yandle, who does have counselling qualifications, denied deliberately misleading people and says the charity had mistakenly referred to him as a paramedic on its website. Darren Millar, chair of the Welsh assembly's cross-party group on the Armed Forces, is calling for better regulation of charities offering mental health services to veterans. He said: "Because there is no regulation anybody can set up as an NLP practitioner and the quality of their work is not monitored by anybody so that puts potential risks out in the field for anybody accessing those sorts of services." "What we need is some proper arrangements for oversight of the quality of the work being done by any charity that is giving some support to veterans. "What is important is to measure the outcomes when any organisation is offering this sort of service to see if it is making a real difference in the lives of the people who contact it." The Charities Commission has confirmed it is investigating Healing the Wounds and its links to The Forces Aid Foundation - set up by Kevin Richards and wrongly described as a charity on its website. Mr Richards thanked the programme for pointing out the error and said it would amend its website. The Welsh government said it has spent £500,000 on the All Wales Veterans Health and Well Being Service. A spokesman added: "We are clear that where any body offers treatment for any condition, they should ensure that these are in line with evidence based guidelines. "This is a stipulation for the NHS but an expectation for general good practice more broadly." Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales on Tuesday, 22 October 2013 at 22:35 BST </body>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." The National Union of Students (NUS) said it was working to make support for mental health issues a higher priority in universities and colleges. Vice-president Colum McGuire said: "For some the stress and new surroundings that come with leaving to go to university can trigger mental health issues." "NUS is concerned about cuts to services that support students facing these challenges, particularly around poor referrals on to outside services, and whether those services themselves actually have adequate resources to help students." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <title>Theme park defends asylum attraction</title>
      <description>Calls are made to shut down a Halloween attraction at a theme park which features actors dressed as mental health patients.</description>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental illness. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 900 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70287000/jpg/_70287873_sweetthings.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>
      <description>"The hopes and fears I have for my daughter"</description>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24550586</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70516000/jpg/_70516561_midwifeandpregnantwoman.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth chemical plant to close</title>
      <description>The operator of the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland says the site's petrochemical plant is to close.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24631342</url>

      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments as to whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments as to whether the city of Detroit should be granted protection from its creditors. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. Union and pension fund representatives will argue against the bankruptcy filing as they want to preserve payments to former city workers. They say that city officials have not properly negotiated with creditors. According to the unions and pension funds, Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, did not hold formal negotiating sessions before filing for bankruptcy. They are also likely to argue that the city is not bankrupt and has assets that can be sold, including pieces from the Detroit Institute of Arts. City managers say they have negotiated in good faith and bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's $18bn in debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. "There are only so many things they can fight about," said John Pottow, a University of Michigan professor who specialises in bankruptcy law. "They can fight about the solvency and they can fight about the negotiating in good faith." Lawyers from both sides will present evidence and call witnesses before the federal bankruptcy judge, Steven Rhodes. He has allotted 10 days for hearings over the next three weeks, although the hearings could take less time than that. He will then decide whether Detroit merits protection from its creditors under Chapter 9 of the US bankruptcy code, which would allow the city to reorganise its debts. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers have shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. It is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <body>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has said its drug sales in China during the July-to-September quarter sank 61% after it was hit by a bribery scandal. Andrew Witty, chief executive at GSK, said it was too early to predict when the business might recover. But he added there was "absolutely no question" of the company pulling out of China. The pharmaceutical giant allegedly used travel companies to channel 3bn yuan (£300m) to bribe doctors and officials. GSK admitted some of its executives in China broke the law when Chinese authorities took four GSK employees into custody in connection with the allegations earlier this year. "We continue to co-operate with the authorities and we remain fully committed to supplying our products to patients in the country," the company said in a statement. "At this stage, it is still too early for us to quantify the longer-term impact of the investigation on our performance in China." The investigation into GSK, which is one of Beijing's largest into a foreign company, started in July and also includes other pharmaceutical companies. The drop in sales was bigger than many analysts predicted and hit the company's pre-tax profit - which fell 6% to £1.4bn. Mr Witty said the business had suffered most where there had been options from other drug companies. However, GSK predicted its sales growth for the year would be about 1%. The multinational company, which makes Panadol, Sensodyne and Aquafresh among other things, sees China as an important market for future growth. It has a research centre, 7,000 staff and five factories based in the country, although at the moment less than 4% of its sales are generated there. </body>

      <title>Bank says UK prospects improving</title>
      <description>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to the Bank of England's latest minutes.</description>

      <body>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to Bank of England policymakers. Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's October meeting show that prospects for the rest of 2013 are better than was forecast in August. The minutes show that the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The MPC noted that business and consumer confidence continued to grow. The UK unemployment rate is currently at 7.7%. In August, when the Bank unveiled its strategy of forward guidance, the rate stood at 7.8%. At that time the Bank predicted it would take three years for the rate to fall to 7%, the rate at which it will start to consider interest rate rises. The October minutes said: "It now therefore seemed probable that unemployment would be lower, and output growth faster, in the second half of 2013 than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report." However, policymakers were divided about how fast productivity would pick up, and by extension, how fast unemployment would fall as the economy recovers. "It was too soon to draw a firm conclusion from recent labour market outturns about the extent to which productivity would increase," the minutes said. MPC members also noted a strengthening in sterling, which would push down on inflation. The Bank's goal is to return consumer price inflation to 2%. Inflation has exceeded 2% since December 2009, and currently stands at 2.7%. </body>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <body>Boeing has announced plans to raise production of its 787 Dreamliner to 12 per month by 2016. That would be an increase from its target for the end of this year of 10 planes a month. The Dreamliner has experienced major problems since its introduction two years ago. It was grounded in January of this year for more than three months while investigators examined why batteries were catching fire. Boeing also reported an 11% rise in net earnings to $1.16 billion dollars for the three months to the end of September. That was better than analysts were expecting and Boeing shares rose almost 6%. The strong performance was partly due to its commercial aircraft division where sales rose 15%. Sales at its defence, space and security business rose just 3% and sales of military aircraft fell during the quarter. "Despite the uncertainty of the US defence market, overall our customer focused business strategies and disciplined execution on our programmes are producing the results we expect," said Boeing's chief executive, Jim McNerney. </body>

      <title>ECB outlines bank healthchecks</title>
      <description>Bank shares across Europe fall after details of planned healthchecks of the top lenders were unveiled by the European Central Bank.</description>

      <body>Bank shares across Europe have fallen after details of planned healthchecks on the top lenders were unveiled. The European Central Bank, which takes over supervision of leading eurozone banks next year, said the stress tests would unearth potential risks. Banks with capital shortfalls may be required to bolster their balance sheets, the ECB said. The Euro Stoxx index of big eurozone banks was down more than 2.5% in late morning trading. ECB president Mario Draghi said: "A single comprehensive assessment, uniformly applied to all significant banks, accounting for about 85% of the euro area banking system, is an important step forward for Europe and for the future of the euro area economy. "We expect that this assessment will strengthen private sector confidence in the soundness of euro area banks and in the quality of their balance sheets," he said. The exercise will start next month, and will take about 12 months. The ECB said the aim was to "foster transparency, to repair and to build confidence". Berenberg Bank senior economist Christian Schulz said: "The exercise will increase transparency, trigger further balance sheet repair and restore confidence in the eurozone banking sector. "A successful exercise could complete the process of healing after the Lehman and eurozone crises." A provisional list of banks to be reviewed includes 24 German banks, 16 in Spain, 15 in Italy, 13 in France, seven in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and four each in Greece, Cyprus and Portugal. About 128 banks will eventually be scrutinised to ensure their stability and highlight potential risks to the financial system. An asset quality review will look at "sovereign and institutional holdings and corporate and retail exposures, and both the banking and trading books will be reviewed", the ECB said. Another part of the review will look at liquidity, leverage and funding. Thirdly, the banks will be stress-tested against various scenarios to ensure their resilience to sudden shocks in the banking system. Banks will be required to hold a capital buffer of 8%. When assessing banks' capital, the ECB said it would use the European Banking Authority's definition, which classifies bank loans that are more than 90 days overdue as non-performing. Italian bank shares were hit, and Spain's Bankia fell more than 5%. Germany's Commerzbank was down 3%. The ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will cover 24 banks that make up about 65% of the German banking sector. Bundesbank deputy president Sabine Lautenschlaeger said the process "will be a tour de force for German banks and their supervisors", but added that "the effort will be worthwhile, as the SSM will give us the opportunity of getting the best out of all supervisory cultures in the euro area". </body>

      <body>Post Office managers are to take their first industrial action in 34 years in a dispute over pay. The Unite union, which represents 900 managers, said its members would ban overtime and work to rule for 24 hours on Friday. Unite said it had been in talks for 16 months over a pay deal, but "intransigence" by the company had forced managers into action. The Post Office said it was "disappointed" by the decision. Post Office workers are involved in a separate dispute over jobs and pay, and are planning a strike in November. The Unite union said industrial action by managers would be stepped up if there was no agreement. National officer Brian Scott said: "Unite members will not undertake any overtime, will refuse to work any additional hours or do work not proper to their role in the organisation. "They will also refuse to travel outside of their working time, nor will they work in a location other than their normal place of employment. "This is an important day for Unite members in the Post Office. They are keen to impress upon their employer their dissatisfaction with the failure to reach a pay agreement with the union and see this an opportunity to protest," Mr Scott said. A Post Office spokesman said: "We are disappointed that Unite has chosen to call industrial action at a time when we are continuing constructive discussions to resolve the current dispute. "We are confident that the majority of our managers do not support this action and will be working as normal on Friday." </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>
      <date>1382520781</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70652000/jpg/_70652651_fb.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <description>Growing consumer confidence is creating more demand for mortgages and increasing credit card spending, a banking body says.</description>

      <body>Growing consumer confidence is creating more demand for mortgages and higher spending on credit cards, a banking body has said. The British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the major High Street banks, said that the number of mortgage approvals rose in September. In addition, borrowing on credit cards outstripped repayments. However, the figures do not signal a return to the kind of credit boom seen before the financial crisis. Low interest rates in the UK have led to competitive deals for borrowers, but have been frustrating for many savers looking to find a good return for their funds. Mortgage rates have been particularly low for those able to raise a deposit and wishing to secure a deal. The latest BBA figures show that the number of mortgages approved for house purchases in September stood at 42,990. This was up from 38,834 the previous month and nearly 7,000 higher than the average of the last six months. "September's figures build on the growing picture of improved consumer confidence, with stronger gross mortgage lending, rising house purchase approvals and increased consumer credit," said David Dooks, statistics director at the BBA. However, one mortgage broker said that some people were still keen to play safe with credit. "There remains a strong trend for borrowers to overpay on their mortgages, taking advantage of low interest rates and paying down debt where they can," said Mark Harris, chief executive of SPF Private Clients. "Confidence may be growing in the housing market but homeowners are reluctant to take on more borrowing while there is still uncertainty with regard to the economic and jobs' climate." </body>

      <body>Dutch brewer Heineken has scaled back its profit forecast after a drop in sales in Europe, Brazil and parts of Africa. It said profits would decrease in the "low single-digits", rather than stay "broadly in line" with last year's figure. The company said the weak market for beer in parts of Europe was partly behind the revision. Heineken said it would be restructuring the business and cutting costs. It also said the strength of the euro against emerging markets would affect profits this year by about 40m euros. The group, which is the largest seller of beer in Europe, saw an 8% drop in beer sales across central and eastern Europe, with weak spending in Russia, Romania and Greece. Difficulties in Nigeria, Egypt and the Democratic Republic of Congo also hit sales, Heineken said. Chief executive at Heineken, Jean-François van Boxmeer, said underlying trading conditions across Europe were still "challenging", despite growth in western Europe. He said: "Looking forward, we remain confident that our broad geographic spread and strong brand portfolio will continue to support long-term growth for Heineken." </body>

      <body>The owner of the Argos and Homebase retail chains has said its turnaround plans are on track with both divisions reporting a rise in sales. Home Retail Group said total sales in the six months to 31 August rose 3% to £2.59bn, with Argos up 2.3% and Homebase 5.9% higher. Pre-tax profits fell to £14.2m from a re-stated £46.7m last year. But after stripping out one-off items, the underlying profit was up 53% to £27.4m. After seeing profits decline for five years in a row, Home Retail Group is updating its Homebase stores and seeking to revamp Argos by increasing sales through its website. The firm said that total internet sales now accounted for 43% of Argos' total sales, with sales generated through smartphones and tablets representing 16% of sales. Last month, Argos announced a tie-up with eBay, whereby shoppers will be able to order selected goods from eBay and pick them up from an Argos store. Chief executive Terry Duddy said: "Argos and Homebase are making good progress with their investment plans, and remain on track to deliver their long term strategic objectives." However, he added that the general retail climate remained tough. "As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect consumer spending will remain subdued, and whilst some macroeconomic indicators are improving, these have not yet led to an increase in household disposable income." Mr Duddy, who is stepping down as Home Retail Group chief by next July after 15 years at the helm, said the group was in "excellent shape" in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period. Argos's underlying operating profits jumped £7.7m in the six months, up from £3.3m last year, with the company saying there had been particularly strong demand for tablet computers. Argos recently followed Tesco in announcing the launch of its own-brand tablet, called MyTablet, which will be on sale for less than £100 as part of its Christmas product range. Home Retail Group also said there had been a reversal in the fortunes at its Homebase DIY chain. A surge in demand for garden furniture in the summer heatwave helped Homebase's like-for-like sales rise 5.9%, marking the strongest growth since it was bought by Home Retail Group in 2002. </body>

      <body>Spain's economy has emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years, according to estimates from the Bank of Spain. Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.1% between July and September, the bank said. However, GDP was still 1.2% lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Spain's economy has been struggling ever since the credit crisis struck in 2008. The bank's figures are an estimate, and the country's National Statistics agency INE is due to release preliminary third quarter GDP data on 31 October. The Bank of Spain said the country's economy had been helped by stronger exports in the past quarter. "The slight recovery in activity in the third quarter after the fall a quarter earlier is due to... a more favourable contribution from the external sector," it said in its monthly bulletin. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the fallout from the credit crisis. The crisis burst the country's housing bubble, and its banks needed government bailouts to survive after being left holding hundreds of billions of euros in bad debts. Its unemployment rate of more than 26% is one of the highest in Europe. Government austerity measures aimed at cutting Spain's large deficit prompted huge protests across the country last year. However, the government recently claimed that the end of the recession was near, saying reforms and austerity measures were paying off. Ignacio del Torre, economist at financial advisory firm Arcano, said: "After recently implemented reforms, Spain has become an export powerhouse. "It will fully leave the recession behind in 2014 with private investment and consumption growth turning positive after three years of decline and credit levels stabilising," he added. </body>

      <body>Nobel Prize-winning economist Lawrence Klein, whose statistical models have been used to analyse and predict global economic trends, has died aged 93. Mr Klein, who died at his home near Philadelphia on Sunday, was widely regarded as the founder of modern economic forecasting. He famously predicted America's post World War II boom, which at the time, countered theories of a new recession. This was achieved through computer-based models known as 'econometrics'. Much of his career was spent teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, which he first joined in 1958. He retired from full-time teaching in 1991 to become a professor emeritus. It was there that his famous 'Wharton Models' of econometrics were developed, eventually leading to his Nobel Prize in 1980. Lawrence Robert Klein was born in Omaha on September 14, 1920, and grew up in the midst of the Great Depression. The second of three children, Mr Klein said growing up during that period played a large part in his personal development and career. "Although I was not aware of it at the time, growing up during the Great Depression was to have a profound impact on my intellectual and professional career," he wrote in autobiographical note. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley before going on to get his doctoral degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr Klein also spent four years at Oxford University's Institute of Statistics, where he built an economic model for the UK. He served as as an economic advisor to Jimmy Carter's successful presidential campaign in 1976 and advised numerous governments later in his career. He is survived by his wife Sonia, three daughters and a son. </body>

      <title>Benefit cap 'not achieving aims'</title>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than £500 a week, while a £350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given £1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add £2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <title>Energy bosses called before MPs</title>
      <description>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms are being called before MPs to give evidence about recent price rises.</description>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit by increasing prices. Scottish Power, which has just been hit with a penalty by regulator Ofgem after sales staff misled customers, said it faced the same cost pressures as competitors and was likely to "move on prices" before the end of the year. The chairman of the committee of MPs, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The energy companies have argued that the price rises were the result of higher wholesale costs, increased costs in delivering energy to customers' homes, and the effect of the levy charged to companies to fund environmental measures. The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir John Major has called for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. </body>

      <title>Australia to raise debt limit by 60%</title>
      <description>The Australian government says it plans to raise the country's debt limit by two-thirds to forestall any concerns it could face a fiscal crisis.</description>

      <body>The Australian government has said it plans to raise the country's debt limit by two-thirds to allay concerns it could face a future fiscal crisis. The newly-elected conservative government is looking to raise the borrowing limit to A$500bn ($486bn; £300bn). Australia is forecast to reach its current A$300bn ceiling in December. Treasurer Joe Hockey said that he wanted to avoid a crisis similar to the recent US fiscal emergency. "The debt limit needs to be set so as to provide sufficient headroom to ensure there is stability and certainty for the financial markets about the government's capacity to finance its operations for the foreseeable future," Mr Hockey said. "We need not look any further than the recent events in the United States to realise how imperative for stability and certainty is for confidence." Earlier this month, the US government was partially shutdown for 16 days after the Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach an agreement over the country's budget and raising the debt ceiling. The situation was resolved last week after Congress hammered together a last-minute deal to temporarily raise the debt limit until the end of the first week of February 2014. However, financial markets were rattled by the US political deadlock, which brought the country closer to the possibility of defaulting on its debts. There was little reaction in the Australian financial markets to Tuesday's announcement. Australian government debt is popular among many investors because of its top AAA credit rating. That means it is regarded as the safest kind of investment by the ratings agencies who look at the risks associated with government borrowing, as well as for companies. At the same time, Australia's total debt, expressed as a percentage of its total economic output (GDP), is relatively low compared to other developed nations. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Australia's debt is expected to be around 30% of its GDP this year, compared to 92% for the UK and nearly 106% for the US. Mr Hockey said that the government was keen to keep its debt levels in check. "We are not going to allow ourselves to get into the position that the United States is in where there's tremendous uncertainty about the capacity of a country to live within its means," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is set to hold his first parliament sittings in late October, which will give the government up to six weeks to pass the legislation required to raise the debt limit. The government is also set to face an audit commissioned by the Treasury, which is aimed at streamlining government services and reducing wasteful spending. </body>

      <title>US added 148,000 jobs in September</title>
      <description>The US economy added a lower-than-expected 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.2%.</description>

      <body>The US economy added 148,000 jobs in September, official figures show, lower than analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell to 7.2%, down from 7.3% in August, the US Department of Labor said. The release of the figures was delayed by the partial shutdown of the US government earlier this month. Economists had predicted 180,000 job gains for September, and the lower-than-expected figure could raise fears the US economy is losing momentum. Employment in professional and business services grew at the fastest pace with 32,000 new jobs added. Leisure and hospitality was the only sector to see a fall with 13,000 jobs lost. Carl Leahey, senior adviser at Decision Economics, said the report was "so-so", and meant the US central bank was likely to continue its massive $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. "This report will soften people's assessments of current conditions. With the possibility of a replay of the budget showdown as early as mid-January, why would the Fed want to pull any levers now?," he said. Following the figures, stock markets turned higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5% at 6,688 and both the Dow futures and broader SandP index futures up 0.3%, as investors bet on the Fed continuing its stimulus programme at the same pace. The dollar fell, under pressure from the expectation that the stimulus programme, which effectively creates more dollars, will continue at the same rate. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, maintained its economic stimulus programme last month, suggesting it was still uncertain about the strength of the economic recovery. "Today's underperforming jobs number fully justifies September's cautious FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)," said Joseph Trevisani, chief market strategist at WorldwideMarkets. The Labor Department said the next US unemployment data would be released on 8 November, a week later than scheduled due to the partial shutdown of the US government. Its workers were placed on unpaid leave during the shutdown raising fears the department will struggle to collect accurate data for October. "The October survey will be compromised by the late survey and the unquantifiable indirect private sector job losses triggered by the shutdown, and the November numbers will be compromised by the recovery - we hope - of those same jobs," said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. </body>

      <body>Government borrowing fell in September, official figures show, helped by higher tax revenues. Public sector net borrowing, excluding the cost of interventions such as bank bailouts, was £11.1bn, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The figure is lower than the £12.1bn recorded in September 2012. The UK's net public debt pile stands at £1.21 trillion, which is equivalent to 75.9% of GDP. The government is aiming for a deficit of no more than £120bn this year, excluding the effect of cash transfers from Royal Mail and the Bank of England. For the first half of the current tax year, the deficit on this measure totalled £56.7bn, down more than 9% compared with the same period a year previously. Total cash receipts between April and September rose to £265.3bn, up from £237bn a year earlier. Efforts to reduce UK borrowing and cut the country's debts are central to the government's economic policies. Chancellor George Osborne has said that a re-elected Conservative government would aim to wipe out Britain's budget deficit altogether by 2020. Speaking at at a Thomson Reuters event, Mr Osborne warned the UK's problems weren't over. "An improving economic situation in the UK does not automatically lead to a windfall for the public finances... we are going to go on as a government having to take very difficult decisions to control public spending and make sure we are on top of the deficit." Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures put the government on track for the full year. "The hope is that the trend in the public finances will increasingly improve over the coming months as improved economic activity increasingly feeds through to boost tax revenues and help limit benefit payments," he added. However, Chris Leslie MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government's deficit plan was "way off track". "Three years of flatlining growth and falling living standards mean George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by 2015. He's forecast to borrow over £200bn more than planned simply to pay for the costs of his economic failure." </body>

      <title>The tech boss who says it is all about the staff</title>
      <description>A profile of Robert Stanzione, the boss of technology firm Arris, which has expanded greatly under his stewardship.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517646</url>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24516542</url>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>

      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Milk Cup tournament loses sponsor</title>
      <description>The Milk Cup youth football tournament is dealt a blow after the Dairy Council ends its sponsorship of the competition.</description>

      <body>The Milk Cup youth football tournament has been dealt a blow after the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland ended its sponsorship of the annual competition. A statement from the Dairy Council said that the decision had been taken following a "strategic review" of its activities in Northern Ireland. The Dairy Council began sponsoring the tournament in 1983. "This was not an easy decision for us but no sponsorship is permanent," said Dairy Council chief Mike Johnston. The competition's traditional base over the last 30 years has been Coleraine with games also taking place in Portrush, Portstewart, Ballymoney and Limavady. In more recent years, the finals night has taken place at the Ballymena Showgrounds while there have also been games in places such as Cloughmills and Broughshane. Despite Monday's announcement, tournament chairman Victor Leonard told BBC Sport that planning is already well underway for the 2014 competition and that it would "definitely go ahead" next summer. "The future of the Milk Cup is very secure," added the tournament chairman. "2014 will be a very strong event. We are at an advanced stage with teams and actually looking to enhance the event. "The partnership with the Dairy Council has been a very exciting and very beneficial one but we already have some things going on in the background, preparing for this day." However, there is no doubt that the loss of the main sponsor has to be regarded as a blow for the youth tournament. "The Milk Cup has been a hugely important and successful sponsorship for the Dairy Council since we became involved 30 years ago but the market has evolved," added the Dairy Council chief executive, Mr Johnston. "But we need to ensure that our activities meet the needs of the Northern Ireland dairy industry. "We are delighted that over the past three decades we have played our part in making the Milk Cup one of the top events of its kind in the world. "One of the things that attracted us to the event in the early 1980s was the opportunity it provided for local lads to have the experience of playing against teams from other countries and cultures. "At a time when Northern Ireland was in the grip of a dark period in its history and amidst negative publicity in international media, it will always be a testament to the tournament that teams from all over the world were prepared to come to Northern Ireland." Future stars who have played in the tournament include David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Neil Lennon, Joe Cole and Keith Gillespie. </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <title>I'll step aside - Kilmarnock chairman</title>
      <description>Michael Johnston says he is willing to step down as chairman of Kilmarnock if the right investors can be found.</description>

      <body>Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston says he would step aside from his position if the right investors can be attracted to Rugby Park. Johnston has been under pressure from fans groups to leave the club and was the subject of more protests during Saturday's 2-0 win over Ross County. But he insisted to BBC Scotland that he is open to change. "I'm looking for more local business people to work in partnership for the benefit of the club," said Johnston. "Billy Bowie is the first person since the Moffat family to table an offer of finance." Johnston, who inherited the Scottish Premiership club from the Moffats, revealed that Ayrshire businessman Bowie had invested £200,000 in Kilmarnock, with a further £1.1m promised. The chairman believes he has more to achieve before leaving Kilmarnock and intends reducing debts of around £9m. However, he admitted that, if new investors offer the right money, he would consider his position. Johnston has held talks with the Kilmarnock Futures Consortium and the group is understood to be set to present its takeover plan to the Kilmarnock chairman shortly. Bowie is also believed to be open to working with the consortium headed up by Alan McLeish from the club's kit sponsor, QTS. The 2-0 victory over County was Kilmarnock's first of the season and the first for Allan Johnston, who was appointed manager in the summer. Supporters held up red cards in the 18th and 69th minutes, symbolic of when the club was founded in 1869, in protest at the chairman's running of the club. </body>

      <body>Chairman of Grangemouth Petrochemicals Calum MacLean has said it's a "very sad day" after the plant's owner Ineos announced it is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs. The move came after union members rejected a "survival plan" which would have seen Ineos invest £300m in Grangemouth - but only if workers agreed to a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Mr MacLean told the BBC the company's liquidator would decide whether workers would receive redundancy payouts "There's a lot of very emotional people in there and a lot of tears... It was the rejection of that survival plan - mainly by the Unite members - that has ultimately meant we can't deliver it." </body>

      <description>Why the Grangemouth plant matters to the UK</description>

      <body>Ineos says the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth is to close while the oil refinery will remain open. Around 800 jobs will be affected by the closure. In total Grangemouth employs 1,370 staff and a dispute between union members and staff remains unresolved. The loss of the petrochemicals plant is a major blow and now the focus will be on the refinery which is a key part of the Scottish and UK economy. The Grangemouth refinery supplies 70% of the fuel used at Scotland's filling stations and it also supplies fuel to Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. Grangemouth is an important employer and the 800 jobs lost by the closure of the petrochemicals plant are a big loss. Along with the refinery, Grangemouth employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the site. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the business is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth's refinery is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is due to close. </body>

      <title>'American nightmare' in Detroit</title>
      <description>What happens if Detroit cuts payments to pensioners?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24633916</url>
      <date>1382542053</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70649000/jpg/_70649041_p1000373.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Three months ago, Detroit became the largest city to file for bankruptcy in US history. The trial to determine whether a city of Detroit's size can stop paying its bills will have huge potential repercussions for cities and states across the country. Perhaps no-one is awaiting the trial's outcome as much as Erma and Gordon MacDonald, who have been married for 63 years. "I'm smarter than her," jokes Mr MacDonald, 87. "Only a stupid person would agree to marry me." A jester at heart, Mr MacDonald says people always ask him why he laughs so much. Mrs MacDonald, 82, has an easy answer: "It's so we don't cry." In their tiny one-bedroom flat decorated with photos of their children and grandchildren, the MacDonalds grow silent. They contemplate a future in which the pension that Mr MacDonald earned over 39 years with the Detroit Police disappears - a potential casualty of Detroit's bankruptcy filing. "I don't know what else to say - we're up in the air," Mr MacDonald says. He worries more about his wife, who is in poor health, than about himself. "I take 15 prescriptions," says Mrs MacDonald, "and I kind of jokingly said if they take [my healthcare] away, which pills do I stop without dying?" While it might seem unfathomable that the MacDonalds could face such a choice, the reality is that if Detroit's bankruptcy filing is allowed to proceed, the city will face extremely difficult decisions. Kevin Orr, the emergency manager brought in to run the city by the state of Michigan, argues there is no way forward for Detroit other than through the fresh financial start that bankruptcy brings. The city is anywhere from $18bn (£11bn) to $20bn in debt - with $9bn a result of ballooning pension and healthcare costs. It has already cut basic services to the bone, pushing more residents to flee. The city's population now stands at 700,000, down from two million at Detroit's peak. Wait times for emergency calls now top one hour, and less than a third of the streetlights function. More than 80,000 properties have been abandoned. Nature, it seems, moves faster than federal court. Despite all the hardship, those representing the city's pension schemes say a bankruptcy filing would allow the city to renege on promises made long ago. They dispute Mr Orr's calculations, and say it's unfair that the 23,500 retirees who spent their lives working to keep Detroit safe and clean could be left with nothing. "They're taking away the American dream and turning it into the American nightmare," says Donald Hall, who spent 29 years as a detention centre officer and now depends on the $850 he receives from the city every month. There's no question that Detroit is unique among US cities, to fly so high and fall so far, to build landmarks like the majestic Michigan Central Station that less than a hundred years later have the aura of Roman ruins. So then what impact, if any, could a successful bankruptcy filing have on other cities? "On the one hand, Detroit is in an unusual position because it has had massive depopulation coupled with a collapse of the industrial sector," says University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, an expert in bankruptcy law. "On the other hand, Detroit was not alone in making legal commitments to people which it had no funding for." According to a study by economists at Northwestern University, cities and counties across the US have a total of $574bn in unfunded pension obligations. Already, cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and San Diego, California, have shown signs they are crumbling under the weight of the financial promises made to retirees. "If Detroit is able to file for bankruptcy, then every other big city is going to be watching this," says Prof Pottow. James Canty is a lifelong Detroit resident and manager of the city's parking department. I followed him on his daily rounds as he tried to rid the city of some of the thousands of abandoned cars that line its streets. The job was once done by the police. Now, Mr Canty's team has taken on the role of enforcer in an attempt to free up overworked officers. In neighbourhoods where it's hard to tell which, if any, of the houses are occupied, Mr Canty points to a white Chevrolet sedan with shattered windows here, a pick-up truck missing a wheel there. Frequently, as soon as a tow truck arrives to remove the offending vehicle, the vehicle's owner suddenly appears, as if by magic. The excuses are often similar - what looks like a derelict car is in fact in the process of being mended. It's not hard to see Detroit's financial position in the same way as these dented and decrepit cars - they may or may not be broken, depending on who is looking at them. Is it better to clear the way for something new - or to be forced to fix what only appears beyond repair? </body>

      <description>The Chinese boss who had a novel approach to quality control</description>

      <body>I will never forget my first encounter with the Chinese business leader Zhang Ruimin almost 10 years ago. There, in a glass case in the boardroom of his company Haier was a sledgehammer, not something you normally encounter in corporate surroundings. But Mr Zhang is no ordinary chief executive, as I was reminded in another meeting a month or two ago in his now rather more elaborate headquarters in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The sledgehammer has been removed to the new corporate museum, something that Chinese businesses are very keen on. But though the story has been frequently told, it is still a good way to explain the remarkable company Zhang Ruimin has created over the past 28 years. The Qingdao Refrigerator Plant was close to failure when Mr Zhang was sent in at the end of 1984. Production at the time was at a low ebb, and there was no money to pay the staff. Mr Zhang borrowed some cash from a countryside workers' co-operative, and set about seeing what could be done about the disastrous state of the company his municipal employers had sent him into. Early notices (now on display in the company museum) banned urination and defecation in the factory. Pretty soon Mr Zhang was confronted with complaints from fridge buyers. In response, he gathered the workers in a yard outside the plant, and in front of them 76 substandard fridges were smashed to pieces. A quality quest to revive the plant started from that symbolic sledgehammer attack. And it worked. Qingdao has historic links with Germany; the city's Tsingtao beer - originally brewed by German expats - is now sold all over the world. So echoing its German partner Leibherr, the fridge business adopted a new name - Haier. Then began a remarkable expansion which has turned it into one of the few current Chinese global brands. With 80,000 employees across the globe, it is now one of the biggest manufacturers of white goods in the world. And when you listen to Zhang Ruimin talking about what he has done, you begin to realise that this is not just a dramatic story about a sledgehammer approach to corporate quality. Using a canny blend of Western management thinking and ancient Eastern ideas, Mr Zhang has created a management philosophy which is deep-seated and far-seeing. At first sight, it might seem to be management jargon plus Confucius, Taoism and Sun Tzu's Art of War all jumbled up. But Mr Zhang has developed some potent insights of his own into how a company might evolve in the face of huge new global challenges. And he is still developing them. "I believe in getting the best of both worlds, both from Chinese culture and from the West," says Mr Zhang. "The good thing about Chinese culture is that it treats something as a whole system, the forest not just the trees. You can see this in the difference of approach of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. "Western medicine treats symptoms; traditional Chinese medicine treats the whole body, holistically. Western culture wants everything quantified... so we have also adopted some Western management concepts." "Last week, I was talking to a marketing guru in the US and he told me, 'Good companies meet demands, great companies create demands.' We want to be a great company." Zhang Ruimin set out for me the evolution of his management ideas. "In the 1980s we mostly learned from Japanese companies," he says. "In the 1990s, we learned from American companies: General Electric's Six Sigma insistence on quality, for example. "But now we have incorporated many of those best practices into building our own innovative business model. It's called the win-win model, aligning employee goals with user needs." So (for example) Haier is trying to use the internet to put customers in touch with the people who make the goods, and workers in touch with the product-people who design them. But doing this is hard work. "We're still in a trial and error period and we're still exploring new models," says Mr Zhang. "In the past we had examples to follow but now we are in uncharted territory." Zhang Ruimin calls this "management without leaders". Workers are supposed to be led by the consumers of the things they make. He adds: "The most difficult thing is that in the past the employees would listen to their bosses, but now they don't have any bosses they have to listen to the users." To make this practical, Haier has broken down its 80,000 workforce into hundreds of internal micro companies, each with a profit and loss account even when they are only supplying internal corporate customers. Employees with a good idea are encouraged to find a team to develop it and get it made. Another striking Haier innovation is "catfish management". In fact it's an acknowledgement that there are still leaders even in a so-called leaderless organisation. They may be a bit paranoid, though. It's explained like this: in the sea, a lone catfish creates a commotion when it swims near a school of other fish. Live salmon are transported to market with a catfish in the tank, to keep them active and lively. Haier gives each of its many division bosses a "catfish" shadow manager, who is poised to take over if the man or woman in charge falters. Three months of missed targets, and the catfish deposes the leaders he or she has been shadowing. Sounds ruthless, but the manager (of air conditioners) who I heard from thought it reasonable and even stimulating. Not sure whether Mr Zhang has a catfish, though. When Zhang Ruimin was busy creating waves at Haier in the 1980s and '90s, the great Chinese industrial revolution was changing the whole global landscape. The country was becoming the industrial production house for the world. But most new Chinese companies were making things ordered, devised and designed by Western companies. They made what other people wanted from them. Haier wanted to export its own goods itself... quite a different philosophy, though fridges and washing machines were not exactly state of the art technology. Something else stands out about Haier's export strategy: the company started off in the developed, tough Western markets - Germany, the USA. Mr Zhang says: "Most Chinese companies would choose the other way, the easy markets first and then the more difficult ones later. Many of them started with Africa and South East Asia because those markets had lower expectations of quality. "But we decided to enter the German market first, and people thought we were crazy. "But we tried an experiment. We said, 'Let's put German products and Haier products together and take out the brand and let people see which one is the worst... we hoped it wasn't us.' "We wanted to set the standards high and thus force us to solve all the problems and to meet those high standards. "The Chinese people say, 'If you want to play chess, you need to play it with the master,' because that's the only way you learn." </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>
      <date>1382482853</date>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>How one town was shaped by silk</title>
      <description>How a luxury thread shaped a northern town</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24623315</url>

      <body>Silk production helped drive global trade, industrial development and social change. But it also shaped one British town that has been home to its production for four centuries. I moved to Macclesfield in Cheshire just over 10 years ago, and it did not take long before the seemingly endless references to silk had me grinding my teeth. From chip shops (the Silktown Fryer) to dentists (Silk Dental Care), the football team (the Silkmen) to the radio station (Silk 106.9), there seemed to be a tedious obligation to be branded with the word. Some businesses got oh-so-clever, with one restaurant changing the I to a Y to make Sylk in order to stand out from the crowd. Genius. Soon, though, the irritation was replaced by curiosity and then fascination as it became increasingly clear just what a profound effect the silk industry had in shaping the town. Many of the old weavers' cottages are still standing, as are a number of the 70-plus mills that once dominated the landscape. I walk my children to school down Lyon Street, named to mark the connection to France's greatest silk centre, while other streets bear the names of the major mill owners whose influence, benign or otherwise, shaped every aspect of the lives of the thousands of people they employed. Silk brought with it regular work, for women especially, and its presence in Macclesfield also heralded the birth of its social infrastructure, as cotton and wool did in other industrial towns. As Prof Jeremy Black from the University of Essex said: "One of the interesting aspects of industrial society, particularly in the north of England, is the development of what we call social capital. The factories and the workforces and the owners are not simply involved in a work relationship, they're also trying to create a new environment - for example, the growth of churches and the growth in particular in education. "By the end of the 19th Century you have great civic foundations with lots of local philanthropy, mostly from the new industrial orders. So what one has is a more purposed social capital, desired and designed to try and improve the nature of society. Whether you were on the left or the right, it ceased to be appropriate to say, 'I want things to be as they were 100 years ago.'" Things really begin to get interesting when you pull back the lens and see just how influential silk has been across the world. Since a Chinese empress supposedly dropped a cocoon into her hot tea and started to tease out the single thread of silk that came loose, the smoothest of luxury materials has provided a status symbol for the rich and powerful. It has also helped play midwife to the anarchist movement in its earliest days, and pushed forward technological change - from the development of arguably the world's first computer, in the shape of the Jacquard loom and the investigation into Mendelian genetics at the beginning of the 20th Century to the creation of state-of-the-art medical implants at the beginning of this one. Silk also provides economists with the earliest model of a globalised industry, according to Debin Ma of the London School of Economics. "There were other materials like coffee and ceramics but these came later. Silk was global early on for simple reasons, especially silk thread, because it's easily packed and bundled, and has extremely high value. In old times when transportation costs were very high and travel very dangerous, if you managed to bring a little bit of silk with you it's very profitable," he said. And these high profits made competition fierce, with the big silk-producing nations often dependent on political disquiet elsewhere for their own well-being. Although silk had been processed in the UK for centuries, it was only once the French revolutionaries banned silk in France that British centres like Macclesfield really had the opportunity to flourish. That is really when the town established itself as the nation's silk powerhouse, with most of the population making their living on the back of it. When Napoleon came to power, however, he rejected the revolutionary puritanism and became a powerful patron of French silk. The resulting downturn in Macclesfield led people there to take their knowledge and skills across the Atlantic and found the American industry in Paterson, New Jersey. The powerful expansion of silk across the globe has been in retreat for some time. Attempts at local production of the raw material, spearheaded by leaders such as James I in England, Henry IV in France and President John Quincy Adams in America, all ultimately failed. Nowadays, most production of the silk itself takes place once again in India and China, though many people there are heading to the cities and turning their backs on the hard labour involved in raising silkworms and harvesting their silk. There are still plenty of people prepared to spend £200 for a scarf or £90 for a tie made from pure silk, and the luxury end of the market remains resilient. Back in Macclesfield, two companies continue to produce thousands of metres of finished silk products every year, and the connection with the industry that has been here for four centuries and counting helps lend the town a coherence - and for its residents, a meaningful sense of identity. So anyone thinking of opening a bar or a bookies with the word silk in its name - go ahead. I'll be among the first through the doors. Just as long as you don't try to get too fancy and use the letter Y instead of an I. There's nothing smooth about that. Silk will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 23 October at 11.00 BST or listen again on iPlayer. </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <body>The economy of Burma, officially called Myanmar, is open for business. That's the message the reformist government of President Thein Sein is sending out, and it has got an overwhelmingly positive response from investors. But behind the impressive headline figures of planned ventures and promised aid, who is actually doing well in the new Burma? There have been some high-profile announcements - Nissan and Suzuki want to manufacture cars, Ford has opened a dealership, Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But many foreign investors are waiting both for infrastructure to improve and for greater political certainty before jumping in. The indigenous Burmese business community, on the other hand, has been a hive of activity. Inevitably, the companies best placed to profit from the new opportunities are the so-called cronies - those who built up their businesses through close co-operation with the old military regime. Despite still being listed on US sanctions lists, with their resources and experience, they are winning many of the new infrastructure contracts. Smaller companies, though, are cashing in on booming demand for property, consumer goods and services. Wai Thit Lwin, a graduate from Berkeley in her 20s, juggles looking after her two young daughters, expanding a local chain of 50 convenience stores, and helping manage a company that operates hospitals, hotels, and markets brands such as Sony and LG in Burma. Everything she is involved in is growing fast. Her main concerns? The inadequacy of Burma's banking system - local companies have to pay punishing interest rates for capital - and the threat of competition from the convenience store giant 7-11. Then there was Cho Thet Nwe, who left school to help bring up her brothers, but is now the brand manager for the French cosmetics company L'Oreal. "When we started selling European products here in 1996, it was so difficult," she recalls. "Back then the whole family would use the same soap, from head to toe. We were trying to sell facial foams and shampoo - we had to start educating them from zero. But now lifestyles have changed tremendously." One of the most conspicuous improvements in consumer choice is the availability of mobile phones. When I first reported from Burma 12 years ago only a tiny elite were allowed to buy mobiles. The phones themselves were heavy, ancient, first generation models. Today Sim cards are available, although still in limited numbers and for a much higher price than in neighbouring countries. And you can buy pretty much any model of phone, from the numerous, glaringly lit shops in Rangoon (also known as Yangon). Myat Thiri Khaing studied Chinese at university, intending to work as a translator. Instead she joined one of Burma's first phone retailers, Lu Gyi Min, excited by the possibilities of technology. Today she is the manager of the busy Latha Street branch, doing evening classes in management to improve her chances of promotion. The business is growing quickly, she told me, especially outside Rangoon, where they have plans to open more branches. But amid these positive stories, the majority of Burmese have yet to feel any material benefits from the reforms. And there are some who feel they are losing out in this new and unpredictable environment. A few kilometres from downtown Rangoon is south Dagon, designated an industrial zone back in the days of military rule. Part of it is given over to rows of small iron foundries, operating the most primitive technology. Sweat-grimed workers pull glowing strips of metal from open furnaces, and toss them expertly to others who catch them with tongs, and run them through clattering presses. I met U Mitthya, who assembles small pick-up trucks, his workers welding them by hand. In the days of military rule, when car imports were tightly restricted, it was a good business. Now as inexpensive vehicle imports flood in, it is no longer a viable business. He said the three trucks in his workshop were probably the last he would make. The big plans to expand Burma's industrial base have caused casualties too. The most ambitious project is a planned industrial estate next to the port of Thilawa, south of Rangoon, to provide an area of reliable power and suitable infrastructure for Japanese manufacturers. But this requires moving the people who have been living on the land for many years. Daw Htay Htay and a few of her neighbours say that under military rule they had been forced to give up their land for paltry compensation. But as the planned project never took off, they simply carried on cultivating it. Now the government wants to start construction of Thilawa, as early as the end of this year. It has offered the value of six years' rice harvests, and an alternative plot of land. Daw Htay Htay says she is being put under pressure by officials to accept, but feels the compensation is not enough. In this time of change, she told me: "I feel it is only we who are losing." But it is not only her. Land disputes have erupted all over the country, as new economic opportunities make previously worthless land valuable again. This is an emotional issue, with the potential to overshadow much of the good news that is coming out of Burma these days. </body>

As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <title>UK QE has failed, says QE inventor</title>
      <description>Where did the phrase 'quantitative easing' come from?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614016</url>

      <body>When the UK embarked on quantitative easing (QE) in March 2009, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Bank of England was expected to administer a monetary stimulus equal to £50bn, writes Liam Halligan. Over the past four years, such "extraordinary measures" have extended somewhat more, with the Bank's bond-buying programme now amounting to £375bn - almost eight times the original estimate. Since the financial crisis began, the Bank of England's balance sheet has expanded four-fold. But where did the phrase "quantitative easing" come from? Arguably among the most controversial economic policies of recent years, QE is surely the most unpronounceable. Not many Western analysts are aware that this tongue-challenging name originated in Japan, the modern-day spiritual home of money-printing. Even fewer know that the man who coined the phrase comes from Germany - which, of all the big Western economies, has probably the most deep-seated aversion to printing money. In the mid-1990s, Prof Richard Werner, a German academic fluent in Japanese, was working as an economist in Tokyo. Japan's real estate bubble had burst and property and share prices were tumbling. The country was locked in a debate about the use of unconventional monetary policy to support asset prices and boost broader commercial activity. Prof Werner submitted an article to Nikkei, a leading business newspaper, advocating a new type of radical monetary measure. Rather than attempting to shift interest rates, he argued that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan should instead intervene directly to influence the size of the money supply by taking steps to encourage commercial banks to extend more credit. "I was promoting a policy that involved more credit creation, rather than changing the price of money," says Prof Werner. "So when I wrote my article, and after the newspaper's editors insisted on a phrase readers would understand, I added the Japanese adjective for quantity to the standard expression for monetary stimulation. 'Quantitative easing' was the literal translation back into English of these two Japanese words." Prof Werner's article was widely noticed. Several years later, in fact, the Bank of Japan decided to implement extreme monetary measures and adopted the Japanese name the German economist had coined. "In 2001, the Japanese central bank said, 'Now we're actually doing this'," he recalls. "To communicate this to global markets, they had to give the policy a name in English. I suppose the translators had a bad day, or were under time pressure. Normally, you'd try to come up with something slightly more fluent than 'quantitative easing', but they did only a literal translation." While the Bank of Japan adopted the precise name of Prof Werner's policy, it was somewhat less accurate when interpreting his actual proposal. Incredibly, the Japanese version of QE that was eventually implemented was a policy Prof Werner had specifically ruled-out. Prof Werner's argument was that, because more than 95% of the money supply in a modern economy is derived not from cash or reserves, but from private bank lending, it is essential to get banks to lend. So he urged the Japanese government to enter into private long-term agreements to borrow from commercial banks, instead of issuing government debt. The Bank of Japan's version of QE, in contrast, involved creating money out of nothing at the central bank. "That's absolutely not what my policy was about," says Prof Werner. "In my original article, I specifically argued against either lowering interest rates or expanding central bank reserves. That was my whole point - traditional solutions weren't going to work. Actually, it was a bit upsetting." Then, in an additional twist, the Bank of England also later adopted Prof Werner's QE label - but, again, to describe a policy with which he didn't agree. "It was one thing when the Bank of Japan did it, because that was over in Japan and was some time ago," he says. "But once the Bank of England also started using the phrase, I thought 'Hang on - I've got to speak up and make clear that the original definition is quite different.'" The Bank of England's interpretation of QE also involves the creation of central bank credits, as in Japan. But in the UK these have been used to buy government bonds from commercial banks rather than from the government directly. Prof Werner says this is "a little better" than Japanese QE, as it "at least in theory increases commercial banks' reserves". He maintains, though, that the "best way to boost the economy is to increase bank credit", and that can only be guaranteed by governments borrowing from banks directly. "That creates new credit," says Prof Werner. "The money supply then expands, transactions increase, there's more demand, more employment, more tax revenues and suddenly you have a virtuous circle." In both Japan and the UK, QE isn't working, he says, because it doesn't focus on "the most important part of the money supply", which is bank lending. "UK QE has singularly failed, as bank credit is still shrinking." When faced with the claim used by some British banks that the demand for credit is low, Prof Werner is dismissive. "I'm quite used to this argument, because banks in Japan used it for 20 years," he says. "The banks, of course, have become very risk-averse, as they have many non-performing assets." Prof Werner is also critical of the UK's concentrated banking structure - which he argues has made the economy more vulnerable. "British banking is dominated by a small number of big banks - with just five banks controlling 90% of deposits," he says. "Big banks want to lend to big firms and do big deals that give big bonuses. Small firms are too much hassle, and the banks are absolutely not interested - even though small firms need the credit and account for 70% of UK employment. So these small firms are credit-rationed and that's a problem." "In Germany, 70% of deposits are held by 2,000 banks," says Prof Werner. "These local German banks lend a lot more to small- and medium-sized firms, and when the credit crunch happened most of them were fine." When it comes to QE, although his policy recommendations have been misinterpreted in Japan, the UK and elsewhere, Prof Werner maintains his natural sense of humour about giving the world a phrase that's so challenging to say. "It's become a household name anyway and I should get some kind of fee, some royalties, for that," he says with a smile. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>
      <date>1382520781</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70652000/jpg/_70652651_fb.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>Ebay aims for one-hour delivery</title>
      <description>Ebay announces it will acquire start-up Shutl as it aims to bring one-hour delivery to the UK.</description>

      <body>Ebay has announced it is to acquire start-up Shutl in a bid to bring one-hour delivery to the UK. The service will be offered when both seller and buyer are in the same area. The online auction site already has a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes, with Shutl, to add more than 20 other US cities next year. The UK service will start in London. Speedy delivery is seen as a key growth area for retailers, with rivals such as Amazon also rolling out new services. Its AmazonFresh offering, which is so far only available in Los Angeles or Seattle, sources products from grocery shops, restaurants and other local businesses - essentially acting as a enhanced courier service. Other start-ups such as San Francisco-based Instacart promise the same, although its approach is not to have any direct tie-up with retailers. "Today, approximately 75% of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home," said eBaymarketplaces president Devin Wenig in a statement announcing the Shutl acquisition. "Traditional retail isn't going away. But it is transforming, and that creates enormous opportunity within the $10 trillion total commerce market." No financial details of the deal were disclosed by either company. Shutl already operates in the UK, counting retailers such as Schuh, Warehouse and Argos among its clients. It allows customers to choose as-soon-as-possible delivery - its record is just under 14 minutes - or to select a one-hour window in which to receive the goods. Using rapid delivery comes at a cost - Shutl adds an extra £6.99 to some products if they are needed quickly. Founder and chief executive Tom Allason said that Shutl would continue to work with all its existing partners, but would expand to accommodate eBay's plans. "E-commerce is quick and convenient, two things that delivery is not," wrote Mr Allason. "Together with eBay, we believe that we can transform this market and fulfil our mission." </body>

      <title>Google Chrome adds parental controls</title>
      <description>Google's web browser, Chrome, introduces controls that allow parents to monitor their children's browsing history and block certain websites.</description>

      <body>Google has introduced controls to its Chrome web browser that allow parents to monitor and control the browsing behaviour of their children. The new feature, called "supervised users", allows "managers" to set up profiles of the people they want to monitor. Managers can view the supervised users' browsing history, block specific sites, and approve access requests. The feature is available on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. It is also available to Chromebook users. But Google says the default setting is to allow a newly created supervised user to view all websites - managers have to specify what sites they want to block. SafeSearch is activated automatically for supervised users, preventing most adult content from appearing in Google search results. The move comes after growing concerns over inappropriate content children can be exposed to online. Other browsers, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, offer content controls that can be set by an administrator. Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system enables users to set up a "Kid's Corner" section on the phone that only allows access to specified games, music, videos and apps. Kids are unable to access disallowed websites. A recent survey found that many youngsters aged nine to 11 were engaging in risky behaviour online, such as sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, including the 18-rated Call of Duty series. ISC2, an organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety, also found that 43% of youngsters went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours online every time they did so. Another survey, by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, found that 69% of teachers and 40% of young people thought online safety should be taught in more schools and included in the national curriculum. </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of computers already running any version of OS X released since 2009. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about £100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. Chromebook computers also get free upgrades for Google's PC operating system. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <title>Nokia reveals phablets and tablets</title>
      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24608498</url>

      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; £4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Critics dismiss new data legislation</title>
      <description>Major new European data-protection laws may have serious loopholes, say critics.</description>

      <body>Critics have said new European data-protection laws have loopholes that could render the legislation useless. The rules are the first attempt to create strong data-protection laws for Europe's 500 million citizens. They include a clause to strengthen online privacy in the wake of whistleblower Edward Snowden's allegations about US spying. They also set out ways citizens can erase their personal data - the so-called right to be forgotten. Lawmakers have toughened the initial draft regulation, prepared by the European Commission, to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty. This is a direct response to allegations from former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency (NSA) snooping on European citizens' data. Another clause seeks to limit user profiling, requiring companies to explain their use of personal data in detail to customers and to seek prior consent. To ensure that the regulation is properly applied, most businesses would have to designate or hire data-protection officers. After 18 months of fierce industry lobbying, the legislation was passed with a 49-3 committee vote, with one abstention. The European Parliament still needs to hold another vote and seek agreement with the EU's 28 member states though — which is likely to result in some changes. "Tonight's vote sends a clear signal - as of today, data protection is made in Europe," said EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding. But French consumer group La Quadrature du Net was disappointed with the draft law. "There are some big loopholes that could void the effectiveness of the whole legislation," said Jeremie Zimmermann, from the organisation. He said vague wording such as "legitimate interest" could allow businesses to "exonerate themselves from the legislation". "A business could say that it is a legitimate interest to collect data in order to provide a better service for consumers or to enable it to make money," he said. He was also surprised that the rules around data profiling were not tougher. "Machines that crunch data are used to make important decisions such as who can get a job, who can get a loan, who can get insurance," he said. "This legislation allows firms to continue to collect and process more data and profile individuals." Bridget Treacy, partner and head of UK privacy and cyber-security at law firm, Hunton and Williams thinks that companies will have to ring the changes in order to comply with the legislation. "It enhances consumer rights and means businesses are going to have to focus on making sure they know what data they've got and what they do with it," she said. "One of the requirements of the legislation is that companies only collect the minimum amount of data that they require for a specific purpose. Firms are going to have to be much clearer about what data they are collecting and why." "It means that they will not be able to hold on to data as a bit of a comfort blanket," she added. Companies that fail to comply with the new law could be subject to a fine of up to 5% of their annual turnover — which could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a few billion dollars for internet giants such as Google. Now begins a long process during which the approved legislation will be debated among between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. It is expected to be concluded in March. </body>

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Blackberry resumes BBM rollout</title>
      <description>Blackberry announces it is resuming the rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and iPhone after September's botched launch.</description>

      <body>Blackberry has resumed a phased rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and Apple devices after September's botched launch. The free app is now available for download on Google Play, the App Store and selected Samsung App Stores. But users had to register an email address after downloading the app then wait in line until they were told they could begin using it, Blackberry said. Last month Blackberry had to delay the launch after the software was leaked. The company said that "in just seven hours [following the leak], about one million Android users were using the unreleased version of BBM for Android". This had caused unspecified "issues" for the launch, it said. About six million people had signed up for information abut BBM at BBM.com, the company said. "To help manage this unprecedented pent-up demand for BBM, we are implementing a simple line-up system to ensure a smooth rollout," wrote company spokesman Andrew Bocking. Those who had already signed up for information about BBM were able to start using the app straight away, he said. Others would have to wait in line, but the company did not specify how long the wait might be. The botched launch was the latest in a run of bad news for the struggling Canadian firm, which is cutting 4,500 jobs, made a net loss of $965m (£600m) in the second quarter of 2013, and has agreed a $4.7bn sale to a consortium led by Fairfax Financial. Blackberry has failed to keep pace with Apple and devices running Google Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems. In September, there were reports that it was exiting the consumer market to concentrate on providing services to business customers - reports it has since played down. But the Blackberry Messenger product - known as BBM - has proved very popular, particularly with younger users. The software offers an alternative to SMS messages - which cost money on some subscription plans - as well as other voice and screen-sharing capabilities. </body>

      <title>Cyber defence unit 'may use hackers'</title>
      <description>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, says the head of the new unit.</description>

      <body>Convicted computer hackers could be recruited to the UK's cyber defence force if they pass security vetting, the head of the new unit has said. Lt Col Michael White told BBC Newsnight he would "look at individuals in the round" when assessing applicants. Recruitment would be focused on "capability development" rather than "personality traits", he added. The Joint Cyber Reserve Unit was announced by the government in September. Under the £500m initiative, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is set to recruit hundreds of reservists as computer experts to work alongside regular armed forces. The unit will defend national security by safeguarding computer networks and vital data, and it will also launch strikes in cyberspace if necessary. It is hoped the move will address the shortage of people with the technological skills and knowledge to protect corporations, the military, and government systems from cyber attacks. The MoD said the recruitment, which started in early October, would target regular personnel leaving the armed forces, current and former reservists with the required skills, and civilians with the appropriate technological knowledge. When asked by Newsnight whether someone with the right skills would be ruled out if they had a criminal record for hacking, Lt Col White said: "I think if they could get through the security process, then if they had that capability that we would like, then if the vetting authority was happy with that, why not? "We're looking at capability development, rather than setting hard and fast rules about individual personality traits." Defence Secretary Philip Hammond unveiled plans for the cyber defence unit last month. Mr Hammond also told Newsnight he could foresee circumstances in which convicted hackers could be employed. "Each individual case would be looked at on its merits," he said. "The conviction would be examined in terms of how long ago it was, how serious it was, what sort of sentence had followed. So I can't rule it out." But one former hacker told Newsnight the government had already undermined its chances of attracting talented individuals. Mustafa al-Bassam, now a computer science student at King's College London, was the youngest hacker in the Lulzsec group - which recently targeted organisations such as the FBI in the US and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) in a 50-day hacking campaign. He told the BBC that revelations by former US contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of mass surveillance carried out by intelligence agencies - including the US' National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ - had dissuaded him from using his cyber skills to protect UK national security. "I can understand the need for a government to protect itself, but when you go ahead and stomp on everyone's civil liberties - as we've seen with all the mass surveillance stories that have been out over the past year - I think you can rest assured that you're going to repel talented people," he said. Dr David Day, a Sheffield Hallam University computer forensics expert who provided evidence for Mr Al-Bassam's conviction, told Newsnight it was a "terrible shame" someone convicted of malicious hacking would find it difficult to get a job in the industry. "If they have those abilities and those skills, then some of the best talent we can't use," he said. Cyber attacks and crime have become more common in recent years. In July, it emerged Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber espionage operations a month against government or industry networks, GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban told the BBC business secrets were being stolen on an "industrial scale". And in a written statement in December last year, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said 93% of large corporations and 76% of small businesses had reported a cyber breach in 2012.

      <title>Wikipedia in fake entries probe</title>
      <description>Editors of the English-language Wikipedia site express "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of paid-for entries.</description>

      <body>Wikipedia editors have expressed "shock and dismay" at the discovery of hundreds of user accounts set up to make paid-for entries. Paid-for advocacy and the adoption of fake "sockpuppet" identities for promotional purposes are against the free web encyclopaedia's policies. Sue Gardner, executive editor of the Wikimedia Foundation, said "as many as several hundred" accounts were suspect. Editors have blocked or banned more than 250 accounts, she added. "Our goal is to provide neutral, reliable information for our readers, and anything that threatens that is a serious problem," said Ms Gardner. "We are actively examining this situation and exploring our options." Wikipedia considers paid-for advocacy a "black hat" practice, she said, that "violates the core principles that have made Wikipedia so valuable for so many people." The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organisation that operates Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia. According to investigations by the service's editors, most of the disputed entries appear to originate from a US company called Wiki-PR, which claims to "build, manage, and translate Wikipedia pages for over 12,000 people and companies." The editors say promotional entries - which were posted by an account called "Morning227" as well as by others - have been commissioned by Silicon Valley dot-coms, small financial institutions, authors, medical doctors, a musician and an oil company, amongst others. Citations are taken from a number of blog-like websites that accept "citizen journalist" material, including CrunchBase, DigitalJournal.com and Technorati.com. Entries "often have a promotional tone and always contain material that is either neutral or that is flattering of their subjects, never material that is critical or negative," Wikipedia said. However, Wiki-PR disputed the idea it had broken Wikipedia's rules by promoting or advertising its clients' agendas, saying it merely wanted to ensure they were "presented accurately" on the site. "The PR in Wiki-PR is a misnomer - we're a research and writing firm," Jordan French, the firm's chief executive, told the BBC. "We research the subject and write in an accurate and properly referenced way about it, filling a hole at Wikipedia for many subjects - concepts, companies, people, even astronomy - in which other editors lack an interest. "We're part of the fabric of Wikipedia - an integral part - and useful where volunteers don't want to or cannot put in the time to understand a subject, find sources, code, upload, and professionally monitor a page.

      <title>Obama addresses healthcare glitches</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama acknowledges widespread technical issues that have plagued the rollout of a major element of his 2010 healthcare law.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has said there is "no excuse" for the glitches that have plagued the rollout of an element of his 2010 healthcare law. At the White House, Mr Obama said that despite their problems, the insurance enrolment websites were enabling people to sign up for affordable coverage. Those attempting to sign up for health insurance have reported persistent issues since the 1 October rollout. Mr Obama said a "tech surge" was under way to fix the snags. The website's issues have been overshadowed by the recent partial government shutdown, in which Republican lawmakers attempted to gut the law through budgetary brinkmanship. 'No sugar coating' In Monday's Rose Garden event, Mr Obama conceded that healthcare.gov "hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work". "The number of people who've visited the site has been overwhelming, which has aggravated some of these underlying problems." Mr Obama added: "There's no sugar coating - the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am." He said that notwithstanding the website's problems, there was "massive demand" and the homepage had been visited nearly 20 million times since its launch. "Precisely because the product is good, I want the cash registers to work; I want the checkout lines to be smooth," said Mr Obama. "And there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed." He was joined at Monday's event by people who have successfully enrolled during the first three weeks. Janice Baker, a Delaware business owner who was the first person in her state to enrol for coverage through the exchange website, introduced Mr Obama. She said she had "a number of frustrating attempts" to use the site, but kept trying as she had been rejected from insurance plans previously because of a pre-existing condition. Ms Baker said she expected to save $150 (£93) a month with the policy she had signed up for on the exchange. The website is supposed to be a clearinghouse for uninsured Americans searching for medical coverage. The site acts both as a check on whether applications qualify for government subsidies for private insurance, as well as being the first enrolment step for specific plans. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the exchanges will be the gateway for providing health coverage to an estimated seven million Americans during the first year. The White House has said almost half a million people have applied for healthcare through both federal and state-run exchanges since 1 October. Exchanges run by individual states do not appear to have been plagued to the same extent by malfunctions. White House officials initially blamed the glitches on the heavy volume of visits to the site, but they recently conceded the flaws were larger and involved software and system design issues. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the exchanges, said in a blog post it had already begun to make improvements. But the administration has offered few details on who was being brought in from outside the government and the specific causes of the ongoing glitches. Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has rolled out in multiple steps, including coverage requirements on insurance companies and future tax penalties for those who remain uninsured. Republicans unanimously oppose the law and have worked to undermine it since it was enacted. Republican-led state governments have used their authority to frustrate its implementation. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to repeal the law or eliminate its funding, most recently by refusing to pass a budget in an attempt to force Mr Obama's hand. A subsequent 16-day shutdown of the federal government ended with no major concessions from Mr Obama. "Obamacare costs too much and it's not working the way they promised," Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday. "It's time for the president to consider delaying this rushed effort." Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has also been criticised by Republican lawmakers for declining an invitation to testify about the snags on 24 October. But a spokeswoman for the health department said the secretary would testify at some point. White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Monday there had been "for many months and years now a concentrated, concerted effort by critics of Obamacare to undermine it". "There's clearly some joy being taken in some quarters by the experiences that some Americans have had, frustrating experiences that they've had, in trying to get information about affordable health insurance." Although the law remains divisive, a recent Gallup poll suggests only 29% of the public favours a complete repeal. </body>

      <body>The latest Windows update is causing problems for owners of Microsoft's Surface RT gadgets. The Windows 8.1 update has reportedly meant some of the touchscreen devices will not start up properly. Microsoft has removed the update from its website while it looks into what has caused the problems. At the same time, many people are reporting that the 8.1 update for Internet Explorer does not work well with Outlook and some Google services. Soon after the update's global release, on 17 October, Microsoft started to receive reports that once it had been applied to RT tablets and laptops, the gadgets had frozen during the boot-up process. Windows RT is the version of Microsoft's operating system built to work with mobile and portable devices that use Arm chips. By contrast, other version of Windows run on machines that use processors from Intel or AMD. Soon after the problems were reported, Microsoft pulled Windows RT 8.1 from its update site. The update was pulled while it was "investigating a situation affecting a limited number of users", it explained in a support forum response. It added that it was working on a fix for the problem it had caused. Prior to the official release, Windows RT user Scott Williams found a way to help people with tablets crippled by the update. Mr Williams created a start-up drive with a USB stick that helped bring stricken RT gadgets back to life. The version of Internet Explorer 11 that ships with Windows 8.1 update has also caused problems for many people. The updated version of the web browser has caused Google search results to be mashed together at the left hand side of a display. Others have reported IE11 has caused similar usability problems with Google's Play website and Music service. In a statement, Microsoft said changes Google had made to its search and other sites were responsible for the glitches. Despite this, Microsoft has now made changes of its own to fix the problem, which can be turned on by unticking an option in IE11 that makes the browser use "Microsoft Compatibility lists". Microsoft has also issued advice about how to get IE11 working with web-accessible versions of its Outlook email program that had become unusable with the new version of the browser. </body>

      <title>Cheney: Heart implant hack credible</title>
      <description>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, reveals that he had his wireless heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack back in 2007.</description>

      <body>Dick Cheney, the former US vice-president, has revealed that he had his heart implant modified for fear of terrorist attack. Mr Cheney's doctor disabled the heart defibrillator's wireless function in 2007 to prevent would-be assassins from interfering with it and causing a fatal heart attack. A similar scenario featured in an episode of the hit TV series Homeland. "I found it credible," Mr Cheney told CBS TV's 60 Minutes programme. "I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible,'' said Mr Cheney, who was President George W Bush's right-hand man during the "war on terror". "Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can be vulnerable to a range of electronic signals," said Adrian Culley, global technical consultant for security company Damballa. "Research has been undertaken which shows it is entirely feasible to potentially exploit someone's ICD, given close proximity to the individual." But he said the chance of a successful attack on Mr Cheney would have been "slim". An ICD monitors heartbeat and if it detects an irregular rhythm, sends low-energy electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. In 2008, researchers from the University of Washington, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Harvard Medical School, claimed that they could carry out software radio-based attacks on ICDs that could "compromise patient safety and patient privacy". More recent research has also highlighted the security and data privacy weaknesses of some implantable medical devices. "Since the experiments in 2008, experts have acknowledged that greater security of these devices is required, and encryption has been introduced to prevent the loss of personal data," a spokesman for the Institute of Risk Management told the BBC. "As with all electronic devices, the possibility of targeted hacking still exists given the right physical situation, expert knowledge of the device and the necessary equipment. "However, it is much more likely that a strong electromagnetic field will cause the device to malfunction," he said. The American Heart Association warns ICD users against too much close-range exposure to a number of electronic devices, from mobile phones to metal detectors, retail security systems to powerful CB radios. But it points out that, in most cases, the risks are small. Cardiologist Jonathan Reiner has co-written a book with Mr Cheney called, Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, chronicling the former vice-president's many heart problems. Mr Reiner told 60 Minutes that on 11 September 2001, the day of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, the potassium in Mr Cheney's blood rose to levels that could have caused abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest - a condition called hyperkalemia. Mr Reiner feared the vice-president was going to die that night. Mr Cheney, 72, has a long history of heart troubles culminating in a heart transplant last year. </body>

      <body>A browser-based re-creation of the popular Super Mario Brothers console game has fallen foul of Nintendo's copyright lawyers, The Washington Post has reported. College student Josh Goldberg created the Full Screen Mario site in HTML 5 so people could play the game in a web browser rather than on a games console. But Nintendo has asked him to remove the content saying it infringes its "intellectual property rights". The game is still operational. Mr Goldberg, who admitted he did not get permission from Nintendo to re-create the game, said he began the project in October 2012 as a computer programming exercise. He "didn't care" about copyright issues because he "didn't think it would be a big project", he told the newspaper. But after little initial interest the game is now receiving 300,000 unique visitors a day, Mr Goldberg claims, after Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow blogged about it. Unfortunately for Mr Goldberg, the site's popularity also brought it to the attention of Nintendo's lawyers. "Nintendo's like Disney - it will not tolerate their characters being used on anything," said Keza MacDonald, UK games editor for IGN.com, the video game and entertainment site. "Earlier this year Nintendo stopped people posting footage of their games on YouTube, so this behaviour sounds entirely consistent." At the bottom of the site's home page the site declares: "Mario, Super Mario Brothers, and all associated games and media are property of Nintendo and/or Nintendo of America Inc., and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws." Super Mario Brothers was copyrighted by Nintendo in 1985, but under US law, corporate copyright lasts for 95 years. </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads. Ackeem has developed a wheel that can be manually adapted to suit different terrains. But will he reach his target, and develop the project which has become his obsession?

      <body>Britain's changing weather patterns have resulted in an increase in the number of landslides in recent years as the result of heavy summer and winter rainfall. Geologists from the British Geological Survey have been measuring landslides across the UK for almost 30 years and have created a database of every landslide reported. Inside Out's Marie Ashby meets the team based in Nottinghamshire which is using technology to predict future landslides to help reduce the risk of disasters. Recent events including a road slippage in Rothbury, Northumberland and a railway landslip at Stainforth, South Yorkshire illustrate the impact of landslips on communities. The collapse of a section of cliffs in Dorset also claimed the life of Charlotte Blackman from Derbyshire when she was on holiday a year ago. It is hoped new technology will allow the British Geological Survey team to link geology and weather to produce a daily landslide forecast and prevent similar accidents. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One East Midlands on Monday, 21 October at 19:30 GMT and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter.

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>
      <date>1382482853</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70648000/jpg/_70648920_70627703.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/jpg/_70645809_c0109978-emerald_ash_borer_on_a_leaf-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <title>First venomous crustacean found</title>
      <description>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves.</description>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Bristol are in line for up to £33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The £40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed £16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend £200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said the government had wasted the past three years. The opposition said only one project - the £700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date while, in total, work had only begun on one in five of infrastructure projects. "There's lots more that could be done but they just don't seem to have their heart in it," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. "The energy isn't there and there's a question of competence now about whether they can deliver on some of these infrastructure promises that they're making." Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. Business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. "Despite the scale of the UK Guarantee Scheme, only around a third of firms are aware of it, so this announcement will help raise awareness to other projects struggling to find finance," said the CBI's Rhian Kelly. "The government now needs to push more of these pre-qualification projects through the approval stage so that they can get off the drawing board." </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness.

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique.

      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <title>Jersey 'last home of Neanderthals'</title>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542753_c0177393-brain_scan%2C_conceptual_image-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <title>British forests under threat</title>
      <description>New global threats from pests and diseases could spell disaster for British forests, experts warn.</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>
      <description>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs."

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>Canine virus threatens Siberian tiger</title>
      <description>Dog virus is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24535799</url>
      <date>1382399856</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70502000/jpg/_70502776_z9340701-siberian_tiger_panthera_tigris_altaica_-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <body>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a servant for nearly a decade have been jailed. Ilyas and Tallat Ashar brought the girl, who is deaf, from Pakistan and kept her at their home in Eccles, Salford, where she slept in the cellar. Ilyas Ashar, 84, who was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, was jailed for 13 years at Manchester Crown Court. Tallat Ashar, 68, convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking, got five years. Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family. The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity. Ilyas Ashar was also found guilty of benefit fraud and trafficking. Judge Peter Lakin, sentencing, said the couple had not shown any remorse. He said: "You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. "You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. You exploited her physically, mentally and economically. "There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity - you two took that away from her, you consigned her to a life of misery and degradation." He added: "You are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people." The victim was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family and also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. The court heard a proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. The couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was given a 12-month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work after she was also found guilty of benefit fraud. The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned, the court heard. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language, enabling her to be interviewed by police. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said an appropriate name would be "Miss Courageous" after she spent 34 days in total being cross-examined. He said: "She is a remarkable young woman, a young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court." The passport used to allow the girl into the UK claimed she was 20, and it was a matter of "mystery and concern" how immigration officials at Heathrow did not spot the difference in age, he said. Those involved in her development since her discovery have described her progress like "a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis". </body>

      <body>A woman has been killed in a fall of about 80ft (24m) from the third floor of a clothes store in Liverpool. Merseyside Police said she was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor of Primark in Church Street, at 18:00 BST on Tuesday. The 57-year-old woman had been seen moments before at a balcony next to the third-floor escalators. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. The coroner has been informed. She was treated by a doctor at the scene but was pronounced dead later at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. An North West Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the drop from the third-floor escalators was about 80ft. Liverpool City Council, which has health and safety responsibilities for the city's shops, said it was waiting for the results of police inquiries before deciding whether to investigate. Primark has not been available for comment. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later. Five years ago, at the same store, a three-year-old girl fell through a gap between the escalators to the lower ground floor while travelling up to the third floor with her family. She broke her left leg and arm and suffered internal injuries but survived. </body>

      <body>An MP has helped rescue a woman from the River Thames after seeing what he thought was a dead body float past him. Stephen Gilbert, MP for St Austell and Newquay, was at an event at the House of Commons terrace, overlooking the Thames, on Tuesday night. The Liberal Democrat said: "What looked like a body just floated past. Then I saw that the person then moved and I followed them down the terrace." He threw a lifebelt which the woman caught before being pulled out. The RNLI and Marine Police rescued her from the water near Westminster Pier. Mr Gilbert said: "There are some lifebuoys on the terrace, I guess this is not the first time something like this has happened." He added the shock had left him "barely able to string a sentence together". After the rescue he tweeted: "Shaken after seeing a body float past House of Commons terrace - she moved, I threw a life-buoy and she's now been rescued! #Result." The woman was taken to hospital. </body>

      <title>Firefighter cuts 'will risk lives'</title>
      <description>Lives will be put at risk if the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service cuts a fifth of firefighter jobs to save £8m, a union warns.</description>

      <body>Lives will be put at risk if plans to cut one in five firefighter jobs go ahead, a union has said. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue is planning to axe 131 posts, shut three stations and cut the number of engines from 30 to 24 in a bid to save £8m. Chief officer Tom Capeling said crews would "try their utmost" to stop lives being put at risk, but said response times would be slower. The Fire Brigades Union said the proposals were "devastating". Union secretary Dave Turner said areas would also be left without cover "for extended periods" if plans to shut Gosforth, Wallsend and Sunderland stations are approved. The service, which will hold a consultation into the plans, needs to reduce its spending because of government cuts over the next three years. Mr Capeling said: "Ultimately there will be an impact - we will be getting to incidents more slowly. "If someone is in a fire we will try our utmost to get to them as quickly as possible but if six fire engines are removed from an area like Tyne and Wear it will take longer to get there. "We will get to incidents slower, it will be marginally slower, but when there is a risk to life we will try to be as quick as we are today." The service is planning to build a new central station to cover Gosforth and Wallsend. Mr Turner said: "These are the most devastating cuts in the service's history and will mean firefighters and the public will be at far greater risk. "It also means that areas will be left without cover for extended periods increasing the risk to both the public and firefighters." </body>

      <body>A man found guilty of murdering his former landlord after shooting him through the heart with a crossbow in a row over a drugs debt has been jailed for life. Russell Gill, 42, of Lavender Walk, Aylesbury, was convicted by a majority verdict of murdering Darrell Farnham, 44, at his Belgrave Road home in June. Reading Crown Court heard Gill had a drugs habit and owed Mr Farnham £6,000. Gill was told he must serve at least 24 years. He had admitted manslaughter but denied murder, claiming Mr Farnham's death was an accident. During the trial, the court heard Mr Farnham was shot at point-blank range through the heart on 23 June and bled to death on his doorstep. The jury was told Gill used to buy amphetamine from Mr Farnham, running up a debt. The prosecution said that on the day of the killing, Gill heard Mr Farnham had been making threats to kill him so took a crossbow and a samurai sword to the victim's home. Police later found Mr Farnham collapsed on the floor with blood on his chest, holding a crossbow bolt in his outstretched hand. Gill was arrested four days later and told police he had only intended to scare Mr Farnham but the victim's dog had attacked him during the argument and the crossbow had gone off by mistake. The prosecution said it was a clinical execution of a man he had come to hate. After the verdict, Det Sup Chris Ward from Thames Valley Police called the offence a "pre-planned brutal murder" using "the most lethal of weapons imaginable". "The victim….had no way of defending himself against this attack," he said. In a statement, Mr Farnham's family said they were "satisfied" with the verdict. "Gill has shown no remorse or sadness for this terrible act but attempted throughout the trial to justify his actions and destroy the reputation of Darrell, thus causing further distress to family members," it said. "Darrell was a larger than life character, always there for his family and friends and his death has touched everyone he knew. "[He] will never be forgotten but we can now start to move forward and rebuild our lives." </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police are appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Commitee. The meeting took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where Mr Mitchell was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked" during the meeting. The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. The officers have since said they regret giving the statement, but Mr Mitchell's allies have dubbed this a "regretful non-apology" and called for root-and-branch changes to increase police accountability. Asked whether he believed the apology should be the end of the matter, former policing minister Nick Herbert said: "No, I don't think it is enough." The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The wording of the IPCC report, let's just remind ourselves, was incredibly strong. "They suggest that the police officers gave a false account, that there was a deliberate attempt to discredit Andrew Mitchell, that their motives seem plain: they were pursuing a political agenda. "Now when the independent body says this, it is surely right that action is taken and it is very unsatisfactory that we have a situation where the leadership of the police force appears to disagree and take no action in spite of the view of the independent body that was set up to deal with complaints." Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <body>A wallaby has set up camp in Highgate Cemetery in north London. The marsupial was first photographed at the cemetery - famed as the final resting place of Karl Marx - on Sunday. Melanie Wynward, who runs visitor services, said they had all seen the animal which was wandering around "as bold as brass". It is a mystery as to where the creature has come from. No animals have been reported missing from nearby Golders Hill Park zoo. Ms Wynward said there were no plans to move the wallaby, which they are going to let settle and see how it gets on. Staff are leaving out fruit and vegetables. "The animal is in a section of the cemetery which is only accessible on the guided tours," said Ms Wynward. "I've had a call from a lady who wanted to rescue and adopt it but I told her we'd take care of it." Staff at the cemetery believe they may have seen a second wallaby since the weekend. The cemetery already looks after foxes, rare insects, bats and also has a beehive. A wallaby was spotted last week on nearby Hampstead Heath, according to the Ham and High. Wallabies are native to Australia, however they have been introduced in the UK in parks, zoos and farms. Highgate Cemetery, which first opened in 1839, is the final resting place of TV personality Jeremy Beadle, punk impresario Malcolm McLaren and author George Eliot. </body>

      <title>Hall questioned over new allegations</title>
      <description>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall is rearrested by Lancashire Police over historical child sex offences.</description>

      <body>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall has been rearrested by Lancashire Police over child sex offences. The arrests relate to two females, who were aged between 12 and 15 at the time of the abuse, which was allegedly committed between 1974 and 1980. A force spokesman said the offences allegedly took place in Manchester and Derbyshire. Hall, 83, is serving a 30-month jail sentence for 14 counts of sexual abuse against girls. In June he admitted abusing the girls, who were aged from nine to 17, between 1967 and 1985. His original 15-month jail sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal in July. On Tuesday it was announced Hall had been stripped of the OBE he was awarded in December 2011. Hall, who had been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, is to serve half of his 30-month sentence, meaning he will be released in September 2014, the BBC understands. As a broadcaster, Hall was described as eccentric, erudite and egotistical - a distinctive personality who could balance light entertainment with sports and serious news. He was the face of BBC regional news in the North West before his national profile was raised presenting It's A Knockout on BBC TV, which he once described as "The Olympic Games with custard pies". In later years he was best known for his football match reports on BBC Radio Five Live. But Preston Crown Court heard he was an "opportunistic predator" who used his fame to befriend girls. </body>

      <description>The skipper of a racing yacht that collided with an oil tanker said it happened after the ship signalled to turn but never did.</description>

      <body>The skipper of a racing yacht that collided with an oil tanker in the Solent said it happened because the ship signalled to turn but never did. Roland Wilson, 32, of Perthshire, said his boat - the Atalanta of Chester - was on course to pass port-to-port with the 260m Hanne Knutsen. He is on trial accused of negligence by sailing too close to the tanker on the first day of Cowes Week in August 2011. Mr Wilson, an experienced sailor, claims he took "no unnecessary risks". He told Southampton Magistrates' Court: "This situation develops from being a safe situation to being an unsafe situation in a short time scale... because of the unexpected manoeuvre of the Hanne Knutsen after the starboard sound signal." Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time, is now a lieutenant in the reserves. He denies breaking maritime regulations by failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker. Under cross examination by prosecutor Charles Row, Mr Wilson was asked: "You had no clear idea how quickly she was going to turn?" He replied that he has seen hundreds of such ships turn at that point - prompting Mr Row to suggest that Wilson had assumed that was what the tanker would do and he had not observed properly. Mr Wilson denied the claim, telling the court he had seen the tanker from five miles away as his yacht raced. "Was it wishful thinking on your part, wishing to apportion blame on someone else than take responsibility yourself?" Mr Row asked. The skipper replied he did not want to apportion any blame. Mr Row: "You had all the time in the world to avoid this ship." Mr Wilson replied: "It remained a safe situation up until a couple of minutes before the collision." Rufus Taylor, defending the skipper, told the court: "The impact on the community was zero. "Is a prosecution a proportionate response to what happened, bearing in mind the excessive cost involved in the prosecution of this case? Simply no, it is not proportionate. "It was an accident, no one was hurt." The yacht, which had a crew of eight, had a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship in the collision with the 120,000-ton tanker. The trial is expected to end on Friday. </body>

      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-24637366</url>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <body>More than 6,000 tins of beans have been stolen from a parked-up lorry. Thieves cut a large hole in the curtain-sided lorry and took nearly two pallets of the tins of Heinz baked beans with sausages. The lorry had been parked in a lay-by on the A441, at Cookhill, near Redditch, Worcestershire, when the raiders struck. The driver had been asleep in the cab when the tins were taken during Monday night. "Police are appealing for information, especially about anyone trying to sell large quantities of Heinz baked beans in suspicious circumstances," a force spokesman said. </body>

The roads of Yorkshire will host the first stage of the 101st tour, which starts in Leeds and finishes in Harrogate on 5 July. It will be the first of two stages in Yorkshire before the riders race from Cambridge to London prior to the French stages. The race was last in the UK in 2007 when it started in London. The second, slightly longer stage will leave from York and finish in Sheffield. The county beat off rival bids from Florence and Edinburgh to host the two stages of the race next July. Meanwhile, new road signs to permanently mark the route of the Tour de France in North Yorkshire have been unveiled. Tourist organisation Welcome to Yorkshire said 50 signs would be installed along stage one of the route by North Yorkshire County Council. Welcome to Yorkshire said the signs would allow people to follow the stage one route for "years to come". The announcement of the signs along the stage one route in North Yorkshire came as the full itinerary of the three English stages of the race were released. The race is to start on the Headrow in Leeds and head out of the city north towards Harewood. It is also to visit Ilkley, Otley, Ripon, Skipton and Hawes before finishing after 118 miles (190km) in Harrogate.

      <body>A dog has died after eating a "glutinous" substance which has washed up on beaches in west Cornwall. Penzance vets said the three-year-old miniature schnauzer had eaten a white object on Long Rock beach on Tuesday. Two other dogs are seriously ill after eating the same substance on beaches in the area, vets have said. Dog owners have been warned to keep their animals away from west Cornwall's beaches. Coastguards are trying to identify the substance. David Fenwick, who reported the "glutinous" substance at Long Rock to coastguards, said it smelled of firelighters. "Some were the size of a cow pat, while others were much smaller, scattered all over the beach," he said. Paul Moseley's golden retriever became ill after coming into contact with the substance at Praa Sands, about four miles (6km) from Long Rock, on Tuesday. "Within 15 minutes she was sick," Mr Moseley said. "I presume she had eaten a small piece or licked it. "Some of the pieces were as small as marbles." Coastguards said another substance, described as "vegetable oil-like", was found washed up at Pedn Vounder beach, near the Minack Theatre, on Sunday. Small pockets of the same substance were found at Porthcurno and Porthchapel beaches. A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said: "Samples of the suspected vegetable oil found near Land's End have been sent to two accredited laboratories for analysis. "The MCA expects to have the results before the end of this week." </body>

      <title>Stilton ruling 'cheeses off' village</title>
      <description>Cambridgeshire villagers say they will continue their fight to have Stilton recognised as the home of the blue cheese, after the government rules against them.</description>

      <body>The Cambridgeshire village of Stilton has had its bid to make its namesake cheese rejected. Under EU law, Stilton can only be produced in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, where it is thought the cheese originated. The Bell Inn in Stilton already makes a blue-veined cheese but has to call it Bells Blue instead of Stilton. The Original Cheese Company had sought to have the EU ruling amended to include the village of Stilton. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman said: "As The Original Cheese Company is not producing stilton cheese, its application to change the product specification does not meet EU eligibility rules." Liam McGivern, landlord of the Bell Inn, said: "Defra are moving the goalposts. They have rejected the application just because The Original Cheese Company registered the application and not us. "It's ridiculous that we can't make Stilton in Stilton. People come in and ask for it several times a week and I have to tell them we can't legally call it Stilton. "We're going to press on with our fight." In 1996, the Stilton Cheese Makers' Association (SCMA) achieved Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status for blue Stilton from the European Commission. The PDO effectively gives Stilton cheese protection from imitation throughout the EU. Current EU law only allows Stilton to be produced by a few farms in the East Midlands, where it is believed the cheese originated. However, Stilton resident and local historian, Richard Landy, claimed documents from the 18th Century could prove the cheese originated in the Cambridgeshire village. </body>

      <body>A university in Dorset has enlisted the help of a dog to help students who need extra learning support. Jack, a shih tzu, has been brought in by Bournemouth University to help students with mental health issues and physical or sensory impairments. The three-year-old, owned by tutor Carolyn Atherton, has become part of the additional learning support team. Ms Atherton said he was "laid back until horizontal [but] if someone's upset, he's there like a shot". Jack's job was created as a pilot in conjunction with local voluntary group Caring Canines. He spends the day in the office with his owner and attends one-to-one tutorials with up to 12 students a week. Ms Atherton said he helps them relax, focus and cope better with tasks they find difficult. She said: "I always ask students first if they are happy for him to be there - so far, no-one has said no. "He always brings a smile to their face. "He's a little dog with a big presence - a bit of a character. He's laid back until he's horizontal, but he has his mad moments too. "We all find his aloofness funny. But if someone's upset, student or staff, he's there like a shot." </body>

      <title>Pumpkin boat sets new 'world record'</title>
      <description>An artist claims he has set a new world record by paddling a giant pumpkin across a Portsmouth dock.</description>

      <body>An artist who works with outsized vegetables claims he has set a new world record of exactly two minutes for the fastest 100m paddle in a pumpkin. Dmitri Galitzine sourced two 600lb (270kg) and 800lb (360kg) squashes at the Mere Brow Giant Pumpkin Show. Speaking after his 100m paddle in Portsmouth, he said it had been "difficult" but paddling the pumpkin through the dock had "felt good". Guinness World Records said it had received notification of the attempt. Mr Galitzine, who also plans to cross the Solent from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight in a giant gourd powered by an outboard motor, spent days working with boating experts to create two pumpkin vessels. The larger pumpkin was fitted with an outboard motor for the Solent crossing, while the smaller one was hollowed out for the world record paddle attempt. His record attempt was recorded by independent adjudicators, and will be examined later, Guinness World Records said. It had said Mr Galitzine would have to complete the 100m paddle within three minutes to set a new record. Mr Galitzine, who creates giant vegetable sculptures influenced by English folk culture, has no sailing experience but was supported by Portsmouth marine entrepreneur Jonny Boys. His next challenge will be the three-mile crossing of the Solent on Thursday from Stokes Bay in Gosport, using a hollowed out pumpkin powered by an outboard engine. A handful of pumpkin regattas, in which boaters race each other in giant pumpkin ships, have been held in the US and Nova Scotia in Canada since the 1990s. A pumpkin boat race also took place in Hampshire in 2006. Mr Galitzine said that while sailing pumpkins was "not common... the crossing over the Solent is different to the regattas in the US, [as] it's over three miles and there are strong tides". </body>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace after less than a year in charge. It is unclear whether the 50-year-old resigned, was sacked, or left by mutual consent but the Premier League club are holding a news conference at 17:30 BST. Holloway guided Palace to promotion via the play-offs last season after joining in November 2012, and has won only one league game and lost seven this season. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. Speculation surrounded Holloway's job following a meeting with chairman Steve Parish after the loss to Fulham, with the pair believed to have held further talks on Tuesday. The former Blackpool manager said he spent a long time with his players immediately after the defeat. Speaking before the game at Selhurst Park, Parish had told BBC Radio 5 live that Holloway's position was secure. More to follow. </body>

      <title>I have been treated unfairly - Hock</title>
      <description>Gareth Hock thinks his breach of discipline was not bad enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad.</description>

      <body>Gareth Hock has told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. Hock overslept the next morning, missing a recovery session, and was informed of his dismissal in a phone conversation with coach Steve McNamara. "For missing a 10-minute swim - I think it's out of order really," said Hock. "I agree that it was wrong and we shouldn't have had a drink, but there were six or seven of us and we all did the same thing," he told BBC North West Tonight. England have said they will make no further comment about Hock's removal. Huddersfield's Brett Ferres has been added to the squad in his place. In a statement released late on Tuesday evening, they confirmed the Salford-bound second-rower had been taken out of the 24-man party "as a result of serious breaches of team discipline that have fallen below the strict code of conduct as agreed by team management". Hock's career has been littered with controversy, including a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2009, and he admitted he can understand why people may jump to conclusions about the nature of his indiscretion. He continued: "People are thinking the worst because of the way it's been handled. I know what people will be thinking, and that's up to them. It's come out wrong and people are thinking the worst. "That's the only thing that's happened and I only did the same as what the other lads did, apart from sleeping in for half an hour." An alcohol ban had been imposed on the England squad until after their World Cup opener against pre-tournament favourites Australia in Cardiff on 26 October. But Hock said the ban was broken after they lost their final warm-up match 15-14 to the unfancied Italians in Salford. The former Wigan Warriors man, who has won eight England caps, added: "A few of the boys went out for a few drinks and then went out for a bite to eat. We came back and I overslept. I missed a 10-minute swim and a 10-minute medical check-up. "We were told that there was no drinking until after the Australia game, but we were disappointed about the loss and a few of us had a few drinks. "We got a phone call from Steve to say he'd found out we'd been out, and he would be ringing us back with his decision. He rang me back and said he was going to be taking me out of the squad." Hock, who was unhappy not to be told the news face-to-face, continued: "I blew up a bit and he said the others would be getting disciplined as well, but then afterwards I found out that there was only me being taken out of the squad. I was gutted. I thought it was a bit harsh and I just needed a warning like they did. "I've worked really hard for this and the people in the camp will tell you that. It's embarrassing. "All I can say is 'sorry' again for what I did do, but it's nothing bad compared to what people are thinking." Viewers in the BBC North West region can watch the full extended interview in North West Tonight on BBC One at 18:30 BST on Wednesday evening. </body>

      <title>Robshaw to captain England in autumn</title>
      <description>Chris Robshaw will captain England in their forthcoming autumn Test series after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood.</description>

      <body>Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will resume the England captaincy in their forthcoming autumn Tests after holding off the challenge of Tom Wood. Robshaw, 27, first led England against Scotland in February 2012 and continued in the role for 16 Tests. But having missed out on a British and Irish Lions place, he was rested for this summer's Argentina tour, when fellow back-rower Wood took over. But head coach Stuart Lancaster has decided to stick with Robshaw. The decision means he is likely to remain at open-side flanker for the matches against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand. "The first and foremost criteria for captaincy is to be on the team sheet and Chris is in there on his playing ability," Lancaster said. "But on top of that he has a massive amount of respect within the squad and has led England well. Every team needs leaders; we are building a strong group and Chris is at the forefront of that leadership." A year ago both Lancaster and Robshaw enjoyed their finest hour in the shock victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham. The uncertain form of his club side Harlequins has meant Robshaw has endured a difficult start to the season. But with his main rival for the number seven shirt, Gloucester's Matt Kvesic, also playing in a struggling side, he has won the battle for both his place and leadership role. "Every time you pull on that white shirt it's a privilege," Robshaw said. "It's a huge honour to be named captain and to lead your country. But I've always said it's not about who you are but what you do and I've got to make sure that I perform as a player first. "We have some good leaders across the squad and I know we will support each other as we head into a massive game against Australia." With Lancaster expected to give Saracens' Billy Vunipola a first start at number eight against Australia on 2 November, the likely inclusion of Wood and Robshaw in the other two back-row positions gives England significant experience for the southern hemisphere tests ahead. Lancaster is "pretty optimistic" that Wood's Northampton team-mate Dylan Hartley will be fit to face the Wallabies next week despite the hooker having his foot in a plastic boot after turning his ankle over playing for Saints in their Heineken Cup win over Ospreys on Sunday. Bath prop David Wilson has also also yet to train with the squad at their Leeds base this week and is receiving ongoing treatment for a tight calf. Gloucester's uncapped centre Henry Trinder, a contender to make his debut against Australia, is "progressing well" with a hamstring strain and could return to training on Thursday. But prop Alex Corbisiero remains a doubt for the Wallabies Test as he continues with "off-field" rehabilitation from a knee injury. </body>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>Sex Pistols 'took over my house'</title>
      <description>How a Sex Pistols collection became an obsession</description>

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid £100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had £2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <title>Antique guns 'adapted' by criminals</title>
      <description>Antique and obsolete guns are targeted by criminal gangs</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24626158</url>

      <body>Antiques and obsolete guns are being adapted and used by criminals facing a shortage of weapons, according to police. A decade ago, Britain's cities were experiencing a surge in gun crime but, following successful interventions by crime agencies and the government, the number of firearms offences annually is now half what it was in 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics. One reason is the supply of weapons has been severely restricted, forcing criminals to seek out other means of sourcing guns. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS), established in 2008, helps police forces solve crimes in which guns have been used, identify individuals who import and supply them illegally, and track down people who are illegally converting or adapting them. On the firing range at its base in a Birmingham suburb, ballistics expert Greg Taylor shoots several rounds from a Russian-made Baikal pistol. Built to fire CS gas canisters, they were easily adapted to fire live 9mm ammunition. There was a period, a few years ago, where this was the go-to gun of choice for criminal gangs in the UK, but as a result of international co-operation between British and Russian authorities and those in the Baltic states, the supply has dried up. But other weapons have taken its place. In the laboratory next door cupboards are filled with evidence from active firearms investigations by the 28 police forces in England and Wales which NABIS serves. On the desks are microscopes used by the ballistics experts to match bullets to weapons and in the armoury is a collection of hundreds of different weapons, kept in store in order to be used to provide matches to crime scenes. Many were brought here rather than destroyed after successful prosecutions in the courts. One is the Hungarian Feg pistol which was used during an incident where West Midlands Police officers were attacked during the riots in 2011. They came under fire from gang members outside the Barton Arms pub in Aston. As a result, 10 people were jailed, including Beniha Laing and Wesley Gray, who were sentenced to 35 and 29 years respectively. Another weapon seized after that attack was a French-made Saint-Etienne army revolver, used by the French Army in the 1870s. Like many weapons of that era, spanning from the American Civil War until WWI, they can be legally imported as antiques. Though they were built to fire ammunition that is now obsolete, they can be adapted to fire modern bullets. "You can buy a weapon like that because it's of obsolete calibre, there's no licence required, and criminals are converting or modifying ammunition to fit," said Mr Taylor. As we are discussing the problem, a new addition to the collection is brought in - a single shot Derringer-style pistol, which might have been carried by ladies in the late 19th Century for personal protection. It is thought that a number of burglaries at antiques weapons collectors' homes across the country may have been ordered by gangs who are desperate to source new guns and rifles. There are stringent penalties for possessing a firearm, including imprisonment. However, NABIS say there are now "armourers", who illegally provide guns for hire to gangs because of the shortage of supply. In some cases, the same gun might have been used a number of times by different gangs in different cities. "In the UK, getting your hands on a weapon is probably not as free and easy as it is in some countries," said Det Supt Iain O'Brien. "So you have a situation where weapons can be used by different sides of a dispute." The next potential threat in this country is the introduction of a gun which can be made using a 3D printer. It would not need to be imported. When the ballistics expert tested one on the range, using a remote firing device and behind the safety of a bulletproof screen, it blew up. It would probably have caused more damage to the person firing it than the one being fired at. However, as crude as early versions are, they could become more sophisticated. </body>

      <title>Sir Alex Ferguson book: The best bits</title>
      <description>Sir Alex Ferguson on Beckham, City and Ronaldo</description>

      <body>Sir Alex Ferguson's eagerly anticipated autobiography provides unprecedented insight into one of football's most successful and iconic managers. The 71-year-old retired last summer after 26 years as manager of Manchester United, having guided the club to 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League crowns. In 'Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography', released on Thursday, the Scot, who was succeeded by David Moyes, addresses a number of subjects. Ferguson's falling-out with David Beckham followed United's FA Cup fifth-round defeat to Arsenal in 2003. The United boss was critical of the midfielder's performance - but Beckham did not react well to being singled out. "As usual, with David at that time, he was dismissive of my criticism," wrote Ferguson. "He was around 12 feet from me. David swore. I moved towards him, and as I approached I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. He rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. 'Sit down,' I said. 'You've let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.' "I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. "The next day, the story was in the press. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go." Ferguson says Ronaldo was the "most gifted player" he managed, adding: "He surpassed all the other great ones I coached at United." The winger spent six years at Old Trafford before he moved to Real Madrid in 2009 for a world-record £80m transfer fee. He might have moved to Real a year earlier, but Ferguson had been unhappy with the Spanish club's public courting of the player, who had joined United from Sporting Lisbon in a £12m deal in 2003. The Scot was so irate with Real president Ramon Calderon that he told Ronaldo he would rather "shoot" him than "sell" him to Real at that stage, before promising the player he could leave Old Trafford the following summer if the right deal came along. Ferguson had several run-ins with Rafael Benitez while the Spaniard was manager of Liverpool. In his book, Ferguson explained that the chief reason for the fall-out was because Benitez chose to "turn our rivalry personal". Ferguson said: "Once you made it personal, you had no chance. Benitez was striving for trophies while also taking me on. That was unwise." Ferguson is a big admirer of Rooney's natural ability but had concerns about his fitness, particularly during his last season in charge. "I felt he was struggling to get by people and had lost some of his old thrust," wrote Ferguson, who signed Rooney from Everton in 2004. "As time wore on, I felt he struggled more and more to do it for 90 minutes." Finally, Ferguson added that Rooney came to see him after United had won the Premier League title last season and asked to leave the club. Ferguson explained: "I left him to discuss his future with David Moyes, hoping to see many more great performances from him at Old Trafford." Perhaps the biggest criticism in Ferguson's book is reserved for former United midfielder Roy Keane. Ferguson wrote the following: "The hardest part of Roy's body is his tongue. He has the most savage tongue you can imagine. "He can debilitate the most confident person in the world in seconds. He was an intimidating, ferocious individual." </body>

      <title>Norway note in bottle sparks appeal</title>
      <description>Norwegian family try to trace London girl who sent it in 1986</description>

      <body>A Norwegian family is trying to trace a British woman who placed a message in a bottle in 1996. The note written by the then 12-year-old Loretta Brooks from London was washed up off Rjaneset in April last year and found by a sister and brother. Mia and Martin Rodal, now aged 10 and eight, spotted it while on a walk with their parents but their own postal response did not elicit a reply. Despite turning to social media, they have been unable to locate Loretta. "Finding a letter in a bottle is a kids' dream. It is like finding a secret treasure," said Mia and Martin's father Gunnar. "The kids talked about treasure hunting by the sea, and finding a message that had drifted across the North Sea for 16 years was an exciting experience. "But we have tried all options we could think of to find Loretta." It is not known where the bottle containing the letter, dated 14 July 1996, started its journey but it could have potentially travelled more than 800 miles (1,300km) from the UK to Norway. Mia and Martin, from Oslo, spotted the plastic bottle during an Easter holiday visit to their grandparents, who live on Norway's west coast. "They were about four metres away but said they could see a message in a bottle," said Mr Rodal, a 42-year-old sales executive. "It was surrounded by slippery rocks so I took it out of the water for them." In the brief letter, Loretta described herself as a "girl from England". "I don't know who you are but anyway... What is your name? Send me a letter," she wrote. Mr Rodal said: "Mia was fascinated by the thought of a 12-year-old girl that she maybe could be friends with. It took a little bit of time to understand that she would not be 12 anymore." But Loretta did not give her full address on the letter, only including what appears to be an incomplete postcode. She wrote her address as either London E 436, or London E 43G, England, suggesting she lived in the east of the capital. Despite the lack of details, the family decided to send a response, together with a photocopy of Loretta's letter and the original bottle. "I added my own address and an explanation on the envelope but we didn't hear anything," said Mr Rodal. He said: "Of course there is every chance that Loretta had moved and maybe changed her name. But we have tried to find her using Facebook, Linkedin and other online options." More than a year later, Mr Rodal said he was inspired again to try to trace Loretta after reading a newspaper story this month about a letter dropped into the sea in Cornwall in September 1994. That letter was found by a remote beach near the town of Hauge in Norway and traced to its sender Lucy Elliot, who is now 31, and living in Northamptonshire. There have been suggestions that several mistakes in Loretta's letter - use of the word "on" instead of "in", for example - indicate it may have actually been written by a Norwegian child. Mr Rodal said he "could not rule out the option", but the family was inspired to focus their efforts further afield because "the look and the wear of the bottle, and how fragile the paper was, did not give us any reason to believe it hadn't spent 16 years at sea".

      <description>French travellers begin to leave a hospital car park where they took over spaces reserved for medical staff.</description>

      <body>French travellers are leaving a hospital car park they have occupied since Saturday, blocking spaces reserved for medical staff. The travellers were warned to move from the Royal Gwent in Newport by Tuesday or face legal action. However, some of the 13 caravans remained - and it was only at about 16:00 BST on Wednesday that a procession of vehicles began leaving. One traveller told BBC Wales they had been waiting for a car to be fixed. The travellers, who said they were attending a funeral, arrived at the 300-space car park on Saturday, taking up 65 spaces. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away from the car park on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After the 16:00 BST deadline passed on Tuesday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, confirmed it would take legal action. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm [on Tuesday]," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. One of the travellers, Ringo Gogan, told the BBC they planned to leave for France at 17:00 BST once one of their cars had been repaired. He said they had come to Wales for a funeral and told police they were staying for a couple of days. </body>

      <body>An 81-year-old church minister has been arrested in south west Wales over an allegation of historical child abuse. Gwyn Ieuan Morgan from Johnstown, Carmarthen, has been suspended from duties at his two chapels pending the outcome of a police investigation. Dr Geraint Tudur, general secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, said members were "naturally traumatised". Dyfed Powys Police said the minister had been bailed while inquiries continue. Mr Morgan has served Bryn Iwan Chapel, near Cynwyl Elfed, and Moreia Chapel in Blaenwaun, north of St Clears, since 1972. Dr Tudur said: "As a charity which offers our members legal and pastoral support, we advised the churches involved to suspend their minister at once, pending the outcome of the investigation. "This advice was immediately acted upon by church trustees. "The church members are naturally traumatised by this development and the union is giving them continuing pastoral support." A statement from the group added: "The union has no power to enforce CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks and registration, although it regularly and strongly urges local churches to ensure that the procedure is followed." Dyfed Powys Police confirmed that "an 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with an historic allegation of sexual activity with a minor". "He remains on bail while inquiries continue," the force added. </body>

      <description>Waiting times for cancer treatment improve but health boards are still failing to meet the target for treating the most urgent cases.</description>

      <body>Waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales have improved according to the latest figures. However, all Welsh health boards are still failing to meet the Welsh government's target for treating the most urgent cases. Figures for August show that 88.6% of urgent cancer patients had started definitive treatment within 62 days of diagnosis - up from 84.5% in July. The target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in that time scale. Conservative Shadow Health Minister, Darren Millar AM, said: "Any improvement is a step in the right direction but it is clear that more progress is urgently required. "This is a critically-important target that hasn't been met in five years." Figures for August released by the Welsh government on Wednesday also show 98.5% of patients started treatment within 31 days through the non-urgent route, compared to 98.2% the previous month. There was a small improvement in waiting times for other cancer cases. But none of the six health boards that provide cancer care met the Welsh government's target of providing definitive treatment for the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days. This target has not been met on an all-Wales basis for several years. Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying experience. "It is appalling that people are being forced to wait over two months until the start of their treatment." Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones said despite some signs of improvement, waiting times for people with cancer remained "unacceptable". "A Plaid Cymru government would provide all cancer patients with a specialist cancer nurse to guide them through treatment and rehabilitation," she said. The Welsh government has been asked to comment. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>The broadcasting watchdog finds BBC and ITV programmes in breach of its rules after a Tory peer was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations surrounding a north Wales home.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Esytn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <body>The Wales National Pool will no longer be the base for elite Paralympic swimmers, the sport's governing body has announced. British Swimming will relocate athletes to Manchester in a move to centralise training after what was seen as a poor performance at London 2012. The Swansea pool board has asked the Welsh and UK governments, along with UK Sport, to get the decision reversed. Its chair Anne Ellis has called it a "significant blow". The Swansea pool has produced medal winning swimmers such as Ellie Simmonds and Dave Roberts. The Manchester pool will be known as the National Performance Centre and the body's new head coach, Rob Greenwood, took up his role on Monday. British Swimming said the move north will give athletes greater levels of support. National performance director Chris Furber said: "A review took place to ensure that we were providing athletes with the best support and services within their daily training environments. "The decision was made, as we move forwards towards Rio [2016 Games], we would have one national performance centre where we will have the very best support and services that athletes require. "We will continue to work with Swim Wales regarding the support that athletes receive in Wales and how we can also support their talent programmes." The South Wales Evening Post newspaper quoted a letter from the Wales National Pool's chairwoman Anne Ellis to politicians. It read: "The decision to stop using the excellent pool facilities in Swansea as a base for elite Paralympics swimming is a significant blow to disability sport provision in Wales." She added this was "particularly disappointing not only because of the exceptional track record developed by Swansea, but also it now means that all elite Paralympic swimmers from Wales will have to travel to Manchester if they want to be in the GB National Squad. "This also means the pool loses out on income from elite training and the coaching excellence developed in the field of Paralympics swimming is under threat." British Swimming's budget was cut after the London Olympics. A spokesperson for Sport Wales said: "Our central focus continues to be that talented Welsh swimmers are able to reach their potential and have access to high level coaching and support. We will be discussing how Swim Wales and British Swimming can achieve this with the help of our investment and resources." The Disability Swimming In Swansea group said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision. "Of course we understand that difficult decisions have to be made on how to use limited funding, but the results achieved from Swansea consistently over a number of years speak for themselves, including performances at London 2012 and the recent IPC World Championships. "There is still a key role for Swansea and Swim Wales to play in the disability swimming performance pathway. Discussions are ongoing on how the centre at Swansea fits into these plans leading to the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games." </body>

      <body>A jury in the trial of a former Denbigh mayor accused of causing explosions in the town has been sent home after retiring to consider its verdict. John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he made fireworks and denied getting a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. At the start of his trial, the jury was told that in February this year a series of small explosions occurred in Denbigh which damaged a number of cars. It led to a "main explosion" on 24 March when a device, akin to a bomb, was placed under a Land Rover Discovery in the town. The explosion damaged the vehicle, along with one parked beside it, while ball-bearings and shrapnel from the device were thrown "far and in all directions", the court heard. "Windows were smashed. These events brought fear to the local community," said prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones. The prosecution said it believed Mr Larsen was behind the explosions as they stopped after he was arrested on 19 April. The former mayor denies three arson charges, one of causing an explosion and two of possessing explosives - one with intent to endanger life. Mr Larsen said he made "fireworks, not bombs". </body>

      <description>Welsh rugby's four regions back the Anglo-French plan for a revamped European competition from next season.</description>

      <body>Wales' four rugby regions are backing Anglo-French plans for a new European competition in a further threat to the future of the Heineken Cup. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons claim the revamped tournament offers "significant advantages". The Welsh Rugby Union opposes the new European competition. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis has said it would be a "crazy concept" to get rid of the Heineken Cup. In a statement, Regional Rugby Wales, which represents the four Welsh regions, confirmed its full support for the proposed new Rugby Champions Cup competitions. "Whilst there remain elements of detail to be confirmed, it is now clear that there are a number of significant advantages to the new competitions in equality of governance, format, qualification and distribution across the individual participating clubs," it read. "Consequently, RRW looks forward to working with the WRU to support their efforts and positive engagement in striving to ensure our teams are involved in strong, valuable European clubs competitions in time for next season." The Welsh, Scottish and Irish Rugby Unions are refusing to let their clubs participate in any European competition if it does not have the "full approval" of the International Rugby Board (IRB). The IRB has previously indicated to the BBC it could support a new-look competition if it was approved by the English and French unions. Europe's top teams currently compete in the Heineken Cup or second-tier Amlin Challenge Cup. England's Aviva Premiership clubs and their French Top 14 counterparts announced in June 2012 their intention to leave the competition organised by European Rugby Cup Ltd (ERC). ERC is staging a meeting for stakeholders in Dublin on Wednesday, but representatives of the English and French clubs are expected to boycott the gathering. English and French clubs believe ERC has not made the most of commercial opportunities and that qualification for Europe is skewed in favour of Celtic and Italian teams. They also believe that tournament funds have not been fairly distributed. Their contention that Pro12 teams have an unfair advantage when it comes to qualifying for European places has caused simmering resentment for several seasons. At least three Wales teams automatically enter Europe's top tier no matter where they finish in the Pro12, while at least three of Ireland's four teams are also guaranteed entry. Scotland and Italy both get two spots. </body>

      <body>A Chinese company's plans for a £50m luxury tourist village in Carmarthenshire have been shelved. Maxhard Ltd wanted to build a 100-bed hotel and 80 holiday homes with a swimming pool on a 22-acre (9 hectares) site near Llandeilo aimed at "a select international clientele". It expected to attract 20,000 visitors a year, but was criticised for its "inappropriate" design. A smaller scheme is being considered but no decision has been made. The developers said they intended to submit revised plans in June of this year, but the scheme's architect Julian Castle told BBC Wales they are no further forward and no revised plans had been submitted. He added the project could "possibly" go ahead or it "possibly won't". "There hasn't been much encouragement from the Welsh government, although there has been a lot of local interest," he told BBC Wales. "At present the plan is on hold and due to the financial climate it's difficult to say whether or not it will be completed." The Llandeilo plan, which included 10 shops and a car park, aimed to create up to 70 full-time jobs. Maxhard, which has offices in London and China, said it would have been a "luxurious development for a select international clientele looking to enjoy a tranquil Welsh retreat". It would have been on the doorstep of Pantglas Hall, where a separate resort offers timeshare log cabins, a restaurant and leisure facilities. Managers of the neighbouring Pantglas Owners' Club had concerns about the scale of the tourist village. Eifion Bowen, head of planning at Carmarthenshire council, said there had been discussions to amend the design. "While the application has been withdrawn, the authority is available at any time to discuss a revised application," he said. A Welsh government spokesperson added: "We had been in discussions with the developer and were awaiting full details of their scheme, which would be subject to usual planning consents." </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <body>Around 5,500 rare Arctic charr fish have been released into a Snowdonia lake to help restore their numbers. The Arctic charr population at Llyn Padarn, Llanberis, has been dropping over a number of years with some blaming poor water quality. It is the fourth year that juvenile charr have been released into the lake. In previous years the fish have also been restocked at Llyn Crafnant, near Trefriw, Conwy, developed as a back-up source of charr for Llyn Padarn. However, new stock will not be introduced into Crafnant this year as Natural Resources Wales (NRW) officers are monitoring populations in the lake to see if previous restocking efforts have been successful. "We're committed to ensuring the future of the iconic Arctic charr population in Llyn Padarn and we've put great effort into restocking thousands of fish over the years," said NRW spokesman Tim Jones. "At the same time, we're continuing to work with Dwr Cymru Welsh Water and others to find ways to improve water quality in the lake and create a better habitat for the charr to survive." A breeding programme has been set up at NRW's Mawddach hatchery in a bid to protect the rare fish, which can only be found in a few cold, deep lakes in north Wales. In July a report confirmed that nutrients from sewage effluent had damaged the water quality at Llyn Padarn following an incident in 2009. NRW said the nutrients also caused a toxic algal bloom which closed the lake for weeks at a time. Stricter limits have since been imposed on a local sewage works. </body>

      <body>Singer Cerys Matthews hosts a concert celebrating Wales' musical heritage to officially open the Womex world music showcase and trade fair in Cardiff. Some 2,500 delegates are due to attend the event, which runs until Sunday. Treorchy Male Choir, Ballet Cymru and children from Cardiff Bay are among those performing at the Wales Millennium Centre concert. Matthews, artistic director of the opening concert, said she hoped it would offer "a bit of madness". "The one thing that I love about music is that it's spontaneous," she told BBC Wales. "It's from the heart and it's by people for people - no marketing men, no politics, great sounds and a lot of passion from all the performers and hopefully a lot of enthusiasm from the audience as well." Womex will include performances from around 50 leading musical acts from around the world at the Wales Millennium Centre, along with business meetings, seminars, and a trade fair at the Motorpoint Arena in the city. However a group of Syrian performers - Ensemble Al-Kindi - have had to pull out of a concert on Thursday after being refused entry to the UK. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will officially open the event on Wednesday evening, said: "We're delighted that the best from world music has come to Wales this week. "However, Womex also offers a window to the world to hear the very best of Welsh music." The opening concert will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Wales, with TV highlights shown on Sunday on BBC Two Wales. Cerdd Cymru Music Wales, which won the bid for Womex to come to Wales, estimated the economic impact of the conference to be around £3m. The event has been held at various locations across Europe since 1994, and was last held in Thessaloniki in Greece in 2012. </body>

      <body>People moving into Wales should be more tolerant of the wishes of local people who support wind turbines, an AM says. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the chair of the assembly's environment committee, was commenting on bitter rows about wind energy plans on the Llyn peninsula. As part of a BBC Wales Taro 9 investigation he says some incomers should "learn to work with" locals. But opponents of turbines say they would be as destructive as the flooding of valleys to create reservoirs. The programme being shown on S4C examines wind turbine developments and proposals on the Llyn Peninsula. Lord Elis-Thomas, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, believes more green energy should be produced, and people moving to Wales should not object so strongly. He told the programme: "I've noticed that there are a number of people who have moved into Wales who vocally oppose stopping Wales developing natural resources and I think this is something very serious. "Because if people move to an area to live, they must learn to work with the people in that area and the economy of this area is vitally important to us all." While some claim wind turbines benefit local communities, the programme also hears from opponents like Sian Parri of the Friends of Llyn Society. She likens wind turbines to the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in the 1960s to provide water to Liverpool. "They say that this is our Tryweryn, and there is no sadder sight in my mind in the history of Wales than that small group of people running down that hill after Celyn Valley had been drowned," she said. "And it will be very sad to come to the Llyn in a few years time with the place destroyed and the views ruined." Others say the divisive issue has far-reaching consequences for a usually tight-knit community. "It's already split long-standing friendships and family ties," said Steve Dorling from Llanaelhaearn. "I can't imagine this proposal is any different to others on the peninsula. "It's very sad when kids that went to school together and are now in their forties and fifties no longer speak and that's the case." Taro 9 can be seen on S4C on Tuesday 22 October 2013 at 21:30 BST </body>

      <body>People planning to go walking in Snowdonia as the half-term holidays approach have been warned to be prepared for the dark. MountainSafe, which represents rescuers and other agencies, said people were getting caught out as nights drew in. A group of 30 walkers recently needed help from mountain rescue teams when one of them got injured after dark. One warden said many did not consider the length of their journey before starting and did not carry torches. Dewi Davies, Snowdonia National Park senior warden, said: "Lack of preparation is the reason behind the majority of calls to rescue teams at this time of year. "Walkers don't consider the length of their journey before starting and they don't consider that it gets much darker earlier these days. "They don't have a torch or a torch that's working and relying on a mobile phone isn't a good idea either." In the recent incident, the group of walkers did not begin their ascent of Snowdon from Llanberis until 14:00 BST. Mountain rescuers were called out at 21:30 BST when one of the group injured an ankle while coming down a rocky path in darkness. When rescuers arrived, they discovered not all the group had torches with them. MountainSafe has issued a five-point checklist for walkers: British Summer Time ends on Sunday, when turning the clocks back an hour will make it appear dark earlier. MountainSafe includes representatives from Snowdonia National Park Authority, North Wales Police, North Wales Mountain Rescue Association, the RAF, Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team and other agencies. </body>

Two men in their 30s were taken to hospital in Bangor but their injuries are not thought to be serious. The incident happened on Friday 18 October at a property in St Catherine's Close, Llanfaes near Beaumaris on Anglesey. Det Con Chris Burrow said he remained hopeful the masked pair would be identified. "During the course of the incident the offenders stole an amount of cash," he said. "We are hoping to obtain a full description of the offenders in due course but we believe they were wearing some sort of face masks. "Over the last 12 months we have seen a steady decrease in crimes of violence and with the continued support and vigilance from the local community I'm sure we can quickly identify those responsible."

      <body>The future of a Denbighshire town's community building remains undecided with campaigners vowing to fight plans that would see it demolished. Corwen Pavilion closed in March 2010 because of health and safety issues. Repairs were estimated at £1.3m and Denbighshire council planned to demolish it and pass the land to a community group to build a new venue. But the demolition was delayed by a court injunction and the council will now discuss the issue next month. Campaigners from Save the Pavilion say the building has played an important part in Welsh culture throughout the 20th Century. It has hosted several concerts and Welsh cultural festivals. The issue has now been placed back on the council agenda after being held up by legal discussions and other issues. Builder Esmor Davies, a member of the Save the Pavilion group, said: "Nine or 10 months has gone and nothing has been done about it. "It's appalling," he said, adding that the delay would only worsen the condition of the building. Demolition was due in April 2011 but it was delayed by a court injunction to give the campaign group time to come up with a viable financial plan for the building. A court hearing was then due to be held in December 2011 but delayed due to a lack of consent from the Charity Commission. The commission has confirmed it has consulted with Denbighshire council regarding demolition. The council in its role of trustee is now due to discuss the issue again at a cabinet meeting at the end of November. It will then be up to the courts early next year to make a decision. A spokesperson for Denbighshire council said if the court was to side with county officials then demolition could take place as soon as possible. Councillor Huw Jones said the issue should have been sorted some time ago. "It's a dangerous building," he said. "It needs to be resolved as soon as possible." He said Denbighshire council was committed to help provide a new building and that the authority "would not walk away". </body>

      <body>Two masked men who terrified a family in their own home during an early morning burglary have been jailed. Mold Crown Court heard they punched one woman in the face, threatened her and two others at knifepoint, and tried to stab a man with a screwdriver. Heroin addicts Colin Maher 31, and Michael Rhodes, 33, from Rhyl, admitted aggravated burglary at the house in Kinmel Bay. Jailing them for eight years, a judge said it was "the stuff of nightmares". "It understandably had a profound effect on the victims," Judge Rhys Rowlands added. "This was truly a terrifying ordeal at the hands of the two of you." Prosecutor David Mainstone told the court how 20-year-old Chantelle Palmer was staying the night with her parents and a 17-year-old girl was also present. In the early hours of 14 May, Miss Palmer was woken by a bang to find two men in the room - one had a hood covering most of his face and the other had a scarf covering his lower face. Both were wearing gloves, and one stood over her bed three feet away. The intruder looked at her and told her to give him money but she said she did not have any. He then held an eight-inch knife to her throat and again demanded money. Mr Mainstone said the burglar punched her, but she bravely hit him back and there was a struggle. While that was going on, a young woman aged 17 in the same bedroom was woken up to find a knife being held to her throat by the other man. "The knife was thrust at her five times before he punched out at her but she pulled her head away and they didn't connect," Mr Mainstone explained. She heard the first knifeman say that "his boys are outside". Miss Palmer's parents heard a commotion and entered the room. Her mother Ananka Palmer saw a man holding a knife at her daughter and then she "felt an arm and something cold across her neck". "She realised a knife was being held across her throat," said Mr Mainstone. "She pushed the man away with both hands, hard, she saw his face was covered and was terrified. She ran out of the room and was shaking." Her husband Carl Palmer grabbed hold of one of the knifemen and they struggled with each other. The intruder then lunged at Mr Palmer with a screwdriver in a stabbing motion but the householder was able to grab the attacker's throat to prevent him being stabbed, the court heard. It was at that stage that Miss Palmer took the screwdriver away from the attacker and her father was able to pull him out of the house. The burglars then fled in a stolen car. The defendants had been drinking before the burglary, their barristers said. Maher received an additional 18 months in jail for possessing heroin with intent to supply. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have attended the opening of a £4.3m pedestrian and cycle bridge across Rhyl harbour. Pont y Ddraig (Dragon's Bridge) provides the final link in 15 miles (24km) of traffic-free cycling across Conwy and Denbighshire. It was named by Rhyl pupil Leon Jones following a schools competition and local children were invited to the opening. Work was delayed earlier this year after cables were stolen from the site. About 200m (656ft) of cable was taken in April from the bridge, which boasts a 45m-high (about 148ft) mast. There are two sections of deck which lift up, with the underside lit up with lights that change from green to red and back. It provides a car-free alternative route to the nearby Blue Bridge, which Sustrans Wales said was very congested and deterred cyclists and walkers from using it. Pont-y-Ddraig now also forms part of a long-distance cycle route across the north Wales coast. Jane Lorimer, director of Sustrans Wales, which partly financed the bridge, said it was one of 10 schemes in Wales which was bringing investment to the local area. "Here in Rhyl the bridge is very much part of a regeneration scheme which is opening up an extension along Rhyl seafront and really putting this area, which is an area of deprivation, into the limelight as a place which is a joy to visit in its own right. "It's unlocked the whole of the harbour areas. There has been additional investment and there will be a visitor centre and public squares. "It's really about creating a destination where people can come and enjoy their time, spend money and get out and about." </body>

      <body>A registered sex offender faces jail after admitting making and possessing indecent images of children. Stephen Meredith, 60, of Four Crosses, Powys, admitted four charges at Welshpool Magistrates' Court. The court heard Meredith underwent a routine check by officers at his home, when he warned them about the contents of his computer. Magistrates told Meredith he faced jail and bailed him conditionally until 14 November for sentencing. Meredith appeared before magistrates on Tuesday and admitted three charges in relation to making indecent images of children. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children. Helen Tench, prosecuting, said that as a registered sex offender, police officers were making a routine check at Meredith's home on 2 May. When they entered the home, he told them he had "something on my computer that's not good", the court heard. Ms Tench said: "Officers sent the computer off for examination and under interview the defendant said he was 'weak-willed' and had nothing else in his life." She said that he had also made obscene internet searches. Ceri Edwards, defending, said Meredith had admitted the charges at the earliest opportunity. </body>

      <body>Urgent work has been carried out to unblock a river in a small village on Gower to prevent it being cut off by rising water. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) removed sand from a channel in Oxwich to restore the flow of water. It comes as 13 flood alerts were issued for rivers across south, west and mid Wales following heavy rain. But NRW has reduced these alerts to six and said the weather is expected to improve over the next 24 hours. A team of engineers has been in Oxwich with a digger to remove the sand, which blew in from the beach and is blocking the flow of water from a channel running through wetlands into the sea. NRW said the stream was backing up and threatening to cut off the village. Nick Edwards, senior reserves manager at NRW, said: "The water that flows down from the marsh has been blocked by the large amount of sand that's been deposited by the high tides recently. "If we didn't do this then in 72 hours, I imagine, the road will be flooded." There were reports of surface water flooding in Dunvant, Swansea, and in Pembroke overnight. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning of further heavy rain for south and west Wales on Tuesday. The B4296 at Dunvant Square near Brynaeron in Swansea was affected by surface water, although Mid and West Wales Fire Service said they had not received any calls from the area. Further west, staff at the Field Studies Centre in Orielton, south of Pembroke, reported seeing flooding near their base, including damage to some cars. A BBC weather presenter said more rainfall through the morning could lead to some localised flooding across south Wales, although the rain was expected to turn to showers in the afternoon. She added there was unlikely to be widespread flooding but surface water flooding could be a problem. Looking ahead, there were concerns that further heavy rainfall on Thursday could raise the risk again, with an early warning in place for south and west Wales. </body>

      <body>Close family, friends and colleagues of the former Football Association of Wales (FAW) president Tegwyn Evans have attended his funeral. Mr Evans, 85, of Welshpool, Powys, died on 8 October, a week after suffering a heart attack. Officials from the FAW attended the funeral service which was held in Welshpool on Monday. A minute's silence was observed for Mr Evans ahead of Wales' World Cup game against Macedonia on 11 October. Mr Evans was described as "passionate" about football, serving as an FAW council member since 1975 and as president from 2003 to 2006. He was also a former mayor of Welshpool, a president of the local football club and a successful businessman. The FAW has said Mr Evans, who was chairman of the Central Wales FA, was a "lifelong stalwart of mid Wales football". Following his death, it said: "During his time at the FAW he was a fine ambassador for the game at home and abroad and made many friends. "Everyone at the FAW salutes his service to football in Wales and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time." Away from football, Mr Evans was heavily involved in his local community and was widely known as "Mr Welshpool". He served on Welshpool Town Council for many years, including a spell as mayor between 1981 and 1983. In 2002, he was awarded the MBE for his services to the town and to Welshpool Football Club. </body>

      <body>Swansea City will once again be without defender Ashley Williams for Thursday's Europa League game against Kuban Krasnodar. Williams has missed Swansea's last five games and has been unable to train because of an ankle injury. The Wales captain is also doubtful for Sunday's home Premier League game against West Ham. "He's still in some pain when he does certain movements," manager Michael Laudrup said. "I already said a couple of weeks ago [that] we are not going to rush it." In Williams's absence Jordi Amat set to continue alongside fellow Spaniard Chico Flores at the heart of the Swans' defence. Laudrup has been impressed with 21-year-old Amat's performances whilst deputising for Williams. "Jordi has confirmed what I already knew and what I expected from him," Laudrup added. "I'm pleased with what I've seen." Left-back Ben Davies will miss the Group A game against the Russian side after being ruled out for up to four weeks with an ankle injury. Winger Pablo Hernandez could return after recovering from a hamstring injury while Jonjo Shelvey and Jose Canas could be recalled in central midfield. </body>

      <body>The search for a second permanent Gypsies and travellers' site in Swansea looks set to be widened across the city after councillors threw out the recommended options. Following a consultation, a report said the new site should be on council-owned land either in Cockett or Llansamlet. But after councillors debated the sites and three other locations that were considered, they voted to start again. Using private land and expanding the existing Llansamlet site are options. "I personally feel we should have been looking at an all-wider Swansea basis for the land," said Labour councillor Robert Francis-Davies, who proposed a new recommendation to ask cabinet to widen the search. "We should adopt a whole Swansea approach and consider all land options." Councillors voted unanimously to back the amendment and it is now up to cabinet to make the final decision. Five possible sites had been under consideration, including two in Gorseinon with the others in Penderry ward, Cockett and Llansamlet. During the meeting, representatives from all five sites and members of the traveller community gave their views on the proposals. The travellers said they wanted a second site in Llansamlet and were open to expanding the current site, but the council was warned that it was unlikely as it is on a flood plain. David Phillips, leader of Labour-led Swansea council, warned in advance of the meeting that issue was going to be "divisive". Swansea council said the Welsh government had insisted all local authorities in Wales look at the needs of Gypsies and travellers "as part of its assessment of accommodation needs". Residents had until 31 March to give their views and a number of campaigns have been launched in opposition to proposals for particular areas. A council spokesperson said: "The latest proposal is that we look at more sites within Swansea to see if there is somewhere suitable for a Gypsy and traveller site. "Our latest housing accommodation needs assessment shows there is a need to develop a second site in the city. "A number of families are residing in Swansea on unlawful and illegal sites and one of the ways to tackle this issue is to ensure they have a legal site for their homes." </body>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to a rugby player who has died suddenly aged 33. Father-of-two Stuart Williams, who played for Pontypridd RFC, was taken ill at work, Craig yr Hesg Quarry, on Monday and later died, the club said. Pontypridd's game against Neath - due to be played at the Gnoll this Saturday - has been postponed until further notice. Mr Williams, from Glyncoch, was married to Vicky and the couple had two young children, Harvey and Megan. Pontypridd RFC finance director Peter Howells described the prop forward as a "fine man on and off the pitch" who appeared well days before he died. The club said Mr Williams had a "real physical presence" in the front row. "I was with him on Saturday night, he wasn't unwell. Devastated is not the word," Mr Howells said. A statement on the club's website described Mr Williams as popular and loyal. "The club is today devastated by the news of Stuart's passing, and all thoughts now turn in deepest sympathy to his young family in their time of grief," it read. 'Devastating news' "Stuart was a popular character around the club, one who gave his all as a hard-grafting prop forward on the pitch, a long serving and loyal member of the squad. Mr Williams represented his local club at youth level before moving to Pontypridd. He graduated through the ranks and joined Rhymney in 2000. Following a spell with Cilfynydd, Mr Williams became a regular member of the Pontypridd senior squad. News of the death came as Wales coach Warren Gatland named his squad for the autumn internationals. "Our thoughts and condolences are with Stuart Williams' family," said Gatland. "On behalf of the Welsh Rugby Union and the national squad our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very, very sad time." </body>

      <body>The Ministry of Justice has been fined £140,000 after the details of more than 1,000 inmates at Cardiff prison were emailed to three prisoners' families. They included sensitive information including prisoners' names, ethnicity, addresses and release dates. The breaches were only discovered when the third recipient alerted the prison to the fact they had received a file. The ministry said the prison had now altered its procedures since the incidents in August 2011. The fine was imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After the data breach was reported an internal investigation was launched and the same error was found to have occurred on two previous occasions within the previous month, with details sent to different inmates' families. The ICO said neither incident was reported at the time. The emails about upcoming visits came from the prison clerk but also included a spreadsheet containing sensitive information including the names, ethnicity, addresses, sentence length, release dates and coded details of the offences carried out by all of the prison's 1,182 inmates. The ICO said police and a member of the prison staff were sent to visit the homes of those who had received the emails to check that the files had been deleted. The unauthorised disclosures were reported to the ICO on 8 September 2011. The ICO's investigation found that there was a clear lack of management oversight at the prison, with the clerk working unsupervised despite only having been at the prison for two months and having limited experience and training. A lack of audit trails also meant that the disclosures would have gone unnoticed if they had not been reported by one of the recipients, said the ICO. ICO deputy commissioner and director of data protection David Smith said: "The potential damage and distress that could have been caused by this serious data breach is obvious. "Disclosing this information not only had the potential to put the prisoners at risk, but also risked the welfare of their families through the release of their home addresses. "Fortunately it appears that the fall-out from this breach was contained, but we cannot ignore the fact that this breach was caused by a clear lack of management oversight of a relatively new member of staff." Furthermore, said Mr Smith, the prison service failed to have procedures in place to spot the original mistakes. "It is only due to the honesty of a member of the public that the disclosures were uncovered as early as they were and that it was still possible to contain the breach," he added. The investigation also found problems with the manner in which prisoners' records were handled, with unencrypted floppy disks regularly used to transfer large volumes of data between the prison's two separate networks. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "We treat the security of information very seriously and took immediate steps to recover the data as soon as the loss was reported to ensure that it went no further. "These types of incidents are extremely rare but this does not mean that we are complacent. "A thorough investigation was held by the prison who immediately altered their procedures, and further changes were implemented across the prison estate." </body>

      <body>Cardiff Blues captain Matthew Rees is to undergo testicular surgery. The region say the 32-year-old former Wales skipper, capped 58 times by his country, will have "an enforced spell away from rugby" as a result. The ex-British and Irish Lions hooker, who joined Blues from Scarlets in the summer, will initially miss Friday's RaboDirect Pro12 trip to Ulster. "Cardiff Blues would like to take this opportunity to wish Matthew a speedy recovery," a statement said. "And we look forward to seeing him back in action in the future. "The region will be making no further comment and would ask that the media respect Matthew's privacy at this time." Tonyrefail-born Rees was a late withdrawal from the Blues team ahead of their 19-15 Heineken Cup win over Toulon on Saturday. He played 182 times for the Scarlets after joining the region in the 2004-05 season and was famously part of the all-Welsh front row, along with props Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones, for the three Lions Tests against South Africa in June 2009. Rees previously played for Treorchy, Pontypridd and the now defunct Celtic Warriors and became Wales' 128th captain when given the role against Australia in November 2010. But he struggled to hold down a first-team place at Parc y Scarlets after missing out on Wales' World Cup campaign in 2011 through injury and departed for Cardiff at the end of last season. </body>

      <body>Waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales have improved according to the latest figures. However, all Welsh health boards are still failing to meet the Welsh government's target for treating the most urgent cases. Figures for August show that 88.6% of urgent cancer patients had started definitive treatment within 62 days of diagnosis - up from 84.5% in July. The target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in that time scale. Conservative Shadow Health Minister, Darren Millar AM, said: "Any improvement is a step in the right direction but it is clear that more progress is urgently required. "This is a critically-important target that hasn't been met in five years." Figures for August released by the Welsh government on Wednesday also show 98.5% of patients started treatment within 31 days through the non-urgent route, compared to 98.2% the previous month. There was a small improvement in waiting times for other cancer cases. But none of the six health boards that provide cancer care met the Welsh government's target of providing definitive treatment for the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days. This target has not been met on an all-Wales basis for several years. Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying experience. "It is appalling that people are being forced to wait over two months until the start of their treatment." Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones said despite some signs of improvement, waiting times for people with cancer remained "unacceptable". "A Plaid Cymru government would provide all cancer patients with a specialist cancer nurse to guide them through treatment and rehabilitation," she said. The Welsh government has been asked to comment. </body>

      <body>A plan to impose a levy on UK visitors' visas to pay for health services has not been properly thought through, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said. The UK government hopes to recover around a quarter of the £2bn spent on healthcare for overseas visitors and deter so-called "health tourism". Mr Jones told AMs there was no plans to redistribute any of the funds raised to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. He said UK ministers must "think again" as health was a devolved service. The UK government believes savings would come from the levy on the visas of non-European temporary residents, by deterring "health tourism" and by recovering money owed by other countries for NHS treatment their nationals had received. The proposals followed the publication of an independent report commissioned by the Department of Health in London. Speaking during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd, Mr Jones said he had a "curious" conversation with UK government officials at last week's Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in Downing Street, a meeting which involves devolved administrations and UK ministers. He said officials had confirmed that the levy was being imposed to pay for health services but they had told him Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would not get the usual share they receive for areas of government that were devolved. "So it seems this money is going to be collected and used entirely for the health service in England," he said. "It was clear to me they hadn't thought this through in any way, certainly the first minister of Northern Ireland was equally as astounded as I was by the comment." "We in Wales will find ourselves in the situation where we will not receive a share of the money that is specifically collected for the purpose of the delivery of a devolved service. "They need to think again," Mr Jones added. </body>

While most tenders for work are put out to everyone, ministers in Cardiff have adopted a UK government process to evaluate certain schemes. Only one company from Wales is registered to bid. The Welsh government said the process provided value for money. Only one company from Wales is registered with the department responsible in London, which means the others have been unable to bid for more than £800,000 worth of contracts, including a review of the Welsh government's flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme. Another research project involved assessing a Welsh government initiative to increase the amount of goods and services public bodies bought from Welsh companies. The Welsh government says between 80% and 90% of its tenders are open to all. A spokesperson said: "We are committed to encouraging Welsh businesses and higher education institutions to benefit from public sector contracts. We purchase the majority of our research via open tender or via our own procurement framework which does include a number of Welsh businesses. "We occasionally make use of the procurement framework operated by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) which provides good value for money." It said several Welsh organisations had been brought in as sub-contractors. Organisations such as the consultancies, Iaith and Oldbell 3, and the Cardiff Business School have been involved in some projects. The information emerged following freedom of information requests by Plaid Cymru. The party accuses the Welsh government of failing to "practise what it preaches" by allowing some businesses to be "cut out" of some contracts. North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd dismissed the claim that much of the work was sub-contracted back to Wales. "They take their top slice, they pocket that and they sub-contract Welsh companies to actually deliver large parts of the work , but at a fraction of the cost," he said. "So the key issue here is that the Welsh economy is in effect a leaking bucket. "There's a hole in the Welsh economy with all this potential money for Welsh businesses flowing out of Wales. We need to plug that leak." Iestyn Davies, of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Cymru, said: "The government spends significant money through small businesses and large companies and it's important that the value is felt in the communities where those businesses are based. "When you spend money outside of Wales, that money's lost to Wales. "It's a very simple equation. "So good public sector procurement can leave a long-lasting value and legacy within communities. It doesn't matter how big the contract is, it can still have a real impact on a small local business." </body>

      <title>Watkin and Croft have 'major' roles</title>
      <description>New Glamorgan coach Toby Radford gives his backing to bowling coaches Robert Croft and Steve Watkin after beating them to the job.</description>

      <body>New Glamorgan coach Toby Radford says Robert Croft and Steve Watkin have key roles to play under his leadership. Radford takes over as head coach next month - a job for which Watkin and Croft both applied. The former England players are currently employed as bowling coaches at the county, and Caerphilly-born Radford does not see that changing. "I see them playing a major role with the coaching staff as we go forward," he said. Radford, 41, believes their experience as former Test match bowlers knits well with his specialist knowledge of batting. Croft took 1,175 first class wickets during his playing carer with Glamorgan, with Watkin pitching in with 902. Former Middlesex and Sussex batsman Radford joins Glamorgan from the West Indies, where he was assistant coach and batting coach. "They are mainly bowling specialists but I see them working very tightly with me," he said of Croft and Watkin. "I'd like to see a very tight unit with a clear definition of roles all working to the same ends. "I think this winter is when we'll be doing a lot of our work and not just working with our own players but putting plan in place for all the teams we'll come up against in different competitions next year." Radford also believes Glamorgan should be playing in the first division of the county championship instead of languishing near the bottom of division two. "For a side that pretty much represents the whole of Wales has a fantastic ground and a big support base you'd like to think that club would be a first division club," he said. "In one-day cricket [the team were] not too bad, particularly in the 40-over form and got to a one day final at Lord's. "But in championship cricket bottom-but-one in the second division in the four day game. "I think there's a lot of good things there and in many ways now it's time to improve the play in the championship and I'd love to see the side make it into the first division." Improving the form of the county's Welsh-produced players to match that of their key overseas signings will be key to that improvement. Radford believes the team relied too heavily on Australian pace bowler Michael Hogan, Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin and Australian-born but England qualified all-rounder Jim Allenby. "They are a big core to the team," said Radford, while conceding one of his challenges was to bring the other players up their standards. "I'd love to see some of these Welsh lads getting their batting averages up from the mid-20s into the high 30s or early 40s," he added. "There may be little tweaks we can to technically with some of these guys that can make that difference." </body>

      <title>Hook's deal 'frustrates' Gatland</title>
      <description>Warren Gatland says George North's Northampton deal is better for for his Wales career than James Hook's Perpignan contract.</description>

      <body>Warren Gatland says George North has struck a much better deal than James Hook over release from their clubs for Wales duty. The Wales coach is "frustrated" by Hook's Perpignan contract denying the player full release for internationals. But Northampton wing North, signed from Scarlets, is already in Wales' camp ahead of four November Tests. "That was part of the terms and conditions when he signed," said Gatland of North. "He wasn't going anywhere unless he had at least the same release as the Welsh [based] players. "And so that's great for us." However, Gatland is less impressed by the deal Hook as signed with French club Perpignan. Gatland also revealed Wales have released Bath prop Paul James' from the match against Tonga in return for the club releasing the player for the Test against Australia on 30 November. The game against the Wallabies falls outside the International Rugby Board autumn Tests slot, with the earlier clashes against South Africa, Argentina and Tonga falling within it. And the Welsh Rugby Union's policy of holding regular out-of-window games has seen other non-Welsh-based players miss out in the past. Hook left Ospreys ahead of the 2011-12 season and has recently signed a fresh four-year deal with French Top 14 club Perpignan. Gatland says most of Wales' foreign-based players have negotiated "full release". He added: "It does make a difference having that couple of weeks' preparation and them being available for that fourth game in the autumn. "There are one or two that don't have full release and that's sometimes not always easiest when they come a bit late and you're looking at the team trying to put some combinations together. "James Hook is one of them - and Paul James. Bath have come to us and we're going to release him for the Tongan week and they're going to release him for the Australian week." Gatland says Hook is "desperate and hungry to play for Wales". The New Zealander added that when Hook was considering moving to France, he told the player to ensure he had full release for all of Wales' training and playing commitments. Gatland continued: "Unfortunately we were under the impression that his agent had negotiated that, so I'm disappointed that that wasn't done with his agent and other players have been able to do that. "With James not being fully available for all training for all the Six Nations and missing that fourth game in the autumn, it puts him at a disadvantage to other players that are available all the time." However, in North's case Gatland says Wales have been told the British and Irish Lions wing is fully available to them. "It's what we've been told - he's down here training this week; they [Northampton] actually released him a week earlier. "So he's training with us so he's got full release." The WRU and the leading English clubs' umbrella body Premier Rugby Limited have clashed over player-release issues in the past. </body>

      <body>Britain's Anthony Fowler and Andrew Selby secured at least a bronze medal at the World Amateur Championships in Kazakhstan. Fowler, the unseeded 22-year-old from Liverpool, beat German Stefan Hartel - ranked seventh - 2-1 in the quarter-finals of the middleweight class. "It means the world to me and I've trained so hard," Fowler told BBC Sport in Almaty. Welsh flyweight Selby, the top seed, beat Kazakhstan's Ilyas Suleimenov 2-1. Selby, 25, will face Jasurbek Latipov in Friday's semi-final after the Uzbekistan fighter beat Northern Ireland's Paddy Barnes 3-0. The winners of the semi-finals will be guaranteed at least a silver medal. "I never stop until the final bell," said Fowler, who recovered from losing the first round to take the last two against Hartel. "My diet has been spot on, I'm training hard and I'm getting the rewards." Northern Ireland's Michael Conlan - ranked number two - missed out on a medal as he lost all three rounds of his last-eight bantamweight fight with Russia's Vladimir Nikitin, who was ranked eight places below him. Compatriot Tommy McCarthy was beaten by Argentina's number two-ranked Yamil Peralta in their heavyweight quarter-final. "It was a close fight, but I cannot change it so [there is] no point crying about it," said McCarthy. "There are no positives to be taken in losing." </body>

The town council wants the site to be awarded village green status so it can remain open to the public for generations to come. However, the county council is against that saying it would inhibit future options, including any potential development of the site which might benefit the town economically.

      <body>A row over the future of the grounds of an 11th Century castle is due to be settled at a public hearing. Campaigners want to keep Haverfordwest castle grounds open to the public by securing village green status. That would stop the site being used for private redevelopment, such as recent interest in setting up a hotel. Haverfordwest Town Council is behind the application but Pembrokeshire County Council said the plan was flawed and wants to sell off the land. "We feel it is in the best interests of our town to retain its heritage by having the castle left open for public use," said Haverfordwest town councillor Peter Lewis. "It's just one of these places where people feel they should be able to walk at any time. "Haverfordwest castle is what the town has been built around - it is fundamental, it is our iconic building, it pervades everything. "If you look at all of our sports clubs, they carry the castle motif. Everyone sees that as the central feature of our town." The site is owned by Pembrokeshire council and only a few of the original stone walls remain of the 11th Century castle. For decades the public has enjoyed open access. The town museum is housed there and the site is used by people to walk their dogs, eat lunch in fine weather and watch occasional events on the grass. In 2010, Pembrokeshire council announced that it was putting part of the castle site - an old Victorian prison building which for years had been home to the county records office - up for sale. Last year, an architect and developer showed an interest in turning it into an eight to 16-bedroom boutique hotel and restaurant, but it proved controversial. Some time later the developer walked away. The town council decided then that the only way to protect the site for good was to apply for village green status. It has also put in an offer to buy the Victorian prison building for £50,000. Pembrokeshire council said the castle grounds had been declared a public open space in 2009 and the town council had the chance to challenge it but failed to do so. It argues the standing as a public open space means public events in the castle grounds can be organised and managed effectively with the granting of the appropriate licences. Deputy leader Huw George said village green status would change forever what could be done with the site. "It will make it very difficult to regulate who uses it and when they use it and that causes us a great concern," he said. "Our greatest concern is the objection [against development] they've put in, which is by nature flawed. "The objection I believe should've come in 2009 when it was declared a public open space. We're now in 2013, which seems to me a little bit flawed." He added: "By turning it into a village green we curtail many options which may harm the development economically and with tourism in the future, and I think Haverfordwest deserves to have all opportunities left open." Both sides are being represented by a solicitor, and the public hearing will be presided over by the Planning Inspectorate. The hearing, which starts on Wednesday, has been described by the county council as an "unnecessary application" and said it was costing a "great deal of public money at a time when every penny counts". But Mr Lewis said the action was necessary. "It's going to cost us well over £10,000 and it's going to cost the county council more than that to defend it but we feel we've got no choice," he said. </body>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <description>Plan to cope with NHS winter pressure backed by first minister</description>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police are appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Commitee. The meeting took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where Mr Mitchell was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked" during the meeting. The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. The officers have since said they regret giving the statement, but Mr Mitchell's allies have dubbed this a "regretful non-apology" and called for root-and-branch changes to increase police accountability. Asked whether he believed the apology should be the end of the matter, former policing minister Nick Herbert said: "No, I don't think it is enough." The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The wording of the IPCC report, let's just remind ourselves, was incredibly strong. "They suggest that the police officers gave a false account, that there was a deliberate attempt to discredit Andrew Mitchell, that their motives seem plain: they were pursuing a political agenda. "Now when the independent body says this, it is surely right that action is taken and it is very unsatisfactory that we have a situation where the leadership of the police force appears to disagree and take no action in spite of the view of the independent body that was set up to deal with complaints." Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <title>PM to review fixed odds machines</title>
      <description>David Cameron promises to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from High Street betting shops.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to £100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at £100 and the maximum payout at £500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <title>Grangemouth chemical plant to close</title>
      <description>The operator of the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland says the site's petrochemical plant is to close.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24631342</url>

      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <title>Parking ticket 'grace' period urged</title>
      <description>Councils in England should give drivers five minutes grace after their parking tickets run out before fining them, a committee of MPs says.</description>

      <body>Drivers should be given "five minutes grace" after their parking tickets expire before facing fines, MPs on the Commons transport committee say. It also said councils in England should publish annual parking-charge accounts if they want to prove they are not being used as a "cash cow" The Transport Committee warned it was "neither acceptable nor legal" to use fines to increase revenue. Councils made a surplus of hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it added. The MPs urged ministers to freeze charges, currently capped at £130 in London and £70 outside. Councils said money raised went back into services. Committee chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said: "There is a deep-rooted public perception that parking enforcement is used as a cash cow, so it's essential that local authorities apply stringent transparency." The report said the Local Government Association had calculated a surplus from on- and off-street parking of £411m in 2011/12, while the RAC Foundation put the figure at £565m. The maximum fixed penalty for speeding is £60, unless the case is referred to court. Mrs Ellman argued the charging system was perverse, saying: "Annual parking accounts would allow the public to see how much local revenue is derived from the enforcement of fines, and what proportion of this come from on- or off-street parking charges. "It's right that parking charges be determined locally, but hard to justify fines that substantially exceed penalties for more serious offences like speeding. "Central government should freeze the maximum penalty charge and develop differential fines for less serious parking violations. " Mrs Ellman also said the Department for Transport's rules for councils should include a five-minute "grace-and-favour" period after tickets expire before imposing a fine. A government spokesman said: "We welcome this report, which strengthens the case for changes to be made to parking rules. "The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This government is reining in over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair parking practices, with the levels of parking penalty charges being kept under review." But Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said: "As this report recognises, parking controls are not being used by councils to raise revenue. They are essential for keeping motorists and pedestrians safe, traffic flowing and ensure people can park near their homes and local shops." He added: "Councils always look to be open and transparent with residents on their parking policies. "Any income they make from charges and fines is spent on running parking services, fixing potholes and providing subsidised travel to children and the elderly." Last month, the government said it was considering banning fixed cameras and so-called "spy cars" used by councils to catch people parking illegally. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the idea of getting councils to publish figures, saying it would "illuminate what many drivers regard as the murky world of parking policy". "Parking charges are not inherently wrong but they need to be fair, and where penalties are levied they should be proportionate to the 'crime' committed. "Local authorities are struggling with huge financial pressures but so are drivers. It is unacceptable that car users should be singled out as an easy way of shoring up shrinking budgets." </body>

      <title>Benefit cap 'not achieving aims'</title>
      <description>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its objectives of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than £500 a week, while a £350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given £1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add £2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <description>Former prime minister Sir John Major calls for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms.</description>

      <body>Former prime minister Sir John Major has called for an emergency tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. The ex-Conservative leader said recent price rises of more than 10% were "unacceptable" and action was needed. The government could claw back the cost of extra winter fuel payments through a one-off tax, he suggested. Downing Street said there was no such plan but called Sir John's comments "interesting". Energy firms said they were helping customers keep bills down. Ministers have rejected a call by Labour leader Ed Miliband for a price freeze, describing it as a "con" and urging hard-pressed consumers to switch suppliers instead. Three of the "big six" energy firms - Npower, SSE, and British Gas - have announced plans to raise gas and electricity bills by between 8% and 10%. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit with similar price increases. Speaking at a lunch for political journalists, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - said price rises of this kind were not justified and it would be "entirely reasonable" for the government to impose a one-off levy to recover the cost of cold weather payments this winter. Cold weather payments are triggered when the temperature falls below a certain level for a prolonged period. Those on income support and other work-related benefits are eligible for a £25 payment if temperatures drop to zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. Fuel poverty campaigners have said the price rises will leave some people with the choice of having to "heat or eat" this winter but energy firms say they are needed to cover the cost of rising wholesale prices and environmental obligations. Asked about Labour's plan for price freeze if it is elected in 2015, Sir John said "Ed Miliband's heart was in the right place but his head has gone walkabout", adding that the plan was unworkable. "But he did touch on an issue that's very important. The private sector is something the Conservative party support but when the private sector goes wrong or behaves badly I think it is entirely right to make changes and put it right. "At the moment I do not see how it can be in any way acceptable that with energy prices rising broadly 4% in terms of costs that the price to the consumer should rise by the 9-10% that we are hearing." He later told the BBC that the was a "crisis" in the energy market and there was a "very real chance" that the government would have to increase the amount of assistance it gave to people in the event of cold snap. Should this happen, he said a "one-off retrospective" tax should be considered "given the scale of their (energy firms') profits and the unjustified nature of the price increases they have just proposed". The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the prime minister and his chancellor were instinctively opposed to short-term fixes and believed only action on competition and supply would reduce bills. But he said intervention from such a senior figure would increase pressure on them to do something. In response to the ex-PM's comments, Ed Miliband tweeted: "Sir John Major makes Labour's argument: David Cameron stands up for the energy companies not hard-pressed families." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the former PM was "joining a chorus of voices who are concerned about the way the public has been left out of pocket". But she said Labour opposed a windfall tax, as it would be complicated and it was unclear how it would benefit consumers, while a price freeze was a "simple measure" to give consumers immediate respite. The government has said the price rises are "disappointing" but has insisted a price freeze could actually lead to higher prices in the long-term and what is needed is more competition. "There are a number of initiatives that the government has to support vulnerable people, such as the cold weather payments," a No 10 spokesman said. "We have a range of ways in which support is given and those are the right ones." Conservative business minister Michael Fallon said: "It's an interesting idea but we think a faster way to bear down on prices is more competition, simpler tariffs and making it much easier for people to switch to a cheaper supplier." The Energy UK trade association said: "No one should be afraid to put the heating on this winter. If customers are worried they should get in touch with their energy supplier and they should be able to help. "The energy industry is doing an increasing amount to help vulnerable customers and we will be looking at what more can be done to help people worried about their bills." The bosses of the leading energy firms have been called to appear before MPs next week to explain the price rises. Earlier on Tuesday, Scottish Power was told to pay £8.5m to many of its customers after being found to have misled them about the benefits of switching to alternative suppliers and other breaches of its licence obligations. More than 140,000 customers on the warm homes discount schemes, designed to support those at risk of fuel poverty, will receive about £50 in compensation each. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May says.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea" and were too much of a "blunt instrument". Labour said Mrs May must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the policy. Explaining her decision to ditch the campaign in the Commons, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid" while UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it elsewhere. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. "This is a failed project and the Home Office should hold their hands up and admit it was wrong both practically and morally," he said. But Labour said it "beggared belief" that the Lib Dems were trying to "claim victory for ending a policy that they signed off in the first place". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her Conservative counterpart must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the idea. "You agreed to that slogan," she said during heated exchanges in the Commons. "And you agreed to send it round communities whose parents heard it from the National Front in the 1970s and whose British citizens work in our public services, build our businesses and fight in our armed forces today. "You signed this policy off, you defended it, all for the sake of one person returning. You should be better than that. I hope you are ashamed of what you did. "You should confirm that you will never pursue such divisive gimmicks again. It is beneath you and it ought to be beneath this government." Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <description>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, ministers from the Friends of Syria group of countries say.</description>

      <body>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, the Friends of Syria group of countries has said. The talks in Geneva next month offered Syrians the "best hope to improve their lives", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Ministers had gathered in London to meet Syrian opposition officials. A key group in Syria's main opposition alliance has threatened to boycott the planned meeting, dubbed Geneva II. Mr Hague's US counterpart John Kerry said he believed and hoped the meeting would go ahead as planned but that Western countries could not control whether all parties would attend. Addressing the opposition, Mr Kerry said: "You can win at the negotiating table what it may take a long time and a lot of... loss of life to win on the battlefield." Ahmad Jarba, head of the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), said the coalition would decide at a meeting next week whether to participate. The SNC has previously been unwilling to talk to representatives of Mr Assad's government. Mr Hague said the process envisaged by the Friends of Syria involved the establishment "by mutual consent" of "a transitional governing body with full executive powers". Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. Mr Hague reaffirmed the view of the Friends of Syria group - Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States - that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Any transitional government could only be agreed with the consent of the SNC, and therefore Mr Assad would play no role in it, Mr Hague added. Mr Kerry said he expected representatives of the government to attend any talks and to "negotiate in good faith". Mr Hague and Mr Kerry also pledged further backing for Syria's moderate opposition, aimed at bolstering them in the face of rising influence extremists from power in the war-gripped country. Mr Jarba also spoke to reporters after the meeting, outlining the steps that he considered necessary for the success of the Geneva talks, including: Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague earlier told the BBC he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role". Also on Tuesday, the UN Special Co-ordinator for the mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag, said in a statement that to date, the Syrian government had "fully co-operated" in the mission's work. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. On Monday, Mr Assad told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run for the presidency again in 2014. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. After Tuesday's meeting, Mr Kerry was asked about reports quoting the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, as saying his country would make a "major shift" in its relations with the US because of Saudi impatience with perceived Western inaction on Syria. Mr Kerry played down the report, insisting the two countries were "on the same page". More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, including 5.2 million who will have fled the country. </body>

      <title>'Plebgate has hit trust' in police</title>
      <description>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police after accusations of misconduct by officers in the "Plebgate" row, a poll for the BBC finds.</description>

      <body>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police in the wake of "Plebgate", a poll for the BBC found. Despite accusations officers lied to undermine then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, the ComRes survey of 1,000 people found 82% are still likely to believe what the police say. Mr Mitchell has denied calling police "plebs" outside Downing Street. Officers from the police union in his constituency have apologised for "poor judgement" over the affair. The apology came after a transcript emerged of a meeting they had attended with Mr Mitchell, then government chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said the officers misrepresented him at a press conference after the meeting, which the minister had called to defuse the row with police. The BBC's poll asked how the affair had affected people's "opinion" of the police. While 67% said it had made "no difference", 26% responded that it had made them "slightly less" or "much less" likely to trust the police. Only 5% said the affair had increased their trust in the police. The poll suggests public trust overall remains high, with 82% saying they were "very likely" or "fairly likely" to believe officers speaking either on television or on the streets while on duty. But it found that 40% agreed with the statement: "Generally, the police seem to try to cover up wrongdoing by those in its ranks." And in Mr Mitchell's West Midlands region as well as in Scotland and among skilled manual workers, overall trust was fractionally lower, with one in five saying they were unlikely to believe what officers say. The three officers accused by the IPCC of having tried to discredit Mr Mitchell are due to appear before MPs on the influential Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. The inspector who investigated the comments made by the officers after the meeting has also been called to appear. But the Police and Crime Commissioner for one of the forces concerned accused friends of the ex-minister of "baying for blood" over the affair. Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball said Mr Mitchell and his supporters should have accepted the Police Federation's apology. Conservative backbencher David Davis has said the officers should "face the consequences" of what he described as their "deliberate misconduct". </body>

      <title>Would-be MPs 'should be vetted'</title>
      <description>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, says former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell.</description>

      <body>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, a former cabinet secretary has suggested. Lord O'Donnell - once the UK's most senior civil servant - said the idea could make Parliament more effective. Government policies would also be vetted by former ministers, accountants and ex-civil servants under Lord O'Donnell's proposals. He said radical change was needed as the country was in a "bad place". In an article for The Political Quarterly, the former civil service chief said: Lord O'Donnell did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet. But a Cabinet Office source dismissed the idea. The source said: "It is not clear who would oversee the pre-qualification of Parliamentary candidates, and for what purpose. At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It's called democracy" Lord O'Donnell said MPs could get training to prepare them for jobs as ministers. He wrote: "There are very few jobs that do not require individuals to undertake training and development before being promoted, so this would bring MPs into line with the reality of their constituents' lives." A new body called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility would be established to vet both government policies and opposition manifestos. He wrote: "The rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer's and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it." Falling potential economic growth and an increasing demand on public services created a "vicious pincer movement", he said. Voters were put off politics by the way politicians behaved on occasions like Prime Minister's Questions, and some new MPs were already disillusioned with their jobs. They increasingly faced a choice between free, but second rate, public services and expensive private provision. "We are in a bad place," wrote the former cabinet secretary. "But it is a stable bad place." Despite rejecting Lord O'Donnell's ideas for parliamentary candidates, the Cabinet Office source accepted improvements were needed. He said: "The current leadership of the Civil Service have identified serious deficiencies in capabilities, in talent management and development, and in a culture that too often stifles innovation and has a bias to inertia. "That's why together we are implementing a programme of Civil Service reform to deal with these issues which had been ignored for far too long." </body>

      <title>Facebook adds alerts to death clips</title>
      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24628909</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637328_facebook.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>UK aims to claw back EU welfare cash</title>

      <body>The UK is examining ways to claw back welfare payments made to migrants from other EU countries from their home government, the BBC understands. A levy could be put in place so that for the first two years that a migrant was in the UK, the government would be able to reclaim any benefits paid out. The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was "possible to return to the system". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a "right to reside" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be "habitually resident". Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims "might not raise huge sums," the senior Foreign Office source said, "but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring. In January 2014, restrictions that have applied to migrants from Romania and Bulgaria to the UK will expire. Meanwhile, the UK is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK. It is alleged the extra UK "right to reside" test to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. The government has said it will fight the court case robustly. Ministers are keen to be seen to be adopting a muscular approach to immigration, given how big a priority opinion polls suggest it is to many voters, and the recent strong performances of the UK Independence Party. </body>

      <title>Labour backs May's Immigration Bill</title>
      <description>Labour votes for government plans to toughen the immigration system by cutting back on benefit payments and grounds for appeal against deportation.</description>

      <body>Labour has backed government plans to toughen the immigration system by cutting back on benefit payments and grounds for appeal against deportation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs her party would not oppose the Immigration Bill but "amend and reform it" as it went through Parliament. It contained some "sensible" ideas but offered "nothing" to ensure immigrants would not be used to undercut wages. But Home Secretary Theresa May said the bill would make the UK "fairer". It was passed by 303 votes to 18 and will move on to further scrutiny by MPs. Among the opponents were six Labour MPs and three Liberal Democrats. The legislation, put forward by the government earlier this month, would make landlords question tenants about their migration status and cut bank account access for those in the UK illegally. Ministers also want to make it easier to deport foreign criminals and cut the number of grounds for appeal. Also among the plans debated by MPs on Tuesday are: Mrs May said the changes would simplify a "labyrinthine" system, adding: "The bill will clamp down on the those who live in the UK illegally and take advantage of our services. "That's not fair to the British public and it's not fair to the legitimate migrants who contribute to our society and our economy." The home secretary added: "Fixing the immigration system is not something that can be done overnight. "There were too many problems with the system that we inherited for that to be possible. However, this bill will help us further along that road." There had been uncertainty over whether Labour would oppose the bill. But, during her speech, Ms Cooper announced: "We will not oppose the bill today, as we believe that it should go through to committee stage so we can amend and reform it and use this opportunity to introduce better, fairer controls to deal with this government's failures and make immigration work for all." She said: "The real gap in this Immigration Bill is that it says nothing about exploitation of immigration in the workplace." Ms Cooper added: "This bill doesn't do what it claims. Some of its measures are sensible, some confused, some of serious concern. It claims to tackle illegal immigration, but does nothing of the sort." The bill is undergoing its second reading debate, during which MPs discuss the main principles. The government says it will help the aim of reducing net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to fewer than 100,000 a year. But Ms Cooper said the bill offered "nothing" to deal with exploitation of illegal workers or problems at border controls. Labour's amendments include: There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000, but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was closer to 1.1 million. </body>

      <title>Energy bosses called before MPs</title>
      <description>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms are being called before MPs to give evidence about recent price rises.</description>

      <body>Bosses from the UK's six biggest energy firms have been called to give evidence to MPs about recent price rises. The Energy and Climate Change Committee will quiz the bosses on 29 October. In the past two weeks, three of the "big six" energy firms have announced gas and electricity price rises. Npower's dual-fuel bills will go up by 10.4% on 1 December, SSE will increase prices by 8.2% from 15 November and British Gas's prices are due to rise by 9.2% on 23 November. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit by increasing prices. Scottish Power, which has just been hit with a penalty by regulator Ofgem after sales staff misled customers, said it faced the same cost pressures as competitors and was likely to "move on prices" before the end of the year. The chairman of the committee of MPs, Sir Robert Smith, said: "The committee has today decided to call in the energy bosses in the context of the latest wave of price increases." The committee said the session would examine the "reasons and justification" behind recent price rises, the difference of pricing policies between the firms, and how "the transparency of energy company profits can be improved". The energy companies have argued that the price rises were the result of higher wholesale costs, increased costs in delivering energy to customers' homes, and the effect of the levy charged to companies to fund environmental measures. The recent energy price increases have coincided with considerable political debate about the cost of gas and electricity to households. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But Prime Minister David Cameron has branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan a "con", saying that he does not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir John Major has called for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. </body>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested £150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBC… was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around £5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost £2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new £150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <title>82% 'support organ donation changes'</title>

      <body>More than 80% of respondents to consultation on organ donation changes would support a new opt-out system, an assembly member has said. The change would require people to opt out of donation rather than opt in. Currently people commit by signing a donor card but this system means that two out of three people are not registered. Assembly member Jo-Anne Dobson, who supports an opt-out system, said 82.42% of the 1,366 respondents backed it. Among them were several charities, political parties and local councils. More than 1,300 of the response came from members of the public. In all, 82.69% of people who responded supported a change to the current law. The proposed changes would continue to consider the wishes of the family and safeguard children and young people under 18, those who do not have the capacity to consent, those who are not normally resident in Northern Ireland and those whose identity is unknown. "As chair of the All Party Group on Organ Donation I am pleased that the issue has been raised and debated regularly at our meetings and that opportunity has been afforded to those in favour, as well as those who hold reservations towards a soft opt-out system, to address and engage with the members of the committee," Ms Dobson said. She said the next stage would be to "proceed to formal drafting of the Bill and the feedback provided by the 1,366 consultation responses will be invaluable to me in this process". A total of 123 transplants took place in 2012/13 in Northern Ireland, and 190 people were on the transplant waiting list as of March 2013 About 15 people die each year while waiting for a transplant. </body>

      <title>Sauna 'sex items' ban call withdrawn</title>
      <description>Calls for a ban on items of a sexual nature in Edinburgh's licensed saunas are withdrawn.</description>

      <body>Calls for a ban on items of a sexual nature in Edinburgh's licensed saunas have been withdrawn. Police Scotland had written to councillors asking that licences should only be granted on the condition such items were not allowed on the premises. Safe sex campaigners were angered by the move, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. However, the condition was withdrawn from the council committee without any discussion. And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. Councillors granted new licenses to five of 13 city saunas. They are due to decide in private later whether the remaining eight saunas are also to be granted new licenses. Earlier this year, six other saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". </body>

      <title>Cancer patient waiting times improve</title>
      <description>Waiting times for cancer treatment improve but health boards are still failing to meet the target for treating the most urgent cases.</description>

      <body>Waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales have improved according to the latest figures. However, all Welsh health boards are still failing to meet the Welsh government's target for treating the most urgent cases. Figures for August show that 88.6% of urgent cancer patients had started definitive treatment within 62 days of diagnosis - up from 84.5% in July. The target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in that time scale. Conservative Shadow Health Minister, Darren Millar AM, said: "Any improvement is a step in the right direction but it is clear that more progress is urgently required. "This is a critically-important target that hasn't been met in five years." Figures for August released by the Welsh government on Wednesday also show 98.5% of patients started treatment within 31 days through the non-urgent route, compared to 98.2% the previous month. There was a small improvement in waiting times for other cancer cases. But none of the six health boards that provide cancer care met the Welsh government's target of providing definitive treatment for the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days. This target has not been met on an all-Wales basis for several years. Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying experience. "It is appalling that people are being forced to wait over two months until the start of their treatment." Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones said despite some signs of improvement, waiting times for people with cancer remained "unacceptable". "A Plaid Cymru government would provide all cancer patients with a specialist cancer nurse to guide them through treatment and rehabilitation," she said. The Welsh government has been asked to comment. </body>

      <title>Heseltine plea on 'decaying' towns</title>
      <description>A magazine article which suggested that government money should no longer be spent on some deprived English towns and cities is criticised by former cabinet minister Lord Heseltine.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24630952</url>
      <date>1382540344</date>

      <body>The former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed claims that "failing" towns and cities should be abandoned by the government. An article in The Economist suggested that a number of industrial towns were "decaying" and their inhabitants should be encouraged to find jobs elsewhere. The magazine listed Hull, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as places where "dollops of public money" had failed to boost the local economy, despite years of heroic effort. The article has caused an outcry in Hull, where the city council leader described its recommendations as "disgusting". In an interview for the Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Lord Heseltine said similar claims were made about Liverpool in the 1980s. Michael Heseltine was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to lead the regeneration of Liverpool, following riots in the city in 1981. The former Conservative cabinet minister claims the best way to stimulate economic growth in deprived towns and cities is to devolve more power away from Whitehall. Lord Heseltine said: "What I have argued over decades is that we should say to cities what would you do? "Because you know what Leeds needs, what Bradford needs and what Hull needs." Former Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle told me there had been numerous calls over the years to turn-off the government spending taps on Merseyside. Mr Kilfoyle, who served as a Labour minister under Tony Blair, said: "We had a think-tank a few years ago which said that Liverpool should be abandoned and everybody should move to the south. "This is nonsense. Any forward looking government would want to invest in Hull, just as they invested in Liverpool." Cabinet papers from 1981 reveal the chancellor of the exchequer at the time - Sir Geoffrey Howe - raised the possibility of a programme of "managed decline" in Liverpool. However, Lord Howe recently said there was never a suggestion that Liverpool should be abandoned by the Conservative government in the 1980s. </body>

      <title>Labour councils and Pickles in row</title>
      <description>As Labour-run local authorities warn over new cuts, Eric Pickles accuses them of "shroud waving".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24627811</url>

      <body>The battle lines are being drawn. Within the next few months, our large local authorities will outline where the spending axe will fall on local services. It's become an annual fixture in the political calendar. By the end of this parliament, councils will have seen their budgets squeezed by one third, with the prospect of further cuts after the next general election. But in the East Midlands, there are two new players. Both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are now Labour controlled; and since the party's victory in May's local elections, hardly a day has passed without a dire warning of the tough choices having to be taken by the new leadership to balance the books. The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles this week got his retaliation in first. He told MPs that complaining Labour authorities were more interested in "shroud-waving" and cutting front-line services. He's also been brushing down his "50 Ways to Save", his guide to councils to make the most of their budgets. It'll be no surprise that the leader of Derbyshire county council, Labour's Anne Western, takes a very different view of the financial challenges facing her authority in the next budget round. "You can either shrink and shrink your services until there's nothing left, or we can reinvent what we do," she told me. "In the six months since we took control, we've been talking to partners like the NHS. Our priority is what the people of Derbyshire want." That may be music to the ears of the Communities Secretary. He's been encouraging councils to reach out to other organisations to share costs. "To be frank, this is the future," he said. "It makes sense to work together on procurement, joint use of offices and shared services." One key area for Anne Western is the provision of council-run residential care services for the elderly. Derbyshire has 26 such care homes and spends £72m annually on care services, one of the highest of any shire county. Many of its neighbouring authorities have already sold-off or part-privatised the service. Anne Western said: "People get a huge sense of confidence when the service is council-run because of the quality of the staff and the training. It's also more accountable." Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister dismissed warnings from Anne Western over the consequences of budget cuts on services and jobs in Derbyshire. He described additional council cuts following the chancellor's budget as "relatively modest". "He's just playing with numbers," replied Anne Western. "It's not just me as a Labour leader. There are Conservative leaders up and down the country arguing the case for a rethink on budgets." Rethink? From the Communities Secretary? That may look unlikely. What's more likely is Eric Pickles quoting from a recent BBC/ ICM survey . It indicated that many people believe local council services - rubbish collection, libraries and schools - have actually improved in the past few years. In the months ahead, watch out for those battle lines being drawn. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44.

      <description>Focus on growth ahead of EU summit</description>

      <body>The summer is past and European summits return. Europe's leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday with the markets becalmed and some economic statistics to celebrate. Even the threat - a few weeks back - of the Italian government falling scarcely ruffled the markets. The promise by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, a year ago, to do whatever it takes to defend the euro continues to act as a shield against the bond market vigilantes. No one, it seems, is prepared to bet against the ECB. It is true that almost on a daily basis there are reassuring signs of progress. The Spanish economy has just edged out of recession after two years. Since 2008 its exports have grown by an impressive 14.6%. Unemployment at above 26% may have peaked. Italy is running a trade surplus and Greece this year will register a primary budget surplus excluding debt repayments. Ireland is set to exit its bailout programme in mid-December. And yet despite all the austerity and spending cuts the level of debt, amongst the countries that use the eurozone, is still rising. French unemployment, which was down in August, is set to rise again. Italy is struggling to bring down its labour costs without which it cannot be competitive. The Greeks are locked in argument with their lenders over a budget gap. It may need further funding. It was revealed this week that Greeks are, on average, 40% poorer than in 2008. Even the most Panglossian of Europe's leaders recognises that the recovery is fragile and solid growth is needed so in Brussels the leaders will concentrate on supporting and expanding the digital economy and building a single digital market. Discussions on telecoms, copyright, data protection, credit card payments and digital signatures can appear dry but are all central to what potentially will be the fastest growing economic sector in the future. UK Prime Minister David Cameron will try to focus the dinner conversation on reducing red tape and on revealing the cost of EU regulations to the business community. The difficulty for the European heads of government is that many of these ideas and initiatives take time when there are 26 million people out of work in the EU. Growth of at least 1.5% is needed to start reducing the unemployment lines. In the short term, the most important step is to make it easier for small- and medium-sized companies to borrow at affordable rates. Even while the focus is on growth, important decisions about the euro lie ahead but they cannot be taken whilst Germany is still in the process of forming its coalition government. Almost certainly those decisions will not be taken at this summit. The eurozone has agreed on a banking supervisor but it has not agreed on a resolution mechanism for winding up failing banks. The Germans do not want to pick up the bill. Yet cleaning up the banks remains the eurozone's biggest challenge. In Germany there is much discussion about Chancellor Angela Merkel's supposed plan for the eurozone. The idea is probably less developed than presented but countries would have to accept binding contracts which would give Brussels more power over national budgets and even social security and pensions. If that was to happen, the Germans say it would require treaty change and that is strongly opposed by the French. What all this underlines is that in the months and years ahead, Europe will still be building up its defences against the crisis re-occurring. On Friday the leaders will discuss migration from Africa and the Middle East and the need to prevent further tragedies at sea as occurred off the island of Lampedusa. Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said: "The EU has proved unable to forge a harmonised immigration policy... It is not even able to rescue those who still believe in the European dream." Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has said that Europe "cannot sit there and watch" and has called for "immediate action". There is a general consensus that Europe needs to do more but almost all plans run up against difficulties. Perhaps the least controversial step is to put more resources into Frontex, the agency that patrols the Mediterranean. Others want to see the EU doing more to prevent migrants reaching the Libyan border. The EU already has a mission in the country but it has been frustrated at almost every level. Libya's borders are now so porous that persuading Tripoli to patrol its own shoreline is unrealistic. Some leaders will want an open discussion about "burden-sharing" and a change to asylum policy but this is politically sensitive. Very rapidly a discussion about migration can become one about "the free movement of people" within the EU. There will be expressions of solidarity but if there are to be major decisions about migration and asylum, they may not take place until June next year after the European elections. So as Europe's leaders come to Brussels their crisis is less acute but the questions remain: how can the EU deliver growth, what further steps towards integration are needed and what does solidarity mean in a union of nation states? All of these questions will be argued over in the year ahead. </body>

      <title>Leadership - Fergie's recipe</title>
      <description>What Sir Alex said to Tony Blair about sacking Gordon Brown</description>

      <body>Loyalty, control, discipline. Those are the ingredients of leadership. So says the man who I once teasingly described as "the greatest living Briton". Sir Alex Ferguson was launching his new autobiography today. I went along to Fergie's news conference to ask the man known simply as "the boss" whether the qualities that make a great leader on and off the pitch can be transferred to other fields and, in particular, to politics. What leaders have to do, he told me, was to create loyalty in their staff, transmit their philosophy and exert control and discipline. Leadership, he says, is a quality which allows your personality to transfer to everyone. Interestingly his book, though largely about football, does include a revelation about his involvement in politics. He denies a claim made in Tony Blair's memoirs that he had advised the former prime minister to sack Gordon Brown. Ferguson's recollection is that while Blair asked him how to handle superstars and not Brown in particular. The advice was clear and is a theme of this book - "the minute they threaten your control, you have to get rid of them". Fergie describes himself as being "on the left" of the Labour party, "closer to Brown (than Blair) in principle" but accepting that "Blair's more populist way was the route to get elected". Today the questions all focussed on the big footballing names Sir Alex struggled to control or to compete with - Beckham, Keane, Mourinho and the rest. There are many more I would love to ask about how a leader inspires loyalty, maintains control and instils discipline. My colleague David Bond's interview with Sir Alex will run soon. </body>

      <title>Graphics: Europe's asylum seekers</title>
      <description>In graphics - who is seeking asylum in Europe?</description>

      <body>Syria's brutal civil war is pushing a new wave of migrants towards Europe. Their numbers have surged, but many asylum seekers in Europe have also fled the conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. European governments are struggling to co-ordinate their response to the influx. Large movements of migrants from country to country quickly fuel suspicions that some politicians are trying to shift the burden onto their neighbours. Greece and Italy - major entry points for migrants - say there must be more burden-sharing in the EU, especially as they have been hit hard by the eurozone crisis. Migrants continue to board overcrowded, rickety boats, risking their lives. The recent deaths of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean highlighted their plight. Asylum is granted to those who say they are fleeing persecution and who can convince the authorities that they would face harm or even death if they were to be sent back. Nearly a quarter of asylum applications in the EU are handled by Germany. France is the second biggest destination for asylum seekers. But often English-speaking migrants head for the UK, which is home to large communities from Pakistan, Somalia and Middle Eastern countries. Among the asylum seekers from Russia there are many Chechens, whose homeland was devastated by war between separatist rebels and Russian troops. The asylum seekers from Serbia include many Roma and ethnic Albanians, who complain of discrimination in Serbia. The global asylum picture shows the US is the top destination for asylum seekers, but Germany and France are second and third. Sweden, with a much smaller population, is fourth, ahead of the UK. Europe is the main destination for asylum seekers by far. For many of them it is easier to reach overland or by boat, especially those fleeing conflicts in the Middle East or Africa. And people traffickers already have well-established smuggling routes to Europe. The figures illustrate why immigration has become such a hot topic in Europe. Globally Afghanistan ranks first in terms of asylum seekers' country of origin. But the war in Syria has pushed that country into second place. China and Pakistan are also major countries of origin. Both countries have minorities and dissidents who oppose the government. </body>

      <body>When is regime change not regime change? That in a sense is the dilemma of British and much of Western policy towards Syria. There is no doubt that Britain - like many other governments - would like to see the back of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Britain's policy is not "regime change" if by that is meant the forcible removal of President Assad from power by outside military intervention. The approach taken to oust the Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi is not seen as either practical or appropriate for Syria. The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has always insisted that the agency of change in Syria must be the Syrian people themselves. Britain is certainly backing key elements of the opposition forces - those represented here in London at a meeting with Arab and Western foreign ministers - under the umbrella body the Syrian National Coalition. But Britain's stated goal is a political transition in the country, agreed at the negotiating table, whereby President Assad effectively gives up power. Mr Hague reiterated the primacy of the political track in his comments ahead of the London meeting between the Syrian National Coalition and their key backers among Western and Arab governments. "We want the moderate opposition in Syria to know that we are behind them in going to Geneva," said Mr Hague, "and that we will continue to help them in many ways and to persuade them that this is the only way to solve this tragic and bloody conflict in Syria. There has to be a political process." Of course there have been moments when Britain has been ready to take a very different tack. The British government was willing to participate in military action to punish the Syrian regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons. But the British Parliament was not ready to sanction military force and neither was the US Congress - when push came to shove, military action was removed from the agenda. Of course, the real question is whether the British approach to Syria is likely to succeed in leading to a political transition, and more significantly, what kind of Syria would such a transition produce? The fact is that options are limited. There are only a few levers through which influence can be exerted, and in the final analysis the situation on the ground inside Syria is for now probably just too complex to be amenable to outside diplomatic solutions. Britain, like many other Western governments, threw its weight behind the moderate opposition in Syria in response to the repression of President Assad's government. Before that, President Assad had been something of a favourite of the West, courted especially by London and Paris. Policy in the early stages of the Syrian conflict was heavily influenced by the then limited experience of the "Arab Spring", which was still seen as a broadly positive movement under which tyrannical regimes were overthrown by popular pressure from below. Syria was seen as just the latest such regime to come under threat. Hindsight is wonderful thing. Quite what alternative policy options were open is unclear. But the initial rosy glow of Arab empowerment has given way to a more nuanced and in many cases conflicted analysis. The Arab Spring has overthrown governments offering a measure of stability and unleashed forces that in some cases are antithetical to the democratic values many believed the Arab Spring enshrined. The dilemmas have been seen most profoundly in Egypt where a successor and elected Islamist government was itself overthrown by what many would regard as a military coup. The problems in Syria have manifested themselves even before the collapse of the government. Jihadist groups hold sway in some areas of the country. More moderate Islamists with a largely Syrian agenda are increasingly prominent among the armed groups combating the government on the ground. Many of these groups too are not eager to sit down with President Assad's people in Geneva. Britain is seeking to deal with what it calls "the moderate" opposition. It's an opposition made very much in its own image. Would be democrats, exiles, technocrats, the sort of people Britain and other Western governments believe could create a new open and democratic Syria. But how representative are these groups of the factions on the ground? How well are they linked into the fragmented and volatile world of the opposition? And crucially could they hold power against other centrifugal forces if the political process ever does arrive at the transition that Western governments and many Syrians crave? </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <title>David Beckham inspires philosophy</title>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Obese children 'should keep diaries'</title>
      <description>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England.</description>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness.

      <title>Near-drowned woman can pursue payout</title>
      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <title>N Ireland 'UK's happiest nation'</title>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <body>A so-called university sold an MBA degree for thousands of pounds with no academic work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation has revealed. The American University of London (AUOL) awarded a fictitious person created by the programme a Master's in Business in exchange for a £4,500 fee. AUOL has insisted it is "not a bogus university" and defended the robustness of the qualifications it offers. Newsnight has found hundreds of senior executives listing AUOL qualifications. The programme contacted some of them, but they all insisted that they had had to study for their degrees. AUOL styles itself as a pioneer of distance learning, offering degrees and post-graduate qualifications in business, IT, law, education and liberal arts, humanities, and English to more than 100,000 students worldwide. Its website claims that that all of their courses "have been designed to the most exacting standards, in accordance with the most stringent criteria, in order to provide outstanding education at an affordable price". However, Newsnight found that getting the university to provide a qualification without any study at all was easy. The programme drew up a one-page fake CV for a management consultant Peter Smith, known as Pete, living in South London, which included 15 years of made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree from a UK university. The real Pete was actually a dog living in Battersea Dogs' Home. Newsnight sent "Pete's" CV to AUOL, along with a completed application for the Master's in Business (MBA) and £50 application fee. AUOL also requires applicants to provide photocopies of previous qualifications and a photograph of themselves. However, Newsnight was unable to provide either since the qualifications did not exist and the applicant was a dog. Despite these omissions, just four days after sending in the application, AUOL sent "Pete" an e-mail saying that his application for a degree based on previous experience had been successful and that once the university had received his £4,500 fee he would be registered as an MBA graduate within about two weeks. When Newsnight's reporter telephoned to check whether "Pete" would be required to submit any work, a university representative said: "No, no, apparently the APEL [Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning] board awarded him the full degree immediately based on his qualification and his professional experience, so he doesn't have to do any courses." We showed our written application to Jan Bamford at London Met University which runs properly accredited MBA courses. She was incredulous that a degree could be awarded to someone "with such limited work experience and such a poor application". "I find it incredible that any organisation is awarding an MBA on what essentially amounts to the evidence that is on a piece of paper. That's appalling. Really appalling. And again it goes to the very heart of the fact the government needs to regulate this behaviour," she added. In order to hand out a British degree an institution has to be recognised by Parliament. However, it is perfectly legal to give the impression that a university is run in the UK even when in reality it is incorporated overseas. AUOL is one such place - seemingly based in London, but actually incorporated in St Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, as they state on their website. Despite its name, AUOL does not seem to have any physical presence in London. Newsnight found that the university's phone number is a Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, area code and that the bank that university fees are paid to is in Beaconsfield. According to public records, including the electoral roll, Professor Michael Nimier, who was the founder of AUOL, and Sonia Grimes, who is the registrar, live in the town. On its website, AUOL boasts some well qualified supervisors and says that "the university's academic staff are highly qualified and experienced". But when we contacted five Western academics on its list, all said they had never worked there and never agreed for their name to be used. George Gollin, an American academic with expertise in unaccredited education, told Newsnight that AUOL "did not stand up to scrutiny". "It doesn't have authority to award degrees. They are not degrees. They are pieces of paper and I'm guessing they are not able to sell very many degrees into countries where English is the first language." The university says most of its graduates study at independent colleges in countries overseas. Those affiliates are apparently independent with their own staff subject to their own local laws. AUOL simply takes a fee to help set the curricula and issue graduation certificates in its own name. On professional social networking sites Newsnight found hundreds of senior executives who said they had qualifications from AUOL. The programme spoke to a number of them, all of whom insisted that they did have to submit work to get their degrees. Dr Robert Oakes, a psychologist from Birmingham, who gives expert testimony in court cases, was awarded a PhD just five months after first submitting work. However, he told the programme that he had spent 18 months on his own background research prior to this and he was already a registered psychologist based on a previous degree. Dr Oakes said he believed AUOL was properly accredited, but that he has now taken the qualification off his CV. Dr Rita Bowser, a senior nuclear industry executive who was in charge of selling a new generation of reactors in the UK, was awarded a doctorate in business after submitting what she described as "significant amounts of coursework". Her employer, Westinghouse, said she is well qualified for her job based on 30 years of experience and two previous degrees including a master's from the respected Georgia Tech. Since AUOL is not properly accredited it is not possible to verify how much work they did, nor what standard was required. The university has claimed to be recognised by three different American institutions, but these institutions are themselves unofficial and unrecognised. The university is listed as "bogus" by the agency that values degrees for the Italian government and it has been blacklisted in five US states, including Texas where it is illegal to use any of its qualifications to get a job. In a statement AUOL told Newsnight: "We are not a bogus university… and have always been upfront about our status. We have not applied for accreditation with any American, British or other official agency. Many graduates go on to higher education or hold important positions on the strength of our degrees." The university added that most of its study modules are on a par with those used by top distance learning universities and that it only issues degrees based on work experience in exceptional circumstances. </body>

      <title>'Students need eating-disorder help'</title>
      <description>Students with eating disorders can struggle to get treatment they need while at university, says a charity.</description>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." The National Union of Students (NUS) said it was working to make support for mental health issues a higher priority in universities and colleges. Vice-president Colum McGuire said: "For some the stress and new surroundings that come with leaving to go to university can trigger mental health issues." "NUS is concerned about cuts to services that support students facing these challenges, particularly around poor referrals on to outside services, and whether those services themselves actually have adequate resources to help students." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Consumer body to study universities</title>
      <description>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition.</description>

      <body>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition. The move follows concerns of inadequate regulation and variable teaching quality at institutions in England. The OFT has called for information from students, universities, regulators, government bodies and employers. It said choice between universities should "play a positive role in underpinning their success in future". OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell acknowledged that universities in England "enjoy an enviable reputation across the world". The review will focus on undergraduate higher education, particularly on whether recent changes aimed at giving students in England more choice and driving competition, have been effective. It defines university as including any provider of higher education courses. The review will look at whether the regulatory system is contributing to effective competition or undermining it. Earlier this month, a report criticised university regulation in England as inadequate in an era of higher student fees. The Higher Education Commission said that before higher fees were introduced last year, universities depended on teaching grants which came with regulatory conditions attached - but as the value of teaching grants falls and student fees rise, the ability to regulate universities through funding is also reduced. The OFT says it is particularly interested to hear how universities compete for students, how they deliver value for money and how they decide which courses to offer and how to deliver them. It will ask whether information from universities is adequate to help prospective students decide where and what to study, whether universities meet students' expectations and what they can do if they need to complain. In May, a report by the consumer group Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) revealed big variations in teaching time, with students at some universities getting twice as much teaching as others doing the same subject elsewhere. It included a poll that found that almost one in three first-year students at UK universities felt their courses were not good value for money. Sonia Sodha, head of public services at Which?, said she hoped the OFT review would lead to an improvement in the quality of university courses. "Our comparisons with previous decades show that today's students are working for fewer hours, are set less work and are receiving less detailed feedback. "With increased tuition fees and a greater choice of universities and courses than ever before, it's essential that students can access better information about the academic experience on offer so they can see whether they are getting value for money." Toni Pearce, president of the National Union of Students, said: "It would be useful to have an external view of what is working well, and in the best interests of students, and what may need some reform. "We would be particularly interested to hear what the OFT finds on issues NUS has campaigned on over many years, such as student access to information, including full transparency on teaching arrangements, complaints procedures, and means of redress if and when things go wrong." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the review in the light of major changes to the sector. "It is still early days in terms of assessing how the changes are working, but universities have done a great deal already to increase the amount of available information on courses and to respond to feedback from students." </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <body>A school is likely to remain closed for the rest of the week after ceiling damage, probably caused by heavy rain. The Grade II-listed Albert Primary in Penarth closed after loose plaster was found on two ceilings. Vale of Glamorgan council said the damage, thought to be the result of a water leak, was spotted on Monday. About 385 children attend the school, with another 72 in the nursery. The council said the ceilings would have to be made safe before re-opening. Councillor Chris Elmore, cabinet member for children's services, said: "Our officers think the damage has been the result of a water leak, probably caused by the extremely heavy rain we had over the weekend. "The damaged ceilings are over two halls, which lead to the classrooms. "My priority is the safety of the children and staff, so unfortunately we have to close the school while we make the ceilings safe. "We apologise to parents for the inconvenience and I will make sure our officers do everything they can to have the school open again as soon as possible." Parents have been told the school will probably remain closed this week, while next week is the half-term holiday. It said there is "no issue" with asbestos in the ceilings. The Victorian-era building closed temporarily for repairs last year. In December 2012, the school was closed down for emergency repairs to pipe work which required the floors being lifted up. </body>

      <title>University demand 'to rise by 26%'</title>
      <description>Universities minister says demand for undergraduate places will grow by a quarter in two decades.</description>

      <body>The number of places at UK universities will have to grow by at least a quarter over the next 20 years, the universities minister has warned. David Willetts says in a paper for the Social Market Foundation that the number of places needs to grow from 368,000 to 460,000 to meet demand. Universities have seen a squeeze on places in recent years, with thousands of students failing to get on courses. The primary school place shortage could go on to hit undergraduates, he says. The paper from the universities minister is billed as his projection of the future of higher education in the UK. It seeks to update a report written 50 years ago when just 5% of young people went to university. The Robbins report called for and led to a bold expansion in university places. It rested on the guiding principle that higher education should be open to all able and qualified enough to go. Robbins considered what the demand was likely to be over the next 20 years - based on the number of suitably qualified young people, not economic forecasts of future jobs. The projections in Mr Willetts's pamphlet follow this model and suggests there will be a need for 92,000 more places for England-based students in UK universities in the next 20 years. He says the current demographic backdrop is very different to the 1960s, when the country was in the grip of a baby boom, because of the fall in the number of babies born in the 1990s. But he adds: "However, looking ahead to the 2020s, we can see the increase in the number of births since the turn of the century feeding through into more young people. Those pressures have already been felt in our nurseries and primary schools." He also argues that as educational standards in England improve over the coming years, there will be a greater supply of young people with the potential to go to university, thus increasing demand still further. And he goes on to highlight differences between the English higher education system and European ones, hinting at a more liberal approach. He also says: "The English system is quite unusual amongst advanced countries for having such selective systems of entry to university... Other countries allow virtually automatic progression to your local university if you have the requisite qualifications." Although the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has introduced more flexibility in the system, with universities being allowed to recruit unlimited numbers of brighter students (those gaining certain high grades), overall the numbers have remained fairly static since 2010. But it is expected numbers will begin to recover again this coming year when admissions quotas for individual universities are being relaxed. When the Robbins report was published in 1963 there were nearly 216,000 full-time students in higher education. Robbins projected this number would grow to 558,000 by 1980-81. Director of the Social Market Foundation Emran Mian said: "David Willetts provides a compelling case for expanding higher education. This is our best bet for equipping the UK economy with the skills it needs and improving social mobility." The report stops short of saying how such demand will be met. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the pamphlet was Mr Willetts's personal view but would not comment further. </body>

      <title>School gates smokers abuse principal</title>
      <description>A head teacher in south London is targeted for abuse after asking parents to stop smoking outside the school gates.</description>

      <body>A head teacher who asked parents to stop smoking outside the school gates has been targeted for abuse. Susan Papas, 53, who was brought in to turn around Selsdon Primary in Croydon in south London, accused some parents of "negativity and bad manners". It follows a petition set up calling for her removal from the job and comments posted on the school's blog. Mrs Papas said the abuse "has to stop" and added that she was seeking legal advice and had contacted the police. The problems started after Mrs Papas wrote on the school's blog: "Whilst I don't have any jurisdiction over the behaviour of parents on the street, I do have responsibility for the pupils' behaviour on their way to and from school. "In the spirit of this I would respectfully ask that adults refrain from smoking immediately outside the school as some may see this as setting a bad example." Mrs Papas, who splits her time between Selsdon and Heavers Farm primary schools, said some parents replied to her post with abusive messages and hatched plans to hold a "smoking picket" to block the pavement. She said: "I did put a very positive and gently polite message on the blog but it didn't go down very well with some parents." In a subsequent post, entitled Standing up to the Bullies, Mrs Papas said: "I have been using social media for some years in my capacity as a head teacher and have never experienced the level of negativity and bad manners displayed by a handful of parents on here. "I have also been told about the rude and offensive comments being levelled against me, and other staff, on social media. This has to stop." Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said Mrs Papas should "not give in to the minority of parents" opposing the policy. She said: "The less children are exposed to adult smoking the less likely they are to take up the habit themselves. "Requesting parents not to smoke in the area immediately outside the school grounds is therefore reasonable and good practice." Angela Harbutt, from the smokers' rights group Forest, said she had sympathy for the head teacher and that the abuse could not be condoned. But she added: "I think she probably should have left it to the parents; they are adults and they should be able to sort it out between them. "I think she has stepped into the middle. I think it has gone too far, this persecution of smokers." </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/69961000/jpg/_69961608_iphone624.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no-one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called in metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <body>A Cambridgeshire head teacher wrote to parents about teaching their children to play conkers, after realising 95% of them did not know how. John Cattermole, from Littleport Primary, said he had to carry out a risk assessment and check the game was safe for nut allergy sufferers first. Conkers is not banned in schools, but some have chosen not to allow the game citing health and safety concerns. Mr Cattermole said parents were "very supportive" and the children loved it. He said he was inspired to introduce the game after seeing children looking at conkers on the ground, but not knowing what to do with them. "We showed them how to play during assembly, which is when I realised about 95% of them had never had a game of conkers in their life," he said. In the letter to parents, Mr Cattermole wrote: "We believe [conkers] is a fun, healthy game to play. It is also good for hand/eye co-ordination and gets children talking about maths and numbers as they play. "Mr Rivett and I have been showing children how to play safely in assembly today. "We have been in touch with the Anaphylaxis Association, as we have children at school with nut allergies. They have said there is no need to worry about conkers being on a school site." Parents were asked to fill in a slip at the foot of the letter if they did not wish their children to play conkers. Mr Cattermole said the school had received "many, many supportive emails" after sending the letter and said not one of the 416 pupils' parents objected. "Educationally, playing conkers has got the children talking about numbers and counting in the playground - but really it's just fun," he said. </body>

      <description>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions</description>

      <body>Members of Scotland's largest teachers' union have rejected proposed changes to their working conditions. EIS members voted against the changes by 59% to 41% in a consultative ballot. The proposals included greater flexibility over working, and changes to the things teachers should and should not be responsible for. There were also some changes to the list of agreed duties of things which should or should not be done by teachers. The EIS expects the current pay offer for teachers to now be withdrawn. The proposed changes were negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) following the publication of the McCormac Report on teacher employment. Among the proposals were greater flexibility over working time. For example a teacher might spend two hours more with students one week but have two hours less the next to balance this out. EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has been consistent in stating that any proposals arising from discussion of the McCormac report would be subject to a ballot of our members. "We have now completed that process and the result is a clear rejection by Scotland's teachers of the suggested changes to working conditions. "As always, the EIS is listening to its members and will make teachers' views known to the management side at the forthcoming meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers". The union said the rejection of the proposed changes to working conditions is also likely to have an impact on the agreed 1% pay offer for teachers in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Local government body Cosla had indicated that the 1% pay offer could be withdrawn if teachers rejected the changes to working conditions. The current pay offer also included improvements to the payment for short term supply teachers, a move being funded by the Scottish government. Mr Flanagan added: "We will be seeking constructive dialogue with both Cosla and Scottish government on what happens next. "No one wishes to see disruption in our schools, particularly at such a crucial phase in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, so we will await discussion of the issues at the SNCT before deciding how to proceed. "The ballot result, however, is indicative of the mood of teachers who after a two year pay freeze, increased pension contributions and in the face of excessive workload have simply said, 'Enough is enough.'" Councillor Billy Hendry, Cosla's human resources spokesman, said: "Firstly I am disappointed with the outcome of the EIS ballot. Secondly I am very disappointed that our teaching workforce will now not have their back dated pay in their pay packets before Christmas. "The simple fact is that as employers we have put together the very best components of an offer in agreement with the unions and the Scottish government. "The offer is a package and is not open to any one of the three parties to cherry pick the bits that they like best and reject the rest. "This offer remains on the table and will do so during our meeting with the EIS tomorrow." Education Secretary Michael Russell said: "I am disappointed that EIS members have voted to reject the proposals. "Obviously the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT) will have to look at this matter as a matter of urgency when they meet tomorrow." </body>

      <description>Tory education minister Elizabeth Truss rejects calls by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for tighter controls on free schools in England.</description>

      <body>Conservative education minister Elizabeth Truss has rejected Liberal Democrat calls for tighter controls on free schools in England. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the schools should employ only qualified teachers and adhere to the national curriculum. He said this was so parents could be sure their children were receiving a high standard of education. Mrs Truss said it was a "shame" some Lib Dems did not back free schools. She said the "whole point" of the schools "is they have these freedoms... that's what's helping them outperform maintained schools". "You shouldn't kill off the goose that's laid the golden egg," she said. Mrs Truss noted that independent schools "operate well" without being made to hire qualified teachers and have done so "for hundreds of years". Mr Clegg has denied his comments represented a "great coalition crisis" ahead of a speech in which he will distance the Liberal Democrats from part of the government's policy on free schools. The deputy prime minister told Sky News they were part of a "grown-up" debate between the parties. Downing Street had expressed surprise at Mr Clegg's comments. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups, are state-funded but operate outside local authority control. They were established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove and since September 2011 more than 170 have opened across England. Currently free schools have discretion over what to teach, but in his speech to a school in north London on Thursday, Mr Clegg will ask: "What's the point of having a national curriculum if only a few schools have to teach it?" Last week, the head teacher of a free primary school in London, who was still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education, stood down following criticism from Labour councillors. There was also controversy when the al-Madinah free school in Derby was judged by the education watchdog Ofsted to be "inadequate". In his speech, Mr Clegg will say: "I'm proud of our work over the last three years to increase school autonomy, which, in government with the Conservatives, has been through the academies programme." But he will go on to question "aspects of schools policy currently affected by the priorities of the Conservative Party which I would not want to see continue". Mr Clegg will add: "Whilst I want to give schools the space to innovate, I also believe every parent needs reassurance that the school their child attends, whatever its title or structure, meets certain core standards of teaching and care. A parental guarantee, if you like." The deputy prime minister told Sky News he was a supporter of free schools, but his concern was about maintaining standards. A Downing Street spokesman said earlier that, as recently as last week, the Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind the coalition's free schools policy, which makes Nick Clegg's comments all the more surprising". Michael Gove's allies have accused Mr Clegg of "fundamentally misunderstanding" the nature of free schools. Lib Dem sources have told the BBC that Mr Clegg argued for his proposed changes in cabinet but they were blocked by the education secretary. But Mr Clegg said current education policy was "something for Mr Gove" to handle and that he did not interfere in the workings of his department. Under plans announced by Labour, parent groups and other organisations would be able to set up schools outside local council control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. On Sunday, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Michael Gove and David Cameron's divisive Free Schools programme is unravelling for all to see. "But Nick Clegg is locked-in to this failure too. It is his policies that have led to the mess we saw at the al-Madinah Free School earlier, the looming crisis in teacher recruitment and the 141% rise in unqualified teachers since 2010." A Department for Education spokesman argued that free schools were "raising standards and giving parents more choice". He said the government was not going to take away the freedom free schools have for teachers to "set their own curriculum, decide how they spend their money and employ who they think are the best people for the job". </body>

      <body>Organisers of a scheme to give short-term employment to hundreds of newly-qualified teachers in Northern Ireland have said they are pleased at the number who have been appointed. Almost 270 two-year posts have been created to help improve literacy and numeracy standards in deprived areas. While almost 200 posts have been allocated, about 70 remain unfilled. The scheme is open to young teachers who graduated within the last three years but do not have permanent jobs. In May, the Western Education and Library Board was given the task of matching schools with the graduates. Alison Smyth of the Western Board said they hoped to advertise again and appoint more teachers after the Halloween mid-term break. "We have been interviewing the young teachers, and it's great that we're in the position now to have so many of them employed," she said. Some head teachers have expressed concern that the graduate teachers are not all yet in place. Stephen McConkey of Hollybank Primary School in Monkstown said: "I appreciate it's a difficult and time-consuming exercise. However, any school would have liked to see these teachers on-site by the end of August or start of September." All post-primary, non-selective schools have been allocated at least one new teacher, and selected primary schools were targeted to give children extra help with reading, writing and mathematics. However, the two-year period paid for by the Department of Education will end in August 2015, even if the graduate teachers do not start work until weeks or months into the school year. One graduate who has been employed as part of the scheme said it would boost his chances of getting a permanent job. David Kearney, who was recruited by Hollybank Primary School, said: "Unfortunately the nature of supply work is that it's not guaranteed, and there were times you were waiting for a phone call. "This is not a long-term fix but it's great to give young teachers a chance to develop their skills. "It puts us in a better position to apply for permanent jobs in the future." </body>

      <title>Teachers' Oscar for Japanese lessons</title>
      <description>A teacher who has introduced Japanese lessons is among this year's winners of the national teachers' awards.</description>

      <body>A teacher who has brought Japanese to the West Country is one of the winners of this year's teachers' awards. The so-called "teachers' Oscar" for secondary teacher of the year has been won by Crispin Chambers of Tavistock College, a comprehensive in Devon. The languages teacher was praised for his inspirational lessons, high results and for building links with Japan. His local mayor says the town should erect a statue to him in recognition of his achievements as a teacher. There are 1,200 pupils studying Japanese at the secondary school, from Year 7 to A-level, which makes it one of the biggest Japanese departments in the country. The school has an annual exchange visit to Tokyo and the Japanese embassy has described Mr Chambers as a "trailblazer" for promoting the language. Mr Chambers says that when the idea of teaching Japanese was launched in the 1990s, no-one expected it to work. Languages such as Japanese and Chinese were seen as something more likely to be taught to the most able pupils in independent schools. He says that the challenge has been to make it accessible to all ability groups - and now there are about 50 to 60 people taking the subject at GCSE each year, with outstanding grades. As well sending students to study Japanese at university, Mr Chambers says that speaking Japanese is a huge advantage in the jobs market, in areas such as banking, medicine or law. There have been many warnings about the UK's poor level of language skills, but Mr Chambers says that it is possible to "capture the imagination" with languages and to show students there is a real value to learning a language. Mr Chambers's first experience of teaching was in Japan and he says he was captivated by the respect shown to teachers and that it was seen as a "pleasure to study". "Parents would thank you in the street for teaching their children," he says. The role of teaching in the UK also needs to be recognised for its importance, he says. "One teacher can be the dominant feature in someone's life," he says. There were 24,000 nominations for this year's Pearson Teaching Awards, which were launched in 1998 to celebrate the achievements of the teaching profession. This year's ceremony at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London saw 10 prizes being awarded. Among the famous names handing over prizes was Mo Farah, who has acknowledged the important role PE teacher Alan Watkinson played in developing his athletics career. The winners of the 2013 Pearson Teaching Awards are: The awards ceremony will be shown on BBC Two on Sunday, 27 October at 17:30 in Britain's Classroom Heroes </body>

      <title>Child psychologist provision warning</title>
      <description>A national steering group warns that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low.</description>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <description>How did ancient Greek music really sound?</description>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24566926</url>
      <date>1382013970</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542139_housing2.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Esytn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>Counter-terrorism saga Homeland has been renewed for another season by US cable channel Showtime, as has 1960s-set drama Masters of Sex. The fourth season of Homeland and the second of Masters of Sex will both comprise 12 episodes and air in 2014. The shows are aired on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday and Tuesday respectively. The most recent instalment of Homeland was watched by 1.97 million, while Tuesday's episode of Masters of Sex attracted 848,000 viewers. The overnight figures are down on the ratings achieved by the shows' debut episodes on 6 and 8 October respectively. Homeland, starring Claire Danes as troubled CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was watched by 3.31 million viewers when it returned to UK screens earlier this month. And the opening episode of Masters of Sex, which stars Britain's Michael Sheen as pioneering sex expert Dr William Masters, drew an audience of 1.43 million two days later. In the US, both shows are broadcast back-to-back on a Sunday night, with the most recent edition of the terrorism drama attracting 1.8 million viewers and Sheen's drama watched by 1.4 million. "Homeland continues to prove its strength for Showtime, and is one of television's most exciting, provocative and widely-discussed shows," David Nevins, president of entertainment at the network, said. "The critical and audience reaction to Masters of Sex since its great launch has been incredibly gratifying. It's a privilege to get to work with such talented and creative people as [Homeland creator] Alex Gansa and [Masters of Sex's] Michelle Ashford, as well as their tremendous casts. "They have each created truly original shows, with distinctive voices that are among the most admired series on television." </body>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police Service will be the subject of a BBC One documentary series that will go behind the scenes at Britain's largest police force. Channel controller Charlotte Moore said The Met would be the first "definitive" look at the "vital" organisation. Over six hour-long episodes, she said the public would see the police force "in a way never seen before". Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was "delighted" to work with the BBC "on such an important project". "I hope that over the coming months, we can reveal the true scale and complexity of the challenges faced by officers and staff across the service." According to the BBC, the show will "take an in-depth look at how the Metropolitan Police Service works" and "show the scale and complexity of policing London on a day-to-day basis". "We have been granted extraordinary, unprecedented access to film from top to bottom of the organisation," said Moore, who nurtured the series in her previous role as commissioning editor for documentaries. The BBC One announcement coincides with news from BBC Three about five new factual and current affairs series. These include Slum Survivors, a three-part series that tests young people's resourcefulness in the slums of Lagos, Mumbai and Jakarta, and The Human Tissue Team, a two-part look at tissue donation. </body>

      <description>Lawyers representing the entertainer Freddie Starr question the length of time a police investigation into alleged sexual offences is taking.</description>

      <body>Lawyers representing the entertainer Freddie Starr have questioned the length of time a police investigation into alleged sexual offences is taking. On Wednesday, Mr Starr was rebailed until 5 December. The entertainer was first arrested in November 2012. His lawyer said he was "surprised" his client remained under investigation - but the Met Police confirmed they had not received any official complaint. Police said the delay was the result of the "complex nature" of the inquiry. Mr Starr was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the investigation set up to look at abuse claims against the late entertainer, Jimmy Savile. The allegations against Mr Starr, 70, fall under the strand of the investigation known as Savile and others. Mr Starr has denied any wrongdoing throughout. In a statement, Mr Starr's lawyer Dean Dunham said: "Freddie was due to return to the police station today to answer bail and our belief was that this would have marked the end of this matter. "However, we have been informed that the police have instead rebailed him to 5 December. We are astonished at the amount of time this investigation is taking in relation to Freddie and indeed surprised, on the basis of what has been put to him, that he even remains under investigation." Mr Starr was re-arrested by Yewtree officers in April when further allegations against him - unconnected to Savile - emerged. A Met Police spokesman said: "We are doing all we can to conclude matters as soon as possible and it should be appreciated the delay is the result of the complex nature of these inquiries." Yewtree is an inquiry into allegations of historical sexual abuse linked to the entertainment industry. It was launched after it emerged the late BBC Radio One DJ and television presenter Savile had subjected hundreds of young people and children to sexual abuse over more than five decades. The operation has three strands. One concerns Savile's crimes exclusively, while a second strand relates to allegations against Savile and others. The third strand concentrates on accusations which emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding Savile, but which are unconnected to him. Earlier this week, former Radio One DJ Chris Denning, who was arrested under that third strand, was rebailed until January. And an 80-year-old man from south London was rebailed until December. Meanwhile, the fourth suspect still on police bail, former singer Gary Glitter, is awaiting a decision as to whether he will be charged after after a complete file of evidence was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service on 10 October. Starr, who lives in Warwickshire, has previously denied claims that he groped a girl of 14 while in a BBC dressing room with Savile. </body>

      <body>Animated snail-racing tale Turbo has beaten Tom Hanks's true-life hostage drama Captain Phillips to the top of this week's UK box office. The Dreamworks film earned £3.9m including previews, compared with the £3.4m of Hanks's Paul Greengrass-directed thriller. Action stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone's prison break film Escape Plan was third with £961,470. The top five was rounded off by Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith. This week's figures are a lift on the previous seven days when Prisoners topped the chart for a third consecutive week, in a weekend which saw no release make more than £1m. Turbo, which features the voices of Ryan Reynolds and rapper Snoop Dogg, flopped when it was released in the US earlier this year, earning $21m (£13m) over its first weekend. With a reported budget of $135m (£83.6m) it only made $82.6m (£51.2m) in North America during its run, although it has since earned more than $224m (£139m) worldwide. Hanks, meanwhile, has won rave reviews for his role in the film about a container ship seized by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009. The film opened this year's London Film Festival. Bollywood action film Boss, starring Akshay Kumar, opened at number nine despite opening in just 63 screens. Averaging £3,732 per cinema, it took significantly more than Escape Plan's average of £2,656 per location across 362 screens. Romantic drama Enough Said, starring Sopranos actor James Gandolfini in one of his final film roles opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, missed out on a top 10 place but earned a respectable £170,357 from its 79 screens. While a second bad week for Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, saw it fall out of the top 10 to 13 after taking £118,397. </body>

      <title>China sackings over ruined frescos</title>
      <description>Two officials in China are sacked after unauthorised restorers paint over ancient Buddhist temple frescos with cartoon-like figures from Taoist myths.</description>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <body>Three Romanian men have pleaded guilty to stealing seven paintings, including works by Picasso, Gauguin, Monet and Matisse, from a Dutch museum last year. Radu Dogaru, Alexandru Bitu and Eugen Darie told a Bucharest court they took the paintings from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam in October 2012. The suspects admitted they brought the paintings to Romania and had tried to sell them on the black market. The seven works have never been found and may have been burned. Thieves broke in through a rear emergency exit of the museum, grabbing the paintings off the wall and fleeing within minutes. The stolen works included two paintings by Monet, a 2002 piece by Lucien Freud and a self-portrait by the Dutch painter Meye de Haan. Speaking in court on Tuesday, Mr Dogaru said security had been "practically inexistent" and he had "entered practically just with a screwdriver". His lawyer went on to tell reporters his client said he had inside help. A spokeswoman for the museum declined to comment. Mr Dogaru told the court the paintings had been handed over to a Russian Ukrainian man and had not been burned in his mother's stove as had been suggested. Olga Dogaru, who is charged with handling stolen property, had told investigators she burned the paintings but later denied it. Her son also claimed at one point he had offered to return five of the paintings to Dutch authorities, but they had declined the offer and demanded all seven. Six Romanians have been put on trial in the case. One is still on the run and being tried in absentia. The next hearing in the case will be held on 19 November. </body>

      <title>Hall questioned over new allegations</title>
      <description>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall is rearrested by Lancashire Police over historical child sex offences.</description>

      <body>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall has been rearrested by Lancashire Police over child sex offences. The arrests relate to two females, who were aged between 12 and 15 at the time of the abuse, which was allegedly committed between 1974 and 1980. A force spokesman said the offences allegedly took place in Manchester and Derbyshire. Hall, 83, is serving a 30-month jail sentence for 14 counts of sexual abuse against girls. In June he admitted abusing the girls, who were aged from nine to 17, between 1967 and 1985. His original 15-month jail sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal in July. On Tuesday it was announced Hall had been stripped of the OBE he was awarded in December 2011. Hall, who had been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, is to serve half of his 30-month sentence, meaning he will be released in September 2014, the BBC understands. As a broadcaster, Hall was described as eccentric, erudite and egotistical - a distinctive personality who could balance light entertainment with sports and serious news. He was the face of BBC regional news in the North West before his national profile was raised presenting It's A Knockout on BBC TV, which he once described as "The Olympic Games with custard pies". In later years he was best known for his football match reports on BBC Radio Five Live. But Preston Crown Court heard he was an "opportunistic predator" who used his fame to befriend girls. </body>

      <body>World-renowned architect Frank Gehry is to design residential buildings as part of the £8bn redevelopment of London's Battersea Power Station. Gehry Partners will work with Foster and Partners on the 'High Street' phase of the development, a retail pedestrian street that will link the site to the proposed new Northern Line extension. Sir Norman Foster's company will design the residential buildings to the west. Gehry's firm will design the buildings to the east - his first in London. Together the companies will design 1,200 apartments, a 200-room hotel and 350,000 sq ft of retail and restaurant space. "Gehry Partners is honoured to have this wonderful opportunity to collaborate with our respected colleagues Foster and Partners on this seriously important project for the city of London," said Gehry, 84. "Our goal is to help create a neighbourhood and a place for people to live that respects the iconic Battersea Power Station while connecting it into the broader fabric of the city." Gehry is best known for such eye-catching edifices as the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris. Yet his only construction in London to date was the temporary summer pavilion he designed for the Serpentine Gallery in 2008. Lord Foster, 78, designed London's famous Gherkin tower, the new Wembley Stadium and the redeveloped Reichstag in Berlin. Grant Brooker of Foster and Partners said the company was "absolutely delighted to be chosen to be part of this inspiring regeneration project". Famed for its four brick chimneys, Battersea Power Station was decommissioned in 1983 and has been vacant for the last 30 years. It is internationally famous for featuring on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals and has been used as a location in numerous films. </body>

      <body>One of the world's leading art events, the Turner Prize exhibition, has opened to the general public in Northern Ireland. The exhibition is being held outside England for the first time. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington, in Londonderry. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. Four artists are in contention for the award. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. Director of Tate Britain, Penelope Curtis, said: "Derry was an obvious place to bring the Turner Prize with it being the City of Culture year. "We wanted the Turner Prize to be more diverse and Derry was the right place. "London gets lots of contemporary art but Derry gets less. "Bringing it to the barracks seemed quite a controversial decision at the start but Derry feels very different now after my first visit 20 years ago. "This is the most diverse Turner Prize ever put on and this is a real chance for being part of history." Journalists from across the world descended on Derry for a preview on Tuesday morning. Chief executive of the Culture Company, Shona McCarthy, said: "This is absolutely amazing for the city. "This is a world class gallery space at Ebrington Square. "It's exciting for our young people to have this in their city." The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. Derry-born artist Willie Doherty said: "We have reached the main point of the year in my eyes. "I'm not convinced that this space at Ebrington should be turned into an office space. "We need to keep this as an art gallery." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Extracts and Verses exhibition at the Chisenhale Gallery. She is of Ghanaian descent and is the first black woman to be in contention for the award. Glasgow-based David Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greetings cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Born in Lille in 1978, Laure Prouvost won the fourth Max Mara art prize for women in 2011 for her short films and installation work. Based in London, she is shortlisted for her new work Wantee, featured in Tate Britain's Schwitters in Britain exhibition, and her two-part Max Mara art prize installation. Born in 1976 and based in Berlin, Tino Sehgal has been shortlisted for his "pioneering" projects This Variation and These Associations. The latter, staged last year at Tate Modern in London, invited the public to interact with volunteers in a "live installation" staged in the gallery's expansive Turbine Hall. </body>

      <body>Robbie Williams is to perform duets with Lily Allen and Rufus Wainwright at a one-off live swing show next month. Muppets Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog will also appear at the London Palladium, singing songs from Williams's new album Swings Both Ways. He and Allen have recorded Dream a Little Dream, previously sung by Ella Fitzgerald and The Mamas and The Papas. The show on 8 November will be Allen's first live UK performance since taking a break from music to have children. The singer and mother of two stepped out of the limelight following her 2009 album It's Not Me, It's You, but in February this year performed at a Paris fashion show produced by former collaborator Mark Ronson. She is now gearing up for the release of her third album, which she promised Twitter followers in August would be "soon", and has also penned songs for the forthcoming Bridget Jones musical. Williams's latest record is his second swing-themed release after 2001's Swing When You're Winning - a play on the name of his previous studio album, Sing When You're Winning. Kelly Clarkson, Michael Buble and Olly Murs have also recorded tracks for the album, including I Wan'na Be Like You from The Jungle Book, featuring Murs. Williams's new single, Go Gentle, is released on 11 November, with the album following a week later. Swings Both Ways has also seen Williams reunite with long-term writing partner Guy Chambers for several new songs. The one-off gig is being filmed for broadcast on BBC One at a later date. A statement released by Williams's management quoted Miss Piggy as saying: "Moi is always thrilled to perform at the Palladium, no matter who I have to share the stage with. "But being up there with moi's dear friend Robbie Williams and Kermie will make this night even more spectacular." </body>

      <title>Queen visits National Theatre at 50</title>

      <body>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have visited the National Theatre, as the institution celebrates its 50th birthday. During the tour, the Queen met one of the puppet horses from the NT's acclaimed production of War Horse. The Queen has previously seen the show, based on Michael Morpurgo's novel, which tells the story of Joey, a horse who serves in World War I. NT director Sir Nicholas Hytner said it had been "a very special day". Tuesday is 50 years to the day since the first National Theatre production. Peter O'Toole played Hamlet on 22 October 1963 at the Old Vic theatre, the NT's original home, under the direction of its founder Sir Laurence Olivier. Among the cast in that first performance was the 23-year-old actor Michael Gambon. Speaking at a 50th anniversary talk at the National's Olivier Theatre on Tuesday night, Sir Michael recalled: "I never had to speak. I was just at the back with a spear." He added: "I used to walk out of the stage door at night at the Old Vic and put myself just behind Sir Laurence as he was going out to his car to seem as though I was one of his friends." Actress Sheila Reid, who appeared in Olivier's Othello in 1964, said that appearing stage with Sir Laurence "was a bit like playing tennis with somebody better than yourself". The NT moved to its current home on the South Bank in 1976. More than 800 productions have taken place over the last 50 years, including premieres of plays by Tom Stoppard, Peter Shaffer, Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett and David Hare. During their visit on Tuesday, the Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour by outgoing director Sir Nicholas Hytner. They heard a musical number from Guys and Dolls, the first musical to be staged at the National in 1982, and watched a rehearsal for the forthcoming production Emil And The Detectives, based on the story of a boy living in 1920s Berlin. Dame Joan Plowright, who was married to Sir Laurence Olivier when he led the National Theatre, also met the Queen. The actress said: "It's a very special day, it's quite hard not to feel quite emotional about it. "I remember what the day was like when it was about to open - the nerves and apprehension. It's a huge task to take on the first season of a new national theatre." Dame Joan added: "It's had quite a history - I would say more triumphs than disasters." The Queen also unveiled a plaque to mark her visit and the 50th anniversary. Tuesday's encounter with War Horse puppet Joey wasn't the first time the Queen had met the mechanical star of the show, which is in the West End and abroad. During the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant last summer, the Queen appeared to enjoy watching the animal running across the roof of the National Theatre, which first staged the play, as the royal barge sailed past. As her tour of the theatre company ended, she told the puppet horse: "It's lovely to see you again." Puppeteer Gareth Aled said after meeting the Queen: "She's familiar with horses and with Joey, it's a very lovely privilege to have that meeting, she knows horses probably better than we do." Joey walked up to the Queen and followed her as she walked to her waiting state limousine before rearing up on his hind legs as the car departed. Mr Aled added: "It's all about striving for realistic horse movement, every horse movement should feel life-like." The National Theatre's 50th year is being marked by a series of events, including a star-studded gala on 2 November which will be shown on BBC Two. Famous alumni including Dame Judi Dench, Simon Russell Beale, Sir Michael Gambon, Sir Derek Jacobi and Dame Maggie Smith will perform speeches from roles they have played there. Dame Maggie will reprise her role as Mrs Sullen in George Farquhar's comedy The Beaux' Stratagem, Russell Beale will return to Hamlet, while Dame Judi, who appeared in Antony and Cleopatra in 1987, will re-enact the elegy to Antony. "I'm frightened, but I'm thrilled to be part of it," Dame Judi told the BBC. Sir Nicholas Hytner even hinted to the Evening Standard that blockbuster show The History Boys, which launched the career of James Corden, could even make a return for the gala. Dame Judi said the institution was still "essential" as it celebrated its golden anniversary. "The place is absolutely buzzing with people," she told BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba. "There are exhibitions, there is music, there are three theatres going. It's a very alive place. "We need that to stimulate our emotions. We need to see things that make us cry, laugh, think about something, be excited, be saddened, be angry. "We were so long without a National Theatre," she added, "and we've been very, very lucky." Sir Nicholas Hytner leaves the National Theatre in 2015, when he will be replaced by Rufus Norris, whose credits include The Amen Corner and Dr Dee: An English Opera. The role is widely regarded as the biggest job in British theatre. Norris, who was appointed last week, called it "a great honour". </body>

      <description>The trial of Bolshoi ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko over an acid attack on the company's artistic director opens and is adjourned.</description>

      <body>The trial of Bolshoi ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko over an acid attack on the company's artistic director has opened and been adjourned. Sulphuric acid was thrown at Sergei Filin outside his Moscow flat in January, badly damaging his eyesight. Mr Dmitrichenko denies arranging the attack. If convicted, he could face 12 years in jail. Two other men are being tried with him over the attack. The attack revealed bitter infighting and rivalries inside the Bolshoi. The other two on trial are Yuri Zarutsky, who is accused of throwing the acid, and Andrei Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car. The venue for the trial - a tiny courtroom in Moscow - was packed with journalists as the defendants were led into a caged dock. Before proceedings began, Mr Dmitrichenko, 29, repeated that he was innocent of the charges. "I do not admit that I am guilty," he told journalists. Shortly after the trial got under way, the judge adjourned proceedings for a week because a lawyer for Mr Zarutsky was not present. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says it was one of the most chaotic court hearings he has attended in Russia. After initially admitting to masterminding the attack, Mr Dmitrichenko later said he had discussed an assault on Mr Filin but not the use of acid. Following a pre-trial hearing, Mr Dmitrichenko's lawyer alleged that the defendant had been beaten by masked police - a claim that the Russian interior ministry has denied. The day before the trial, lawyer Sergei Kadyrov said: "Dmitrichenko does not consider himself guilty of causing grave harm to Filin's health." "I hope the court will be able to distance itself from the public resonance of this case and deliver a well-grounded and just verdict." Mr Filin has had more than 20 operations to try to save his eyesight. Following treatment in Germany, he returned to Moscow for the inauguration of the Bolshoi's season last month, wearing dark glasses. At one point, more than 300 members of the Bolshoi Ballet wrote to President Vladimir Putin, saying that the idea that Mr Dmitrichenko was behind the crime was "absurd". Mr Dmitrichenko has been in custody since March. </body>

      <body>One of the world's most prestigious art events - the Turner Prize exhibition - will open in Northern Ireland later. It will be held at the old barracks in Ebrington, Derry, as part of the city's year as the UK City of Culture. Now in its 29th year, this is the first time the Turner Prize has been held outside England. Four artists are in contention for the award. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, French installation artist Laure Prouvost, Britain's David Shrigley and the British-German performance artist Tino Sehgal are on this year's shortlist. Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Previous winners include Damien Hirst, Antony Gormley and last year's recipient, the video artist Elizabeth Price. The Derry event is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Extracts and Verses exhibition at the Chisenhale Gallery. She is of Ghanaian descent and is the first black woman to be in contention for the award. Born in 1977, she attended Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Falmouth College of Arts and the Royal Academy Schools. According to the prize's organisers, her "intriguing" paintings "appear traditional but are in fact much more innovative". Glasgow-based David Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greetings cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. His words have been used in recordings by David Byrne and Franz Ferdinand and he directed the video for Blur's 2009 track Good Song. Born in Macclesfield in 1968, Shrigley is shortlisted for his solo exhibition Brain Activity, at London's Hayward Gallery. The exhibition, said the Turner Prize organisers, was a "comprehensive overview" that revealed "his black humour, macabre intelligence and infinite jest". Born in Lille in 1978, Laure Prouvost won the fourth Max Mara art prize for women in 2011 for her short films and installation work. Based in London, she is shortlisted for her new work Wantee, featured in Tate Britain's Schwitters in Britain exhibition, and her two-part Max Mara art prize installation. Her "unique" approach to film-making, said organisers, "employs strong story-telling, quick cuts, montage and deliberate misuse of language to create surprising and unpredictable work". Born in 1976 and based in Berlin, Tino Sehgal has been shortlisted for his "pioneering" projects This Variation and These Associations. The latter, staged last year at Tate Modern in London, invited the public to interact with volunteers in a "live installation" staged in the gallery's expansive Turbine Hall. "Both structured and improvised, Seghal's intimate works consist purely of live encounters between people and demonstrate a keen sensitivity to their institutional context," said organisers. "Through participatory means, they test the limits of artistic material and audience perception in a new and significant way." This year's jury is chaired by Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis and includes the curator Annie Fletcher and the writer and lecturer Declan Long. Bookmakers Ladbroke have made Shrigley 2/1 favourite to win the prize, ahead of Prouvost, Sehgal and Yiadom-Boakye, a 7/2 outsider. </body>

      <body>A shot of mist swirling over a Cumbrian lake has taken the top prize in a national photography award. The image, Crummock Water Mists and Reflections, has seen Derbyshire's Tony Bennett named as the Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year. Mr Bennett said the photograph captured "a moment in time, never to be repeated but always remembered". The picture and the winners of 15 other categories will be on show at London's National Theatre from 7 December. Other photographs on display will be Christopher Page's shot of autumn leaves in Surrey, which saw him named the Young Photographer of the Year, and David Lyon's Ferry leaving Newhaven harbour in storm, which won the Your View category. Mr Bennett said his photograph had been difficult to take as "every second the scene was changing, creating a hundred memorable images". "The still night mist began rolling and tumbling, as if in protest, as the heat of the sun vaporized and dispersed it forever," he said. "Within a minute, it was over - a moment in time, never to be repeated but always remembered." Take a View founder Charlie Waite said Mr Bennett's image represented the talents of UK photographers and their ability to capture the country's natural beauty. "Tony's magical image evokes the spirit of the Lakes - a personal view that speaks to many," he said. </body>

      <body>Tim Burton is in talks to direct Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice 2, according to Hollywood trade magazines. Burton directed the first cult hit movie, which was released in 1988 and starred Keaton as a fast-talking, devious ghost from the underworld. The Frankenweenie director is currently working on the film Big Eyes, before going on to direct Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The original Beetlejuice spawned an animated TV series produced by Burton. The film also starred Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Burton has been nominated twice for Oscars in the animated feature category - for Corpse Bride in 2006, and last year for Frankenweenie. Beetlejuice won an Academy Award for best make-up in 1989. </body>

      <body>British film-maker Peter Greenaway is to receive the Stockholm Film Festival's prestigious visionary award. The festival's jury praised The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover director for "challenging the spectator like a true modern visionary". The jury said Greenaway had "created a new cinematic language by questioning traditional notions of artistic expression". Previous winners include Gus Van Sant and Wes Anderson. Greenaway has directed more than 50 films, including The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning By Numbers and The Pillow Book. The director and trained artist will receive his prize - a bronze horse statuette - in Stockholm on 8 November, where he will also take part in a meet-the-audience session. He is currently professor of film studies at the European Graduate School in Switzerland and has curated art exhibitions worldwide. Earlier this year, Greenaway announced he was returning to the UK to film an adaptation of Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. "There is a surge of film-making activity in England and the studios seem to be more available," he told Screen Daily. Greenaway has not made a film in Britain since The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, starring Dame Helen Mirren, in 1989. The film-maker famously declared that "cinema is dead" in 2002. The Stockholm Film Festival runs from 6 to the 14 November. Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is the opening film. </body>

      <title>Netflix reports surge in profits</title>
      <description>TV and film streaming service Netflix sees global subscriber numbers surge past 40 million and a jump in profits thanks in part to some hit original shows.</description>

      <body>TV and film streaming service Netflix has seen global subscriber numbers surge past 40 million and profits jump, thanks in part to its popular original programmes. The firm behind prison drama Orange is the New Black said its net profit rose to $32m (£19.8m) in the three months to the end of September. In the same period a year earlier, it made a profit of £7m. Shares in the firm rose 10% in after-hours trading on Monday. Netflix executives said its investment in original programmes had helped to drive profit. Its other self-produced shows included political drama House Of Cards. It now plans to double its investment in original content, but said it would still account for less than 10% of the overall output it offers. "Over the next few years we aspire to support creation of some of the most compelling and remarkable content ever produced," Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings and chief financial officer David Wells said in a letter to investors. The California-based company is considering further television shows, as well as starting to make its own movies. "We are actively looking right now at a few documentary projects. We'd like to do more of that in the movie space," said chief content officer Ted Sarandos. Netflix subscribers watched a total of about five billion hours of films and television shows in the last quarter, according to Mr Hastings. Netflix's shares rose to $388.50 in after-hours trading on Monday, compared with their close of $354.99 on the Nasdaq index. Standard and Poor's equity analyst Tuna Amobi said Netflix had "turned an important corner for potentially sustained subscriber growth". He added: "There is not a whole lot not to like. There is a whole lot of momentum behind the story." </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>Pop star Rihanna was asked to leave a famous Abu Dhabi mosque complex after posing outside the building for an unauthorised photo shoot. The singer tweeted pictures of herself in a black jumpsuit and headscarf on photo-sharing site Instagram. A statement from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre, said she was asked to leave after "inappropriate pictures" were taken. The photos "did not comply with terms and conditions" of organised visits. Rihanna performed live in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The mosque said Rihanna, 25, first arrived "at an entrance that was not designated for visitors". "She was confronted by the mosque officials and directed to the appropriate entrance to the mosque, to carry out a visit under the normal conditions." She was asked to leave after striking a series of poses for the photo shoot. The statement claimed Rihanna turned up at the mosque "without any previous co-ordination with the administration". Several of the photos could be construed as suggestive, with one showing the pop star lying on her back in the mosque's courtyard. The mosque is a major tourist attraction which welcomes non-Muslims - it had more than three million visitors last year. Rihanna's publicity team has yet to make a comment. </body>

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <title>BBC 'would air' Comic Relief claims</title>
      <description>BBC Director General Tony Hall tells a parliamentary select committee that a Panorama programme containing claims against Comic Relief, will be broadcast if the allegations are proved to be true.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24621450</url>

      <body>BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the BBC will broadcast a Panorama programme featuring allegations about Comic Relief, if they are true. Newspaper reports have claimed the investigation into several charities, is in danger of being "shelved". But Lord Hall told a parliamentary select committee he "very much" hoped it would be transmitted. He added: "I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." It was reported by The Mirror newspaper that the Panorama programme is looking into claims the charity has invested £150 million of its funds for up to eight years before passing money on to the causes for which it had been raised. There are also allegations that some of the money went to a fund which invested in tobacco firms and an arms company. Lord Hall is appearing before a Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee alongside Chairman of the BBC Trust, Lord Patten, to discuss the BBC's annual report. He was asked by Mr Philip Davies MP if the Panorama programme would be broadcast. "The thing I learned when I was last in the BBC… was that when you have a programme which is controversial, and right to be controversial, making big claims, and right to be making big claims, you shouldn't set a transmission date," said Lord Hall. He said programme makers "should set aside time" to talk to lawyers and check claims, adding "that's exactly what's happening with this programme." Lord Hall said he had discussed the programme directly with director of news, James Harding, adding "there's no string of BBC executives" making decisions about the programme. Comic Relief has called the claims "inaccurate" and "misleading". When pressed on whether the six-month investigation into charities' pay and investments would be broadcast, Lord Hall said: "I don't know yet. I very much hope this programme will be transmitted but I don't know yet what the substance of the allegations are, and whether they are right or wrong. "My aim is to get programmes on the air [and] I believe strongly in the BBC's ability to carry out investigative journalism." Lord Hall was asked by Ben Bradshaw MP if there were parallels with Newsnight's dropped Jimmy Savile investigation, and whether that was why staff had leaked the story to the press. "I don't know about the parallels," said Lord Hall. "This is a much clearer story which, if established, I think is a proper story to tell." "I've done a lot of programmes like this [in my previous career at the BBC]. We did all sorts of different stories. But what we needed from the journalists was to work through the implications of what they were saying and if they do that, they will have my complete support." Lord Hall added: "We are moving as quickly as we can." Both Lord Hall and Patten are appearing in front of the committee to discuss the findings of this year's BBC annual report, published in July this year. It revealed the BBC spent around £5m on three inquiries set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. The Pollard Review, which looked into Newsnight's dropped investigation into the presenter, cost £2.8m. The report also found public trust in the BBC had now almost recovered to previous levels, following the Savile and Newsnight crises. At the select committee hearing on Tuesday, Lord Hall was also questioned on the issue of bullying and harassment among staff at the BBC. The Respect at Work Review by Dinah Rose QC was published in May and suggested there was "a strong undercurrent of fear" at the BBC when addressing these issues. Lord Hall said the BBC had been working "very hard" on implementing the report's recommendations. "We are, this week, opening our first ever bullying and harassment support line to allow people to say if they think they are being bullied and harassed, and we are trying to deliver results on all the cases as quick as we can," he said. He confirmed a number of disciplinary hearings had been carried out and that in one case, the subject of the complaint was no longer working at the BBC. Lord Hall also stated that his new £150,000 cap on severance pay was "very real" and that it would be enforced on all of the 300 staff it applied to, despite around 20 senior managers disagreeing with the cap. When questioned on the issue of cuts to local radio by Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Hall agreed there was "a danger" of news being recycled as a result. However he added that he wanted to "be ambitious, with limited resources" with his plans for the BBC's 39 local stations. "There's a lot to do in partnership with local newspapers and other local organisations," he said, adding he wanted to do more to "reflect the quality of the arts, culture and other things going on in communities". </body>

      <description>Lou Scheimer, who founded the Filmation animation studio which produced He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, dies aged 84.</description>

      <body>Lou Scheimer, the founder of the Filmation animation studio which produced He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, has died aged 84. Pittsburgh native Scheimer died on Thursday, two days before his 85th birthday, his wife Mary Ann said. Alongside his success with He-Man and The Archie Show, he won a daytime Emmy award for the 1974-75 season of the Star Trek animated series. He leaves his wife, his daughter, Erika and his son, Lane. Born in Pennsylvania in 1928, he graduated from Carnegie Tech University in Pittsburgh, with a bachelors degree in Fine Arts in 1952. He, along with partners Hal Sutherland and Norm Prescott, founded Filmation in 1962 with a $5,000 loan from his mother-in-law, so-named because: "We were working on film, but doing animation". Filmation's first major project was an animated sequel to The Wizard of Oz, followed in 1966 by an animated Superman series and then The Archie Show - based on the successful US comic books. Filmation's animated Star Trek series was widely praised and featured the voices of the show's original cast, including William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. In 1983, the company was approached by toy makers Mattel to produce a series based on their line of action figures He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. The cartoon ran for two seasons, each with 65 episodes. Filmation's animation style sacrificed a degree of quality for the sake of quantity. Cartoons often appeared slightly jerky because of the cost-cutting use of fewer than the regular 24 frames a second. However, He-Man was one of the most popular children's programmes of the 80s and was ranked by IGN magazine, in 2009, as the 58th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list. It has since gone on to become a cult favourite on home media. Scheimer, also provided the voice of the magical character Orko and voiced several other animated characters through the years. The franchise was adapted for the big screen, starring Dolph Lundgren as the titular muscle-bound "most powerful man in the universe". With comedian Bill Cosby, Scheimer created Fat Albert, considered to be ground-breaking as the one of the first animated series centring on African American characters. Filmation closed in 1989 and Scheimer formed a new company called Lou Scheimer Productions. He retired several years ago. His cause of death has not been revealed but he was understood to have been suffering from Parkinson's Disease. DreamWorks purchased the Filmation library last year. </body>

      <description>'Sex Pistols records and rarities took over my house - before I sold them all'</description>

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid £100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had £2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Grangemouth chemical plant to close</title>
      <description>The operator of the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland says the site's petrochemical plant is to close.</description>

      <body>The petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close with the loss of about 800 jobs, owner Ineos has announced. The news was broken to the workforce at the plant and its associated oil refinery at a meeting on Wednesday. Ineos said a decision on whether to restart the refinery would be taken once the "threat of strike action" had been removed. Scotland's first minister said the closure "matches our worst fears". The Unite union described the closure as "catastrophic". About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the plant, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Workers leaving the staff meeting, which lasted about 20 minutes, told the BBC the decision to close the plant was "shocking". One member of staff claimed that Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean had been "smiling" when he made the announcement. Mr Maclean has since denied the allegation. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: "I feel sick. It's gone. There's no livelihoods left and we don't even know if we're going to get redundancy out of it. I hope they're happy with themselves." The worker, who appeared close to tears at points, said he could only listen to about 10 minutes of the meeting, before he felt he had to leave. He went on: "There are folk in there have a husband and wife work here. That's it. Folk will be lucky if they have a house at Christmas." Ineos said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. In a statement released after the staff meeting, Ineos said: "The company made it clear that rejection of change would result in closure. Regrettably, the union advised union members to reject any form of change. "The outcome of the employee vote on the company's survival plan was a 50/50 split. "Within this, almost all of the administrative staff voted for the company's plan but a large majority of shop floor employees voted to reject it. "The shareholders met yesterday to consider the future of the business following the result of the employee vote. "Sadly, the shareholders reached the conclusion that they could not see a future for Grangemouth without change and therefore could no longer continue to fund the business." Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the announcement "has confirmed our fears that this was the intention of Ineos all along". He added: "Discussions have taken place with the company this morning and will continue over the course of the day. We have made further proposals in a last-ditch effort to stave off these catastrophic job losses which we believe are tantamount to economic and industrial vandalism. "Make no mistake, one man is holding this workforce and this country to ransom and that man is Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe. The ball is now in the court of Jim Ratcliffe and the respective governments in Edinburgh and Westminster and we await their responses." Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the closure of the petrochemical plant was the "outcome that matches our worst fears". Mr Salmond added: "I will be speaking again to management and unions today to try and seek any further resolution we can. I will also convene an emergency cabinet meeting with relevant ministers later today to discuss the on-going situation. "In preparing for this extremely difficult position we have been pursuing the contingency of potential buyers - we will now be actively exploring this as the main option as a matter of urgency. "The Scottish government strongly believes the site has a positive future and we will continue to work with the UK government and all other parties concerned to find a solution that supports the workers affected and the wider Scottish economy." Ministers - including the Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and the Energy Secretary Ed Davey - were to meet in London to decide on a response to the decision. Mr Davey said he was "saddened" to hear of the closure, particularly because of the impact it will have on the workforce and local community. He added: "Ineos have informed us that the refinery will stay open and the management wish to restart full operations as soon as possible. We stand ready to help with discussions between the management and the union to ensure this can happen." Mr Davey said fuel supplies continued to be delivered as usual and there was no current risk of disruption to supplies. He added: "I continue to work very closely with the Scottish government, and other colleagues across government to share information with them." However, Downing Street has indicated there will be no bailout for Grangemouth, and that it was up to the company and the trade unions to resolve the dispute. Workers at the site had been given until 18:00 on Monday to agree to the changes, which included a pay freeze and downgrading of pensions. Unite said half of the 1,370-strong workforce had rejected the proposed changes to contracts. The company has said the Grangemouth site, which has been shut down for a week because of the dispute, is losing £10m a month. The petrochemical plant is said to be losing £50m a year. Ineos had said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth, but only if workers agree to the new terms and conditions. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for £112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." Downing Street said that Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average £1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <body>The christening of Prince George has taken place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in London. The prince, third in line to the throne, was baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The christening was private, with only senior royals, four members of the Middleton family, the seven godparents and their spouses among the 22 guests. Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was born in London on 22 July. The duchess carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony, and the guests then left for tea hosted by the Prince of Wales at Clarence House. The godparents, announced earlier, are Oliver Baker, Emilia Jardine-Paterson, Earl Grosvenor, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, Julia Samuel, William van Cutsem and Zara Tindall. Mrs Tindall, wife of former England rugby player Mike Tindall, is Prince William's cousin, while the other six godparents are all friends of the royal couple. Prince George was baptised in a replica of the lace and satin christening gown made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1841. The duke and duchess chose two hymns, two lessons and two anthems for the christening. The hymns were Breathe on Me, Breath of God and Be Thou My Vision. Lessons from St Luke and St John were read by Pippa Middleton and Prince Harry, and the anthems were Blessed Jesu! Here we Stand and the Lord Bless You and Keep You. The anthems were sung by the Choir of Her Majesty's Chapel Royal, which performed at the royal couple's wedding. After the ceremony, celebrity photographer Jason Bell was expected to take a picture of the Queen and princes Charles, William and George together. This will echo a 1894 picture from the christening of the future Edward VIII, showing him with his father, grandfather and great-grandmother - George V, Edward VII and Queen Victoria. The picture is expected to be released on Thursday morning. </body>

      <body>A couple who trafficked a 10-year-old girl to the UK who was repeatedly raped and kept as a servant for nearly a decade have been jailed. Ilyas and Tallat Ashar brought the girl, who is deaf, from Pakistan and kept her at their home in Eccles, Salford, where she slept in the cellar. Ilyas Ashar, 84, who was found guilty of 13 counts of rape, was jailed for 13 years at Manchester Crown Court. Tallat Ashar, 68, convicted of benefit fraud and trafficking, got five years. Police said the pair claimed thousands of pounds of benefits in the girl's name, while she was made to clean and cook at several houses belonging to the family. The girl, now in her 20s, was found in the "sparse, cold and damp" cellar in 2009 by trading standards staff investigating allegations of illegal activity. Ilyas Ashar was also found guilty of benefit fraud and trafficking. Judge Peter Lakin, sentencing, said the couple had not shown any remorse. He said: "You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. "You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. You exploited her physically, mentally and economically. "There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity - you two took that away from her, you consigned her to a life of misery and degradation." He added: "You are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people." The victim was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family and also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. The court heard a proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. The couple's daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was given a 12-month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work after she was also found guilty of benefit fraud. The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned, the court heard. Details of the victim's ordeal only emerged after she was taught sign language, enabling her to be interviewed by police. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, said an appropriate name would be "Miss Courageous" after she spent 34 days in total being cross-examined. He said: "She is a remarkable young woman, a young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court." The passport used to allow the girl into the UK claimed she was 20, and it was a matter of "mystery and concern" how immigration officials at Heathrow did not spot the difference in age, he said. Those involved in her development since her discovery have described her progress like "a butterfly coming out of a chrysalis". </body>

      <title>British links to al-Shabab revealed</title>
      <description>A list of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to Somali militants al-Shabab - and related organisations - is compiled by the BBC.</description>

      <body>The names of almost 50 people from Britain who have links to al-Shabab - and related organisations - have been established by the BBC. Most of those on the list travelled to Somalia to fight or attempted to do so. Somali-based militants al-Shabab carried out the deadly attack on the Westgate mall in neighbouring Kenya. Lawyers for the family of one British recruit known to have died in Somalia are investigating whether he was killed in a raid involving western military. Al-Shabab is fighting to impose a brutal version of Islamic law on the country and the group is linked to al-Qaeda. The 47 names compiled by the BBC are based on a combination of sources, including public records from courts in the UK and abroad, and further first-hand research and accounts. It is not a complete list of people from the UK who are suspected of having gone to fight in the region. The research found that security chiefs believe at least 32 of the identifiable individuals went to fight. A further seven were named in British court cases as having attempted to enter Somalia, but their plans were discovered and disrupted. Others have been accused or convicted of raising money for al-Shabab, or facilitating the travel of others. Seven people on the list returned to the UK - but the fate of most of the others is completely unknown. Four of the men on the list are known to be dead, including men who featured on a video released by the group a week ago. The video included a message from a young man named as "Talha", who asked Muslims in Tower Hamlets - a borough in east London - to join the jihad in Somalia. Talha, whose real name was Taufail Ahmed, died in Somalia in November 2012. The Foreign Office said it had confirmed the death to his family, who are of Bangladeshi origin. He grew up in Stepney Green in east London. The BBC has tracked down people who knew him at school. They say he fell into a life of gang crime before leaving that world behind in favour of an extreme interpretation of Islam, before disappearing from the UK. "For British Muslims he's doing a disservice," said one former schoolmate. "For Muslims around the world, he is doing a disservice." In the al-Shabab video, the narrator says that "Talha" died after an attack involving American and British forces. The government has not commented on that claim but his family has asked the legal charity Reprieve to investigate. "The family were notified by British police officers. The FCO [Foreign Office] have knowledge of the incident and have told us that Taufail Ahmed received a Muslim burial," said Kat Craig from Reprieve. "We have reason to believe that there are Somali eyewitnesses who identified those involved as British personnel and for those reasons we believe that further inquiries need to be made and that the family has quite legitimate questions that need to be answered." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The badger cull in Gloucestershire is to be extended for eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Mark Jones, Gloucestershire resident and executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police are appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Commitee. The meeting took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where Mr Mitchell was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked" during the meeting. The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. The officers have since said they regret giving the statement, but Mr Mitchell's allies have dubbed this a "regretful non-apology" and called for root-and-branch changes to increase police accountability. Asked whether he believed the apology should be the end of the matter, former policing minister Nick Herbert said: "No, I don't think it is enough." The Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The wording of the IPCC report, let's just remind ourselves, was incredibly strong. "They suggest that the police officers gave a false account, that there was a deliberate attempt to discredit Andrew Mitchell, that their motives seem plain: they were pursuing a political agenda. "Now when the independent body says this, it is surely right that action is taken and it is very unsatisfactory that we have a situation where the leadership of the police force appears to disagree and take no action in spite of the view of the independent body that was set up to deal with complaints." Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for £3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <title>Marine 'executed Afghan prisoner'</title>
      <description>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial of three Royal Marines charged with murder has heard.</description>

      <body>An injured Afghan prisoner was "executed" by a British commando, a court martial has heard. Three Royal Marines, who cannot be named, are charged with murdering the unknown man while on duty in 2011. One of the men, known as Marine A, is accused of shooting the prisoner in the chest at close range. A helmet-mounted camera inadvertently filmed the incident and the footage was shown to the court. The three deny the charges against them. Charges against two further marines - D and E - were dropped in February but the anonymity order granted last year remains in place. Last November, Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett said the defendants would be at "real and immediate risk" from "organised terrorist activity and lone wolves", if their names were made public. Speaking to the board at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, prosecutor David Perry said the murder took place on 15 September 2011 when the three defendants were on active service. "The prosecution case is that Marine A used a pistol and deliberately shot and killed the unknown man. "It was not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. The prosecution case is that it amounted to an execution, a field execution," he said. Even though Marine A used the pistol, Marines B and C "encouraged and assisted Marine A in carrying out the killing," he added. Mr Perry said the incident had occurred after a patrol base in Helmand Province had come under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire fired from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, which he described as a legitimate operation. The marines had come across the injured man in a field, the court heard. Marine A wanted to move him from an area where an air balloon, known as a PGSS, was in use for observation. "He knew full well what he was going to do," Mr Perry said. The court heard that after Marine A shot the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol he swore at him and said: "There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." The prosecutor said Marine A then said to the other marines: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention." Mr Perry accused the three defendants of using the Afghan man's injuries as a "cloak" to conceal their own actions, reporting he had died from wounds inflicted by the helicopter. Five recordings caught on a camera mounted on the helmet of Marine B were shown to the panel. In one conversation between Marine A and C about shooting the man one serviceman is overheard asking "Anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?" before another replies loudly "Nope." In another Marine C was heard asking A if he should shoot the man in the head, which was refused with more offensive language as "obvious". A journal which had been written by Marine C also gave an insight into what happened during the alleged murder, the court heard. The men - who were hidden from view of the public gallery of the courtroom by the use of a screen - were arrested by Royal Military Police last October after civilian police found suspicious footage on a serviceman's laptop in the UK. They are accused of murdering the Afghan national contrary to Section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. The court martial is expected to see further video evidence either later on Wednesday or on Thursday. One clip is said to show a body being moved from an open field to a mound, while another allegedly shows the shooting of the injured man by Marine A. The trial could last up to three weeks. The marines have been released on bail. </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Esytn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <title>Hall questioned over new allegations</title>
      <description>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall is rearrested by Lancashire Police over historical child sex offences.</description>

      <body>Jailed former BBC presenter Stuart Hall has been rearrested by Lancashire Police over child sex offences. The arrests relate to two females, who were aged between 12 and 15 at the time of the abuse, which was allegedly committed between 1974 and 1980. A force spokesman said the offences allegedly took place in Manchester and Derbyshire. Hall, 83, is serving a 30-month jail sentence for 14 counts of sexual abuse against girls. In June he admitted abusing the girls, who were aged from nine to 17, between 1967 and 1985. His original 15-month jail sentence was doubled by the Court of Appeal in July. On Tuesday it was announced Hall had been stripped of the OBE he was awarded in December 2011. Hall, who had been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, is to serve half of his 30-month sentence, meaning he will be released in September 2014, the BBC understands. As a broadcaster, Hall was described as eccentric, erudite and egotistical - a distinctive personality who could balance light entertainment with sports and serious news. He was the face of BBC regional news in the North West before his national profile was raised presenting It's A Knockout on BBC TV, which he once described as "The Olympic Games with custard pies". In later years he was best known for his football match reports on BBC Radio Five Live. But Preston Crown Court heard he was an "opportunistic predator" who used his fame to befriend girls. </body>

      <body>A number of people have been arrested in Scotland under the Terrorism Act during an operation focused on dissident Irish Republicans. Police Scotland said they were arrested at several locations under section 41 of the Act "on suspicion of committing various offences". It is believed that those who were arrested are being held at Glasgow's high-security Govan Police Station. The Security Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland were involved. A statement about the operation from Police Scotland Asst Ch Con Ruaraidh Nicolson said: "It focused on the activities of individuals sympathetic to dissident Republicanism but who are not affiliated to any specific group. "Police Scotland has led the operation which has involved a number of officers, including specialist units, and public safety has been a priority throughout. "We are confident as a result of these arrests there is no risk to the public. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage." </body>

      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at £54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of people have attended a service to remember nine people murdered in the Shankill bomb. A service to mark the 20th anniversary of the bombing took place in West Kirk Presbyterian Church. The DUP MP Willie McCrea has raised the anniversary of the bombing at Westminster. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, the South Antrim MP said that "no-one should equate victims with murderers". In response the prime minister said "no-one should glorify terrorism". He urged people in Northern Ireland to "come together for a shared future". During the service shops on the Shankill Road pulled down their shutters as a mark of respect and part of the road has been closed. Hundreds of people stood outside the church to hear the special memorial service. Pupils from the Harmony Primary School and the Girls Model laid flowers at a nearby memorial and at the actual bomb site further up the road. This coincided with the time the bomb went off exactly 20 years ago. Nine Protestant civilians were killed in the 1993 attack in Belfast, as well as one of the IRA bombers - Thomas Begley. Among the dead were two children aged seven and 13. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in October in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. </body>

      <title>Bank says UK prospects improving</title>
      <description>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to the Bank of England's latest minutes.</description>

      <body>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to Bank of England policymakers. Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's October meeting show that prospects for the rest of 2013 are better than was forecast in August. The minutes show that the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The MPC noted that business and consumer confidence continued to grow. The UK unemployment rate is currently at 7.7%. In August, when the Bank unveiled its strategy of forward guidance, the rate stood at 7.8%. At that time the Bank predicted it would take three years for the rate to fall to 7%, the rate at which it will start to consider interest rate rises. The October minutes said: "It now therefore seemed probable that unemployment would be lower, and output growth faster, in the second half of 2013 than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report." However, policymakers were divided about how fast productivity would pick up, and by extension, how fast unemployment would fall as the economy recovers. "It was too soon to draw a firm conclusion from recent labour market outturns about the extent to which productivity would increase," the minutes said. MPC members also noted a strengthening in sterling, which would push down on inflation. The Bank's goal is to return consumer price inflation to 2%. Inflation has exceeded 2% since December 2009, and currently stands at 2.7%. </body>

      <title>N Ireland 'UK's happiest nation'</title>
      <description>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests.</description>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>David Beckham inspires philosophy</title>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Pumpkin boat sets new 'world record'</title>
      <description>An artist claims he has set a new world record by paddling a giant pumpkin across a Portsmouth dock.</description>

      <body>An artist who works with outsized vegetables claims he has set a new world record of exactly two minutes for the fastest 100m paddle in a pumpkin. Dmitri Galitzine sourced two 600lb (270kg) and 800lb (360kg) squashes at the Mere Brow Giant Pumpkin Show. Speaking after his 100m paddle in Portsmouth, he said it had been "difficult" but paddling the pumpkin through the dock had "felt good". Guinness World Records said it had received notification of the attempt. Mr Galitzine, who also plans to cross the Solent from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight in a giant gourd powered by an outboard motor, spent days working with boating experts to create two pumpkin vessels. The larger pumpkin was fitted with an outboard motor for the Solent crossing, while the smaller one was hollowed out for the world record paddle attempt. His record attempt was recorded by independent adjudicators, and will be examined later, Guinness World Records said. It had said Mr Galitzine would have to complete the 100m paddle within three minutes to set a new record. Mr Galitzine, who creates giant vegetable sculptures influenced by English folk culture, has no sailing experience but was supported by Portsmouth marine entrepreneur Jonny Boys. His next challenge will be the three-mile crossing of the Solent on Thursday from Stokes Bay in Gosport, using a hollowed out pumpkin powered by an outboard engine. A handful of pumpkin regattas, in which boaters race each other in giant pumpkin ships, have been held in the US and Nova Scotia in Canada since the 1990s. A pumpkin boat race also took place in Hampshire in 2006. Mr Galitzine said that while sailing pumpkins was "not common... the crossing over the Solent is different to the regattas in the US, [as] it's over three miles and there are strong tides". </body>

      <body>A viable pipe bomb has been found during a security alert in Londonderry that left a number of people out of their homes on Wednesday morning. The device was thrown at a police vehicle on Charlotte Street, in the Bogside area, on Tuesday night. Charlotte Street has reopened as have Barrack Street and the Lecky flyover. "Someone could have died. I would be very surprised if this wasn't down to one of the dissident groups here," Chief Inspector Jon Burrows said. "Do they want to create headlines of murder and destruction? What they are portraying is anti-Derry." SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey said the alert had caused "major disruption". Army bomb experts were called but have since left the scene. "I understand an object was thrown at a PSNI Land Rover. Police then cordoned off the area until Army technical officers arrived," Mr Ramsey said. "This is utterly unacceptable and there are older people living in the area close-by who do not need this kind of disruption." </body>

      <title>PPS bids to reinstate Hamill charges</title>
      <description>The Public Prosecution Service launches a bid to reinstate criminal proceedings against three people in connection with Robert Hamill's murder.</description>

      <body>The Public Prosecution Service has launched a bid to reinstate criminal proceedings against three people in connection with Robert Hamill's murder. Mr Hamill was beaten by a loyalist mob in Portadown, County Armagh in April 1997. He never regained consciousness, dying in hospital 12 days later. The PPS challenge follows the decision to halt conspiracy to pervert the course of justice charges faced by the two men and a woman. They include a former RUC officer and his wife. Proceedings were stayed by a district judge earlier this year due to the perceived unreliability of a key witness in the case. Now the PPS is seeking to have that decision judicially reviewed. RUC officers in the area at the time of the attack have been accused of failing to intervene in the assault. One of those in a Land Rover at the scene was Robert Cecil Atkinson. The 59-year-old and his wife Eleanor Atkinson, with an address at Brownstown Road, Portadown, had both been accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice in connection with the investigation into the killing. Similar allegations were made against another man, Kenneth Hanvey, of Derryanvil Road, in the town. All three defendants had denied the claims against them. In July, District Judge Mervyn Bates stayed their cases on the grounds that there had been an abuse of process. He ruled that the evidence from a woman who was the central witness was so unreliable that a jury could not convict on it. His verdict is under challenge by the PPS, with the case due to be heard next month. During a preliminary mention on Wednesday, counsel for the prosecution service, Tony McGleenan QC, expressed confidence in clearing the first hurdle of establishing an arguable case. "It's not expected that there will be controversy about the granting of leave (to seek a judicial review) in this case," he told the court. It is anticipated that lawyers representing the Hamill family will be given notice party status to participate in the challenge. Mr Justice Treacy listed the case for hearing on 8 November. </body>

      <body>French travellers are leaving a hospital car park they have occupied since Saturday, blocking spaces reserved for medical staff. The travellers were warned to move from the Royal Gwent in Newport by Tuesday or face legal action. However, some of the 13 caravans remained - and it was only at about 16:00 BST on Wednesday that a procession of vehicles began leaving. One traveller told BBC Wales they had been waiting for a car to be fixed. The travellers, who said they were attending a funeral, arrived at the 300-space car park on Saturday, taking up 65 spaces. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away from the car park on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After the 16:00 BST deadline passed on Tuesday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, confirmed it would take legal action. "As you will be aware, the health board has requested that the travellers leave our hospital car park by 4pm [on Tuesday]," a board member said. "Given that the travellers are still here following our request, the health board confirms that it will now be taking legal proceedings to take back possession of the hospital car park." Julian Hayman, a spokesman for the hospital, said security staff would remain in the car park and that the situation would continue to be monitored. He added it was hoped the travellers would leave of their own accord without the need for potentially costly legal proceedings. "However, this has been passed to our legal department now and it will be dealing with the situation from here," he said. One of the travellers, Ringo Gogan, told the BBC they planned to leave for France at 17:00 BST once one of their cars had been repaired. He said they had come to Wales for a funeral and told police they were staying for a couple of days. </body>

      <body>An 81-year-old church minister has been arrested in south west Wales over an allegation of historical child abuse. Gwyn Ieuan Morgan from Johnstown, Carmarthen, has been suspended from duties at his two chapels pending the outcome of a police investigation. Dr Geraint Tudur, general secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, said members were "naturally traumatised". Dyfed Powys Police said the minister had been bailed while inquiries continue. Mr Morgan has served Bryn Iwan Chapel, near Cynwyl Elfed, and Moreia Chapel in Blaenwaun, north of St Clears, since 1972. Dr Tudur said: "As a charity which offers our members legal and pastoral support, we advised the churches involved to suspend their minister at once, pending the outcome of the investigation. "This advice was immediately acted upon by church trustees. "The church members are naturally traumatised by this development and the union is giving them continuing pastoral support." A statement from the group added: "The union has no power to enforce CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks and registration, although it regularly and strongly urges local churches to ensure that the procedure is followed." Dyfed Powys Police confirmed that "an 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with an historic allegation of sexual activity with a minor". "He remains on bail while inquiries continue," the force added. </body>

      <body>Calls for a ban on items of a sexual nature in Edinburgh's licensed saunas have been withdrawn. Police Scotland had written to councillors asking that licences should only be granted on the condition such items were not allowed on the premises. Safe sex campaigners were angered by the move, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. However, the condition was withdrawn from the council committee without any discussion. And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. Councillors granted new licenses to five of 13 city saunas. They are due to decide in private later whether the remaining eight saunas are also to be granted new licenses. Earlier this year, six other saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". </body>

      <body>Refined petrol and chemicals were among the stronger sectors of the Scottish economy, according to the latest manufactured export figures. According to the Scottish government, total overseas sales grew 3.5% in the second quarter of this year. Engineering also proved to be a strong factor. The strength of refining and chemicals underlined the importance of the closure-threatened Grangemouth complex for the economy. The data shows that refined petrol and chemicals account for nearly a quarter of manufactured goods sold to the rest of the world. Exports over the most recent quarter grew by 4.2%, which was at a slower pace than previous quarters. Overall following poor exports in the second half of 2012, the year-on-year figure for total manufactured exports was down 1.8%. Neil Francis, director of international operations at Scottish Development International, said: "These latest figures reinforce continued global demand for Scottish products, particularly those within the engineering, textiles, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. "With economic recovery gaining momentum, we are seeing more and more Scottish companies look to new and emerging markets such as Asia, Middle East, Africa and South America, as well as sustaining growth in the more traditional economies." He added: "We continue to work hard with our partners to help support ambitious companies with global potential and we are encouraged by the positive outlook for Scotland's manufactured exports." </body>

      <body>A woman has been killed in a fall of about 80ft (24m) from the third floor of a clothes store in Liverpool. Merseyside Police said she was found at the bottom of escalators on the ground floor of Primark in Church Street, at 18:00 BST on Tuesday. The 57-year-old woman had been seen moments before at a balcony next to the third-floor escalators. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. The coroner has been informed. She was treated by a doctor at the scene but was pronounced dead later at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. An North West Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the drop from the third-floor escalators was about 80ft. Liverpool City Council, which has health and safety responsibilities for the city's shops, said it was waiting for the results of police inquiries before deciding whether to investigate. Primark has not been available for comment. A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out later. Five years ago, at the same store, a three-year-old girl fell through a gap between the escalators to the lower ground floor while travelling up to the third floor with her family. She broke her left leg and arm and suffered internal injuries but survived. </body>

      <body>An MP has helped rescue a woman from the River Thames after seeing what he thought was a dead body float past him. Stephen Gilbert, MP for St Austell and Newquay, was at an event at the House of Commons terrace, overlooking the Thames, on Tuesday night. The Liberal Democrat said: "What looked like a body just floated past. Then I saw that the person then moved and I followed them down the terrace." He threw a lifebelt which the woman caught before being pulled out. The RNLI and Marine Police rescued her from the water near Westminster Pier. Mr Gilbert said: "There are some lifebuoys on the terrace, I guess this is not the first time something like this has happened." He added the shock had left him "barely able to string a sentence together". After the rescue he tweeted: "Shaken after seeing a body float past House of Commons terrace - she moved, I threw a life-buoy and she's now been rescued! #Result." The woman was taken to hospital. </body>

      <body>Ian Holloway has left his position as manager of Crystal Palace after less than a year in charge. It is unclear whether the 50-year-old resigned, was sacked, or left by mutual consent but the Premier League club are holding a news conference at 17:30 BST. Holloway guided Palace to promotion via the play-offs last season after joining in November 2012, and has won only one league game and lost seven this season. A 4-1 defeat by Fulham on Monday left the club five points adrift of safety. Speculation surrounded Holloway's job following a meeting with chairman Steve Parish after the loss to Fulham, with the pair believed to have held further talks on Tuesday. The former Blackpool manager said he spent a long time with his players immediately after the defeat. Speaking before the game at Selhurst Park, Parish had told BBC Radio 5 live that Holloway's position was secure. More to follow. </body>

      <title>Sheff Utd name Clough as manager</title>
      <description>Sheffield United appoint former Derby County boss Nigel Clough as their new manager to replace David Weir.</description>

      <body>Sheffield United have appointed former Derby County boss Nigel Clough as their new manager on a two-and-a-half-year deal. The 47-year-old, who was sacked by the Rams in September, replaces David Weir at Bramall Lane. Weir was dismissed earlier this month after winning just one of his 10 league matches in charge of the Blades. Clough's first game in charge of the struggling League One side is Saturday's home match against Crewe. Sheffield United co-chairman Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud told the club website:  "Nigel was the clear, first choice of the board. He brings an approach to the game that is well suited to what we are trying to achieve at Sheffield United. "Nigel has enjoyed managerial success in the game. He knows how to inspire first team players to give their all and has a proven track record of making an academy a key ingredient to the club's success. "We count ourselves lucky to have Nigel aboard." Former England international forward Clough started his managerial career with Burton Albion in 1998 after a successful playing career that took in stints with Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Manchester City. Having guided the Brewers to the top of the Conference Premier, he left to take over Derby in January 2009, following in the footsteps of his late father Brian, who managed the club to the league title in the 1970s. He was charged with cutting the wage bill and rebuilding the club after a disastrous one-season spell in the Premier League in 2007-08, where they had finished with a record low 11 points. In his four full seasons in charge of the East Midlands side he failed to take the club into the Championship play-offs but did nurture young talent including Will Hughes and Mason Bennett. Clough will become the fourth person to attempt to lead Sheffield United out of the third tier. Danny Wilson took them to the play-off final in his only full season before being replaced by Chris Morgan on a caretaker basis for the run-in last season. The Blades were beaten in the play-off semi-final by Yeovil and Weir was appointed on a three-year deal in June. After winning his first league game, the Scot was to pick up just two more points from his following nine league games and was sacked following a 1-0 Johnstone's Paint Trophy defeat by Hartlepool. Morgan again stepped into the breach and took four points from his three games in charge to stop the slide but Clough must now set about helping the club make up the 13-point gap on the top six. Clough brings former Derby coaches Gary Crosby and Andy Garner with him, while ex-skipper Morgan is being kept on. </body>

      <title>I have been treated unfairly - Hock</title>
      <description>Gareth Hock believes his breach of discipline was not serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad.</description>

      <body>Gareth Hock has told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. Hock overslept the next morning, missing a recovery session, and was informed of his dismissal in a phone conversation with coach Steve McNamara. "For missing a 10-minute swim - I think it's out of order really," said Hock. "I agree that it was wrong and we shouldn't have had a drink, but there were six or seven of us and we all did the same thing," he told BBC North West Tonight. England have said they will make no further comment about Hock's removal. Huddersfield's Brett Ferres has been added to the squad in his place. In a statement released late on Tuesday evening, they confirmed the Salford-bound second-rower had been taken out of the 24-man party "as a result of serious breaches of team discipline that have fallen below the strict code of conduct as agreed by team management". Hock's career has been littered with controversy, including a two-year ban after testing positive for cocaine in 2009, and he admitted he can understand why people may jump to conclusions about the nature of his indiscretion. He continued: "People are thinking the worst because of the way it's been handled. I know what people will be thinking, and that's up to them. It's come out wrong and people are thinking the worst. "That's the only thing that's happened and I only did the same as what the other lads did, apart from sleeping in for half an hour." An alcohol ban had been imposed on the England squad until after their World Cup opener against pre-tournament favourites Australia in Cardiff on 26 October. But Hock said the ban was broken after they lost their final warm-up match 15-14 to the unfancied Italians in Salford. The former Wigan Warriors man, who has won eight England caps, added: "A few of the boys went out for a few drinks and then went out for a bite to eat. We came back and I overslept. I missed a 10-minute swim and a 10-minute medical check-up. "We were told that there was no drinking until after the Australia game, but we were disappointed about the loss and a few of us had a few drinks. "We got a phone call from Steve to say he'd found out we'd been out, and he would be ringing us back with his decision. He rang me back and said he was going to be taking me out of the squad." Hock, who was unhappy not to be told the news face-to-face, continued: "I blew up a bit and he said the others would be getting disciplined as well, but then afterwards I found out that there was only me being taken out of the squad. I was gutted. I thought it was a bit harsh and I just needed a warning like they did. "I've worked really hard for this and the people in the camp will tell you that. It's embarrassing. "All I can say is 'sorry' again for what I did do, but it's nothing bad compared to what people are thinking." Viewers in the BBC North West region can watch the full extended interview in North West Tonight on BBC One at 18:30 BST on Wednesday evening. </body>

      <title>The cult of the French pastry chef</title>

      <body>No French high street would be complete without a patisserie, and words such as "gateau", "eclair" and "flan" indicate that French pastry chefs are esteemed as much abroad as at home. But in the last couple of years, patissiers have shot to stardom, joining the top ranks of France's celebrity chefs. French patisserie used to be delicious but predictable - the chocolate eclair, the vanilla or raspberry flavoured macaroon, the classic French apple tart or the mille-feuille (a sophisticated vanilla slice). Something has changed. Ever heard of the caramel popcorn, pistachio-orange or pecan eclair by Christophe Adam? Or the olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water by Pierre Herme? These are a couple of the audacious creations a new generation of French pastry chefs have launched on a startled but delighted French public. France has always loved patisserie, but for some reason it now loves its patissiers more than ever. Their books are filling the shelves of book shops, and their stores are multiplying - five new "patisseries de luxe" opened in the month of September, in Paris alone. And while The Great British Bake Off has gone from strength to strength, France has developed its own competitive baking shows, such as this year's Who Will be the Next Great Patissier? For the last episode contestants had to make a piece of fashion out of chocolate. Another show, The Gateau of My Dreams, where a chef goes to someone's house to help them bake a challenging cake or dessert, began in February 2012 - starting with mille-feuille with caramelised maple syrup, and Black Forest gateau with acidulated morello cherry - and published a spin-off book in its first year. One explanation for the sudden rise of the pastry chef is as a consequence of the recession. In these times of crisis, patisserie has become a relatively affordable luxury - compared say with going to the restaurant - says Sebastien Gaudard, one of today's up-and-coming pastry chefs. He has noticed a change in his customers' habits. Instead of buying a big cake for a Sunday lunch or a dinner party, couples are now more likely to visit during the week to buy one or two patisseries for themselves alone. Patisserie, he says, is a form of comfort food. "What drives the world of sweets, I think, is that eating sweets brings us back to a time in our lives when we had no worries, the carefree time of childhood." But the growing enthusiasm for patisserie is also due to the fact that a new generation of pastry chefs have re-invented their craft, according to Zakari Benkhadra, managing director of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de la Patisserie (ENSP), in the countryside south of Lyon. Chefs have started to make elaborate and visually interesting creations using techniques such as mixing sweetness and saltiness (salty macaroons), creating original shapes (an audio cassette shaped pistachio-chocolate bar) or making surprising high-quality desserts using mainstream products such as Haribo sweets and Nutella. A parallel piece of culinary invention, which made headlines earlier this year, was the cronut - a cross between a croissant and a donut - created by French chef Dominique Ansel in New York. The patisserie craze has had a direct impact on the ENSP's enrolment numbers. Struggling to fill some classes in 2008, it now turns away some applicants for lack of space. But not all the top patissiers are modernising traditional recipes and improvising with new tastes. Sebastien Gaudard represents another trend, which is to return to authentic and relatively simple creations. "My wish is to render the past marvellously present," says Gaudard, 43. Gaudard, the son of a famous pastry chef in Lorraine, eastern France, is one of a number of contemporary pastry chefs who served an apprenticeship at the Paris institution, Fauchon, which is famed above all for its patisserie. Since November 2011 he has run a shop in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, selling delicacies from the past that are no longer always available in every patisserie. These include the Puits d'amour, a dessert created by the 18th Century chef Vincent La Chapelle, its hollow centre stuffed with vanilla cream, and the classic Paris-Brest, made of choux pastry and a praline-flavoured cream, inspired by the Paris-Brest-Paris cycle race - its circular shape representing a bicycle wheel. A speciality is the Mussipontain a cake made of meringue, vanilla cream and caramelised almonds whose name derives from the inhabitants of the city of Pont-à-Mousson, Gaudard's home town. This is his father's own creation. But whether people prefer startling creativity or traditional pastries, all pastry chefs are out to please their customers - and the customers evidently enjoy being pleased. "We sell pleasure," says Gaudard. "People come to us for pleasure." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Outfoxing the urban fox</title>
      <description>Many might want to do something about urban foxes in their area. There's an increasingly popular and humane way to outwit them.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563919</url>
      <date>1382403985</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70637000/jpg/_70637618_grass.ts.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK's towns and cities. Outwitting the wily creatures is becoming an increasingly popular way to control them humanely. There are many people who dislike urban foxes. They have been blamed for biting babies and killing penguins at London Zoo, but others feed them and treat them like pets. Foxes first colonised UK towns and cities in the 1940s and an estimated 33,000 now live in them, according to research by Bristol University. There are thought to be 16 per square mile in London alone. Dealing with urban foxes is complicated. They are protected under a series of wildlife laws and it is only permissible to control numbers in very limited ways. Even then methods such as shooting often aren't appropriate in urban areas. But there are a small number of fox experts specialising in dealing with them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. They are getting up to 50 calls a week from people who need help but don't want the fox harmed. Killing foxes is pointless in urban areas, they argue, because another one will quickly take its place. Fox experts agree. "A fox will constantly mark its territory," says John Bryant, who is based in Tonbridge, Kent, and was one of the first people to offer humane deterrence. "The moment it stops it's obvious to others foxes that it isn't there any more and they will move in. So if you shoot a fox another will colonise the vacant territory in a matter of days." The humane approach is about disturbing a fox's normal behaviour and, crucially, moving it to another part of its territory. This means its scent will still be left around the area so no other foxes will move in. "Foxes repeat behaviour day after day but they are very smart and if an area becomes hostile they will move somewhere else," says Terry Woods, co-founder of Fox-A-Gon, which operates in London and the South East. A fox's territory can cover up to 40 acres and in urban areas can include up to 400 gardens, says Bryant. If you deter it from one garden it could have another 399 to choose from, he says. "It might only move to a garden a few doors down but that person might not think the fox is a problem. It's obviously going to return to a garden where it is welcome, not one where it isn't." Methods used are often simple. One of the most popular, and most effective, is motion-activated sprinklers that repel foxes with a short but startling burst of water. Underground cameras are also used to hunt out and block hidden routes that foxes use to get in an area. Brookside, a street in north London, typifies the divide of opinion there often is when it comes to urban foxes. One resident, Sofia, has chickens and worries they will be killed by foxes. She has used many methods to deter them, including human hair after reading on the internet that foxes don't like the smell. "It was a bit of a random request but my mum went to the hairdressers and asked for a bag of hair," she says. "I've wedged it in certain places but foxes have pulled it out. If a fox killed my chickens I'd be absolutely devastated." Nobby lives a few doors down and has been feeding local foxes for years, luring them into his garden with dog food and biscuits. "There are a lot of people round here that say 'you and your foxes are making a lot of noise and they're digging holes in my garden'. I tell them to go boil their heads." Common complaints about foxes can usually be narrowed down to mess, pungent-smelling faeces, digging holes and noise. They screech when they fight over territory or female foxes during mating season. But fox lovers point out that other animals, such as pet cats and dogs, are also responsible for such behaviour. Fox experts say there are many common myths surrounding foxes, including that they scavenge in bins every night and kill for fun. Both are untrue, they argue. Other people may beg to differ. Problems are often because of people and not foxes, say the experts. "You shouldn't encourage foxes into your home or try to tame them," says Stephen Harris, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol and an expert on foxes. "They are incredibly intelligent but, just like people, they are all different. They will have different responses - some will be friendly but some won't." He says fox attacks are extremely rare but the animals do explore using their teeth and nip things to see what they are. "It's usually exploratory, inquisitive behaviour but you don't want to be on the receiving end. "Britain has some of the highest-density fox populations in the world but they cause remarkably few problems. There are many benefits of having foxes in urban areas, including being nature's pest controllers when it comes to rats and feral pigeons. "The vast majority of householders like to see the foxes in their garden. It's a bit of the countryside in town." But fox supporters do, however, recognise they can be a nuisance. Vixens give birth around March and the cubs are normally driven out to find their own territories by their parents in the late summer and autumn. "When the adolescent foxes are kicked out of home they become teenage hooligans," says Bryant. "They come down streets in gangs and cause trouble. I've known them to bite through the brake pipes on cars. It's very rare, but I have dealt with a few cases." But at the end of the day the argument for humane controls is simple, say those in the business. "We can't exist in isolation," says Woods. "Nature runs in harmony and foxes are an important part of the ecosystem. If you start taking out what you don't like - the squirrels, the foxes, the badgers - you end up with nothing."

      <title>Smashed Hits: The Windmills Of Your Mind</title>
      <description>The Windmills Of Your Mind was made famous by Noel Harrison, who's died aged 79. Why has it stood the test of time?</description>

      <body>"Round... like a circle in a spiral, a wheel within a wheel..." so begins The Windmills Of Your Mind, made famous by Noel Harrison. Why has the song lasted so long, asks Ben Milne. Only two minutes and 20 seconds long in the version by Harrison, who's died aged 79, Windmills of Your Mind is a rush of lyrical free association about turning circles, spirals and the passage of time ("The autumn leaves were turning to the colour of her hair"). With its imagery of "a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own" and apples "whirling silently in space" Windmills occupies a singular place in the pop canon where psychedelia and easy listening meet. "It's a very peculiar and intriguing song," says Bob Stanley, musician and author of pop history Yeah Yeah Yeah. "It gets called easy listening but really isn't at all." Stanley says the song was the product of a short-lived era, post-Sgt Pepper, "where what had been the straight set... jumped on the psychedelia bandwagon". It was written by French composer Michel Legrand, with English lyrics by husband-and-wife team Alan and Marilyn Bergman (a French version, Les Moulins de mon coeur, was also penned by Eddy Marnay) and was used to memorable effect in the Steve McQueen thriller The Thomas Crown Affair (it won the Oscar for best song in 1968). But what do the lyrics mean? The poet Ian McMillan says Windmills Of Your Mind is similar to some modernist poetry where meanings are kept deliberately mysterious and confusing. He thinks the lyrics are deceptively shallow and warns poetry students not to use them as a template: "People will write something like 'the walls of my despair' or 'the settee of my soul'. 'Windmills of your mind' is a great phrase, and it's a fantastic song, but the words appear to mean something when they don't." Nevertheless the song has become a standard, covered by more than 80 recording artists, as diverse as Dusty Springfield, ex-Specials singer Terry Hall, the Muppets and Kiri Te Kanawa. But for many, it's Noel Harrison's version which still endures, as he delivers in his clipped English accent, "Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that she said?"

      <title>PM to review fixed odds machines</title>
      <description>David Cameron promises to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from High Street betting shops.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to £100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at £100 and the maximum payout at £500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <title>Parking ticket 'grace' period urged</title>
      <description>Councils in England should give drivers five minutes grace after their parking tickets run out before fining them, a committee of MPs says.</description>

      <body>Drivers should be given "five minutes grace" after their parking tickets expire before facing fines, MPs on the Commons transport committee say. It also said councils in England should publish annual parking-charge accounts if they want to prove they are not being used as a "cash cow" The Transport Committee warned it was "neither acceptable nor legal" to use fines to increase revenue. Councils made a surplus of hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it added. The MPs urged ministers to freeze charges, currently capped at £130 in London and £70 outside. Councils said money raised went back into services. Committee chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said: "There is a deep-rooted public perception that parking enforcement is used as a cash cow, so it's essential that local authorities apply stringent transparency." The report said the Local Government Association had calculated a surplus from on- and off-street parking of £411m in 2011/12, while the RAC Foundation put the figure at £565m. The maximum fixed penalty for speeding is £60, unless the case is referred to court. Mrs Ellman argued the charging system was perverse, saying: "Annual parking accounts would allow the public to see how much local revenue is derived from the enforcement of fines, and what proportion of this come from on- or off-street parking charges. "It's right that parking charges be determined locally, but hard to justify fines that substantially exceed penalties for more serious offences like speeding. "Central government should freeze the maximum penalty charge and develop differential fines for less serious parking violations. " Mrs Ellman also said the Department for Transport's rules for councils should include a five-minute "grace-and-favour" period after tickets expire before imposing a fine. A government spokesman said: "We welcome this report, which strengthens the case for changes to be made to parking rules. "The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This government is reining in over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair parking practices, with the levels of parking penalty charges being kept under review." But Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said: "As this report recognises, parking controls are not being used by councils to raise revenue. They are essential for keeping motorists and pedestrians safe, traffic flowing and ensure people can park near their homes and local shops." He added: "Councils always look to be open and transparent with residents on their parking policies. "Any income they make from charges and fines is spent on running parking services, fixing potholes and providing subsidised travel to children and the elderly." Last month, the government said it was considering banning fixed cameras and so-called "spy cars" used by councils to catch people parking illegally. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the idea of getting councils to publish figures, saying it would "illuminate what many drivers regard as the murky world of parking policy". "Parking charges are not inherently wrong but they need to be fair, and where penalties are levied they should be proportionate to the 'crime' committed. "Local authorities are struggling with huge financial pressures but so are drivers. It is unacceptable that car users should be singled out as an easy way of shoring up shrinking budgets." </body>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than £500 a week, while a £350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given £1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add £2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <description>How do people avoid picking a terrible flatmate?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24622858</url>
      <date>1382524267</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70656000/jpg/_70656535_shallowgrave.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <title>Afghan Sandhurst opens its doors</title>
      <description>Term begins at new Afghan officer academy</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24629331</url>

      <body>The first cadets for the new Afghan National Army officer academy could not all arrive on the same day, because travel from the country's outlying provinces can be hazardous. But as term begins, more than 200 of the expected 270 new recruits in the first intake are in place. Dubbed Sandhurst in the Sand - and modelled on its namesake institution in the UK - the academy will be Britain's only military presence in the country once combat troops have left next year. It aims to take raw but enthusiastic candidates and turn them into the military leaders of the future, able to lead the growing ranks of ordinary Afghan soldiers. The recruits have come from all over the country, and from a wide range of backgrounds. One group queuing up to receive their uniforms, basic sports kit and toiletries included a teacher, a tailor and several recent university graduates. They said they had joined up to defend their country - and they know the scale of the challenge ahead when international troops pull out. More than 1,000 Afghan soldiers were killed last year, with 3,000 seriously injured. The former tailor, Mohammed Navid, from the north of the country, said: "After 2014 all of the American forces will have gone from my province. We have to achieve our security." The ex-teacher, Sadek, said he wanted to serve his country, but was frank about needing a job. A makeshift army camp in tents is housing the first students, as the academy buildings will not be completed for another year. But "it doesn't matter if we are in tents or in a palace", according to Lt Col Graham Hyland, who is leading a team of mentors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. "The key thing is getting started, and getting young warrior leaders that the Afghan National Army wants out on to the field." A visit to the camp barber was the first necessity for the recruits, where a close "number one" cut was the only style on offer. Then they were put into small units - "tolay" in Afghan army jargon. Part of the Sandhurst method is that each tolay should be led by a regular army sergeant, and much of the instruction is by sergeants and other non-commissioned officers, or NCOs. Culturally, it might have been problematic to expect officers to be ordered around by a sergeant, but those running the course hope that once the system is accepted, this will improve relationships in the Afghan army beyond the officers, boosting leadership skills throughout. Col Hyland said it had been a challenge at first when the instructors were being trained, but the substance of the course was what mattered. "They're instructing them in all of the tasks we would have the senior NCOs at Sandhurst doing - in drill, skill at arms, map reading, and fieldcraft." The academy is set in a long, low ridge of hills close to Kabul, with plenty of open ground to learn tactics. And the course has been altered significantly to make it Afghan-specific. The military history syllabus includes the analysis of Afghan tactics in past wars against the British, as well as during the mujahideen wars against the Soviet army. There were 10,000 applicants and they were examined anonymously, so theoretically it should not be possible for influential families to secure a place. Without any artificial quotas, those accepted broadly reflect the tribal divisions of the country. This will be far harder to do when the women's course begins next year, as almost all of the female candidates have been from the Hazara ethnic group - the third largest in the country. The overall British commander, Brig Gen Maurice Sheen, said it was important to forge an Afghan national identity in the academy, and not focus on tribal and ethnic backgrounds. He said the country had a warrior tradition, but recruits needed to be taught to be tactically aware. There is a view among international advisers to the Afghan National Army that casualties within its ranks are higher than they need to be, and better leadership in the field would reduce them. Gen Sheen said the students were willing to learn: "They'll sit for a long long time - quite deferential - which can be a problem at times because we have to encourage them to ask more questions. "They have a longer concentration span than we have and seem like sponges. They are open to whatever we are telling them." This first intake will emerge fully qualified as officers next September, and there will be two more groups joining during the year. For those who have been working over the past year to deliver the course, like Col Hyland, watching the new recruits arrive was a good moment. "I couldn't help but grin the whole day," he said. "It was really delightful to see them, cutting around and doing stuff, getting their kit issued, all those sorts of things. "All those vague memories I have got of Sandhurst, and now here we are at the officer's academy at Qargha - it was really good. I was really proud." </body>

      <title>How dangerous are false widow spiders?</title>
      <description>How dangerous is Britain's most venomous spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <description>10 ways christenings have changed since 1982</description>

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <title>Sex Pistols 'took over my house'</title>
      <description>How a Sex Pistols collection became an obsession</description>

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid £100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had £2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <title>Why Grangemouth matters</title>
      <description>The economic significance of the Grangemouth plant</description>

      <body>Ineos says the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth is to close while the oil refinery will remain open. Around 800 jobs will be affected by the closure. In total Grangemouth employs 1,370 staff and a dispute between union members and staff remains unresolved. The loss of the petrochemicals plant is a major blow and now the focus will be on the refinery which is a key part of the Scottish and UK economy. The Grangemouth refinery supplies 70% of the fuel used at Scotland's filling stations and it also supplies fuel to Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. Grangemouth is an important employer and the 800 jobs lost by the closure of the petrochemicals plant are a big loss. Along with the refinery, Grangemouth employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the site. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the business is losing £10m a month and needs an investment of £300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth's refinery is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is due to close. </body>

      <title>Papers turn heat on energy firms</title>
      <description>Papers turn heat on energy firms</description>

      <body>Fuel bills may be rising, but pictures in the Sun and the Daily Star show the deserted night-time offices of energy companies "ablaze with light". "They must have money to burn," says the Sun. The Star thinks it goes to show that the big companies are "power mad" - "truly, the lights are on," it says, "but there's nobody at home". The papers know what they think about rising fuel bills - but Sir John Major's call for a windfall tax has led some to revise their view of him. The Daily Mirror calls him "the grey man of British politics" - but says his "explosive intervention" into the political argument has turned him into "an unexpected assassin for Mr Cameron". The Guardian, too, reads his remarks as sending "a political thunderbolt into Downing Street". But the Daily Telegraph points out that "Sir John is in close contact with David Cameron" and it wonders whether he was "flying a kite" for Number 10, testing public opinion. The Times considers that idea too - but rejects it. The paper also rejects Sir John's proposal, saying extraordinary tax measures "may be tempting in the short run" but are "rarely wise" because they undermine the confidence of investors in Britain. Another jolt to received opinion can be found in the Daily Express. The paper's front page boldly declares that "eating fat is good for you". Basing its article on the views of a London heart specialist, the Express questions the conventional advice that people should reduce the amount of saturated fats they eat to minimise the risk of disease. A cartoon on the front of the Times shows a man at breakfast, reading a story that urges him to "eat more butter" and telling his wife that "middle-age spread is good for you". Frances Quinn, "the shock winner" of the Great British Bake Off, is declared by the Daily Express to be Britain's new "Queen of the Kitchen". Almost all the papers find the show irresistible. "Don't let its daintiness fool you," says the Independent, "the programme is a fearsome behemoth of popular television." "Sponge cakes, sex appeal and icing sugar," exclaims the Daily Mail, "what a combination." The Guardian gives space on its front page to one of the defeated finalists, Ruby Tandoh, to voice her concern that the "hyperbolic silliness" of "a programme about cake" could inspire so much "bitterness and bile", even "personal vitriol and misogyny", among commentators on social media and in the press. Perhaps it is the mix of emotions which appeals - the Daily Telegraph comments that "if Premier League baking gets any more popular, next year could well be a bid by BT for the TV rights". David Beckham is felt to be on the receiving end of some, perhaps unfair, remarks in Sir Alex Ferguson's memoirs. "Now that the power's faded," comments the Daily Mirror, "all that's left is settling a few old scores." The Daily Star pays tribute to Sir Alex as "arguably Britain's most successful club manager, ever". But it disputes his estimate of Beckham as someone who failed to fulfil his potential. The Times itemises the former England captain's sporting record, his wealth and his place in world culture. The paper observes: "What a terrible disappointment it must be to be David Beckham." </body>
