      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Forensic investigators are still combing through the rubble of Westgate - no bodies have yet been identified and it is not known whether the attackers are alive or dead. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. Watch the full report in Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <title>Litigation 'could paralyse' military</title>
      <description>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential think tank warns.</description>

      <body>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential right-leaning think tank has warned. A report for Policy Exchange says legal action may paralyse the armed forces. It highlights a surge in legal claims against the Ministry of Defence - totalling 5,827 in 2012-13. But lawyers for the families of service personnel dismissed the findings as "political" and "biased". The report says litigation has led to the MoD employing around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year. Entitled 'the Fog of Law', it points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces. The report's authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer, teaching international and operational law. The main "weapon" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), they argue. Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts. This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts. In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government using Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision thrown out by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR. This year, the Supreme Court ruled that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. The report's authors claim that in the long run, "legal creep" could pose a "mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed." They say that the extension of law risks "catastrophically weakening the UK". And they claim it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. Military personnel should not be above the law, says Lt Col Tugendhat. But he added: "As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended." Their report recommends that: But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions. "This report seems to me to be part of a concerted political attack on the Human Rights Act," said Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones and Allen. "Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad. "It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat." Martyn Day from the law firm Leigh Day, which has also fought several high profile cases against the MoD, labelled the report "biased". He said his firm would argue that it is "the breaking of laws which poses the greatest threat to those who risk all for their country. "This includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone." He added: "Greater adherence to the laws, both domestic and international, are the only way in which the MoD's litigation will decrease." The arguments in the report echoed those of the Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, who remains concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements, which could make it more difficult for troops to carry out operations in the future. </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases of human trafficking discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to new government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often trafficked for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims of trafficking were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims are brought to the UK do anything from work as house slaves to work in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work, in particular laying paving, drives or ground work. Other victims are forced to work in nail bars or takeaways. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud. The trafficking gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to their victims. Those targeted by the traffickers are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes members of their own family. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. She also said the government's Modern Slavery Bill would contain new anti-trafficking measures, including: </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The lettings group said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. </body>

      <title>Complaints over immigration texts</title>
      <description>The Home Office receives more than 140 complaints after sending text messages which wrongly accused recipients of being illegal immigrants.</description>

      <body>Home Office texts wrongly accusing people of being illegal immigrants have prompted more than 140 complaints. Among those contacted was a veteran civil rights campaigner who has lived in Britain since 1966. Officials have sent messages to almost 40,000 people they suspect of not having a right to be in the UK. Meanwhile, a minister has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be rolled out across the UK. Mark Harper, the immigration minister, told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. His department defended texting people urging them to contact border officials to discuss their immigration status. "We believe it is right to enforce the rules," the Home Office said. "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." It said only 14 people had been contacted in error. But two of them - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the messages. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear." Ministers awarded outsourcing company Capita the contract to trace people believed to have outstayed their visas. The message read: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The complaints come after the government was criticised for using vans with a picture of handcuffs telling immigrants to "go home" if they were not entitled to be in the UK. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. But Mr Harper told Question Time he did not "have any problem" with the overall message and if they had proved successful could be used in other parts of the country. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". And his party colleague, Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, who has since lost his job, said the Lib Dems would not "be agreeing any proposals to bring them back". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper said: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." He added: "It's a pilot. We are assessing the results at the moment." Mr Harper also said: "We are going to publish the results when we have done the evaluation. If it's successful, we will roll it out. If it's not, we won't." </body>

      <description>Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed.</description>

      <body>Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The blazes are continuing to burn in the outskirts of Sydney, despite the easing of temperatures and winds. One man has died while trying to protect his home. Prime Minister Tony Abbott visited Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, one of the areas worst-hit by the fires, around 70km (45 miles) west of Sydney. Correspondents say bushfires are common in Australia but they have come earlier than normal this year, sparking concerns of further problems to come. Deputy New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service Commissioner Rob Rogers said the fire situation was the worst he had seen in more than a decade and the threat was unlikely to ease for some time. "We've got thousands of kilometres of fire front that we are faced with trying to deal with," he told local media. Hundreds of residents spent Thursday night in evacuation centres, with many returning home to find their houses razed. Fire fighters described blazes as tall as 20m to 30m (100ft). A 63-year-old man died from a heart attack as he tried to defend his home in Lake Munmorah, in the Central Coast region of NSW, on Thursday afternoon. Around 2,000 fire fighters across the state worked to try and contain the fires but many are still burning out of control, says the BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney. Mr Abbott, in Winmalee, said of those helping to battle the fires: "These are ordinary people who, on an extraordinary day, come together to support their community and to protect their fellow Australians." At least three fire fighters have been reported injured. Officials were still trying to determine the number of homes affected by the fire, with reports estimating the loss of as many as 200 homes. The fires have been caused by unseasonably hot temperatures and strong winds. While these have now died down, more hot weather is forecast next week. "It's been an awful 24 hours for the Blue Mountains [region]," Mayor Mark Greenhill told Nine Network Television. "We've lost possibly scores of homes." Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told local media that the situation remained "very active, very dynamic, very dangerous", despite the cooler conditions. Around 500 sq km (200 sq miles) had been burnt out so far, he added. Ron Fuller, who lost his home in Winmalee, told ABC News: "We've had a number of fires through here before but this was an extraordinary fire. The speed was extraordinary, it just raced through this whole area, took out some houses, left other ones standing." Jodie Harrison, Mayor of Lake Macquarie, said that four heritage homes, as well as a historic jetty, were caught in the fire. "It's been confirmed that four houses in the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay have been lost," she told local media. NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell, in an interview on broadcaster 7 News, called the fires "some of the worst we have experienced around Sydney in living memory". "We're in for a long, tough summer," he added. Alex Chesser, a District Officer with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told the BBC that the fires had come unusually early. "It's... a combination of a couple years of quite wet summers and winters which have allowed the bush to continue to grow at high rates, and also prevented us undertaking as many hazard reduction burns as we'd like," he said. Smoke and ash from the wildfires blanketed the Sydney skyline on Thursday. New South Wales was also hit by bush fires in September, which injured several fire fighters.

      <title>Transsexual PC sues Essex police</title>
      <description>A transsexual police officer is suing her force after she allegedly had to "out" herself over a police radio system, the BBC learns.</description>

      <body>A transsexual police officer is suing her force after she allegedly had to "out" herself over a police radio system, the BBC has learned. PC Emma Chapman claims Essex Police failed to help its officers understand transgender issues and properly investigate what had happened. The case, believed to be the first of its kind, was heard at an employment tribunal which is now considering its findings. Essex Police disputes the allegations. PC Chapman, 44, was born male and underwent gender reassignment in 1999 while serving as a volunteer officer with Essex Police. Four years later she became a full-time constable and now works on the force's response team. It is thought she is the only transgender officer in the force. PC Chapman said that after initially telling people about the sex change and raising awareness of transgender issues at conferences, she became "frustrated" at the lack of support and understanding about the problems transsexuals faced. She decided not to be "open" any longer and "stepped away" from dealing with transgender issues in 2009. According to legal documents, seen by the BBC, her claim centres on three incidents when she had to speak to the police force's control room via her radio handset. PC Chapman says that on the first occasion, in October 2012, the operator did not believe who she was, saying she had a "male voice". In her witness statement, the police constable said: "I felt a combination of alarm and distress. " I replied... 'I am a transsexual'. "I felt very embarrassed and desperate. The incident took my breath away." PC Chapman said she was left feeling "very distressed" that she'd had to "out" herself over a radio channel that was listened to by hundreds of officers and staff. She reported what had happened but claims Essex police failed to carry out a full investigation and interview the control room operator. Legal papers say two further incidents occurred in June 2013 when the officer was again challenged by control room staff who questioned her identity. "I felt a growing sense of apprehension whenever I had to use the radio, concerned that there may be further, similar incidents," she said. "The radio is also a lifeline at times and I should not have to feel hesitant or anxious about using it." PC Chapman, who's a Police Federation constables representative in Essex, secured the backing of the federation to bring legal proceedings against the force. The officer said the incidents created an "intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment" for her to work in. She is seeking compensation for injury to her feelings and a declaration of discrimination and wants the force to improve the way it deals with transgender issues. Essex Police said it "disagreed" with PC Chapman's assertions and was contesting the case. A spokesman acknowledged that conversations between PC Chapman and the control room had taken place but said the force disputed the "precise wording and tone" said to have been used. The case was heard at the East London Tribunal Court last week after PC Chapman turned down an out-of-court settlement. A decision is expected in the next few months. It is thought that, if she is is successful, PC Chapman could receive compensation of up to £3,000, though her main objective is said to be to highlight the way transgender people are treated. Roy Scanes, Essex Police Federation's branch board secretary, confirmed that PC Chapman had the federation's backing for what was an "important" and "unusual" case but declined to comment until there had been a ruling. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <title>Most people 'have spiritual beliefs'</title>
      <description>Most people in the UK believe in the power of spiritual forces on earth, despite a decline in church attendance, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite the falling popularity of organised religion, most people in the UK still believe in the power of spiritual forces, research suggests. A study for the Christian think tank Theos recorded 77% as believing some things could not be explained by science or any other means. Among the other findings, 8% said they or someone they knew had experienced a miracle, while one-in-four expressed a belief in angels. ComRes surveyed just over 2,000 people. "The study appears to confirm that, despite a steady decline in congregations and in formal religious belief, a sense of the spiritual remains strong in Britain," said the BBC's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott. Only a quarter of those questioned thought spiritual forces had no influence on earth. And almost two-thirds of those who identified themselves as Christians thought such spiritual forces could influence people's thoughts or the natural world. More than a third of the non-religious shared that belief. Between 2001 and 2011, the proportion of people in England and Wales identifying themselves as Christian fell from 72% to 59%. In the last census a quarter of the population said they had no religion - up from 15% 10 years earlier. "Some secularists have concluded from these trends that over recent decades Britain has become more secular, or more sceptical, or more rational," says Theos in its "belief in post-religious Britain" report. "But the picture is actually very different - more complex and more interesting - than that." </body>

      <title>Housework 'not strenuous enough'</title>
      <description>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found.</description>

      <body>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found. It had been thought they could count towards the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense activity per week. But the BMC Public Health study, which surveyed over 4,500 adults, found those who counted housework were heavier than those who did other activities. Experts said activities only counted when they made breathing more rapid and the heart beat faster. NHS recommendations do say housework does not count towards the 150-minute goal. But the researchers in this paper say there has been a move towards promoting a "lifestyle approach" to physical activity - encouraging "domestic" activities in people who may not take part in sports or go to the gym. And they warn that, while any activity is better than none, people should be aware that they still need to meet the moderate activity target on top. Participants completed a detailed interview about their activity levels, whether they played any sports or did formal exercise as well as their diet and smoking and drinking habits. They were particularly asked about activity linked to looking after their homes. Domestic housework in 10 minute bursts or more accounted for 36% of the reported moderate to vigorous physical activity people said they did. But when weight and height were taken into account, researchers found that those who counted housework as exercise were heavier than people doing other exercise for the same amount of time. Among women, just a fifth reached the weekly exercise target if housework was discounted. The research team, which included experts from the Universities of Ulster, Sheffield Hallam and Wolverhampton as well as Sport Northern Ireland concluded: "Domestic physical activity accounts for a significant proportion of self-reported daily moderate to vigorous physical activity particularly among females and older adults. "However such activity is negatively associated with leanness, suggesting that such activity may not be sufficient to provide all of the benefits normally associated with meeting the physical activity guidelines." Prof Marie Murphy, from the University of Ulster, who led the study, said: "Housework is physical activity and any physical activity should theoretically increase the amount of calories expended. "But we found that housework was inversely related to leanness, which suggests that either people are overestimating the amount of moderate intensity physical activity they do through housework, or are eating too much to compensate for the amount of activity undertaken." She added: "When talking to people about the amount of physical activity they need to stay healthy, it needs to be made clear that housework may not be intense enough to contribute to the weekly target and that other more intense activities also need to be included each week." Chris Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Your exercise should make you breathe harder, feel warmer, and make your heart beat faster than usual. "So, unless your household chores tick all these boxes, they won't count. "If you're daunted by the prospect of a 150-minute target, think of it in 10-minute chunks. "It doesn't necessarily mean forking out for a gym membership either - try a brisk walk on your lunch break or make a resolution to take the stairs rather than the lift each morning." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <title>England will not be World Cup seed</title>
      <description>England rise to 10th in the Fifa rankings, but will not be one of eight seeded teams at next year's World Cup in Brazil.</description>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday. Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament. England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches. But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December. The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded. But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body. Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament. Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions. England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay. Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy. The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football. Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations. France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system. "From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder. He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points. As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier. Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot. Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign. Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel. </body>

      <title>Di Resta 'faces uncertain F1 future'</title>
      <description>Paul Di Resta's manager admits the Formula 1 future of the 27-year-old Scottish driver is not guaranteed.</description>

      <body>Paul Di Resta's manager admits the Scot faces an uncertain future in Formula 1. The 27-year-old's Force India team have an option on him for 2014 but there are no guarantees they will retain him. And Richard Goddard, who represents Di Resta, is concerned the team could opt for a driver who brings sponsorship and leave his client without a drive. "It's difficult to know what will happen - there are a lot of drivers in the sport with money and a lot of teams that need money," Goddard said. "That is probably the biggest issue, that it is not just outright talent that gets you a seat in the car any more. "But Force India have always been very fair in that they have tended to put outright talent in the car and they haven't looked to a driver to bring in income, which is great. "That's because they are well funded by a couple of individuals and corporations who are able to do that - and hopefully they will carry on doing that. "Some other teams are looking for drivers to bring in income, and unfortunately Paul doesn't have a government-backed scheme or a rich billionaire standing behind him." Di Resta's future may not, though, be determined by a so-called 'pay-driver'. Force India are one of the teams in negotiations with the highly-rated Sauber driver Nico Hulkenberg, who was Di Resta's team-mate in 2012. BBC F1 chief analyst Eddie Jordan said at the Japanese Grand Prix last weekend that he was "fairly sure" Hulkenberg would race for Force India next year. "I believe, in my opinion, it is certain," Jordan said, adding: "My reputation rests on it." Some sources say that if Hulkenberg does re-sign for Force India, the team would drop Di Resta and keep their other driver Adrian Sutil, even though he and Hulkenberg are both German. Hulkenberg, though, is also in the frame at Lotus. Sources close to Lotus say they intend to sign him but are trying to sort out a partnership with a US-Middle Eastern investment consortium called Quantum Motorsports before concluding the contract. The proposed deal with Quantum has been dragging on since the summer, when the group were called Infinity Racing, before changing their name to Quantum to avoid confusion with a sponsor of word champions Red Bull, the Nissan luxury car brand Infiniti. Di Resta's cause has not been helped by an abject run of form in the second half of the season, which is partly due to the team's loss of pace following a change in the construction of the Pirelli tyres. He scored points in seven of the first eight races this year but the team have earned just three points - all won by Sutil - since the tyres were changed. Goddard said: "It is a tricky situation. We're still under option - we haven't been told we're not going to be signed. "But if the option lapses and doesn't get taken up, then it is a case of waiting to see if Force India come back to us and negotiate on a new basis. "It's difficult to determine because this last half of the season he [Di Resta] has been adversely affected by the tyres. "He hasn't produced the results he would want to produce, but overall it is the team under-delivering on what it should have delivered." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" after recent back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," he said. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of the injury. He recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. He tweeted a picture of himself in hospital with his thumbs up after the operation. </body>

      <title>Questions remain after Hodgson joke furore</title>
      <description>The public fallout from Roy Hodgson's private joke may be over but the story is not without significance, writes David Bond</description>

      <body>Greg Dyke's unequivocal backing for England manager Roy Hodgson should draw a line under one of football's most bizarre controversies. But it doesn't mean the story is without significance. Telling a joke about a monkey and an astronaut being fired into space may raise questions about Hodgson's sense of humour - not to mention his motivational tactics. But for a man as thoughtful and experienced as Hodgson, it always seemed utterly implausible that he could have been guilty of making such an offensive and potentially racist remark deliberately. The Football Association has now spoken to most of the England players involved in Tuesday night's World Cup qualifying victory over Poland at Wembley and has been reassured none of them took offence at his half-time joke. FA chairman Dyke went even further, describing Hodgson as an honourable man of the highest integrity. That was enough to satisfy anti-racism group Kick it Out  which, having earlier called for a thorough investigation, has issued a statement saying the matter is closed and praising the FA for taking such quick action. That's that then. But the row still tells us two things which are of interest. The first is that football is now so sensitive to racism that even the most innocent - if ill-judged - remark can be seized on and blown up into a major story. Anti-racism campaigners will argue this is a good thing, that it highlights offensive discriminatory attitudes. Just because someone didn't mean to use the word 'monkey' in a racist way, it doesn't mean that person isn't a racist. Well, yes. Up to a point. But in the wake of the John Terry/Anton Ferdinand affair has the game now become too entangled in the moral maze to see a sensible way through this debate? The second, and perhaps more important, point is that one of Hodgson's team decided to leak the story to two newspapers. Whoever did that will have been aware of the potential damage that could have done to Hodgson at a time when the race question is so toxic. For all the supportive tweets of Wayne Rooney  and Andros Townsend  - the player said to be the subject of Hodgson's monkey gaffe - the very fact this story made it into the public domain tells you this England team is not as united and solid as the FA and the manager would have us believe. That perception may be slightly harder for Hodgson to shake off as he prepares for next summer's World Cup in Brazil. </body>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Westminster will "turn the screw" on Scottish spending if people vote against independence, the SNP deputy first minister will tell her party conference. Nicola Sturgeon will claim some MPs are "itching" to cut Holyrood's devolved budget, which is Treasury funded. Her speech in Perth comes ahead of the independence referendum on 18 September next year. She will say independence can build on the progress achieved under devolution. Ms Sturgeon will also appeal to undecided voters ahead of the referendum. She will also pledge to continue a £20m funding package to help alleviate the impact of UK government housing benefit changes, dubbed the bedroom tax by critics, into the year 2014-15. The UK government is cutting housing benefit to those deemed to have spare bedrooms. The SNP has called for the policy to be scrapped and has promised to reverse it if Scotland votes for independence. Ms Sturgeon will tell the conference: "Be under no illusion - if we don't vote Yes, Westminster will turn the screw. "And the limitations of devolution will be exposed for all to see." The SNP deputy leader will point out that, under devolution, the Scottish Parliament has the power to distribute the money but Westminster decides the budget. "And we know this much - there are Westminster MPs in all the UK parties itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending," Ms Sturgeon will tell delegates. "So I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote - they are clear cut and they are real." Ms Sturgeon will argue: "Scotland's social security system will be dismantled. Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat. Scotland's budget will be cut. "Scotland can't afford a No vote. If we are to protect, and build upon, the progress of devolution, then we must vote Yes." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>'Boost family learning in schools'</title>
      <description>Millions of children are being held back by their parents' poor educational attainment, suggests a report.</description>

      <body>Millions of children in England and Wales are held back by their parents' poor basic skills, suggests a report. Involving the whole family in learning can boost educational attainment across generations and should be integral to schools says the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Governments should give family learning more support, the report says. England is "a nation in crisis" as far as skills are concerned said inquiry chairwoman Baroness Howarth. "Adults whose parents have low levels of education are eight times more likely to have poor proficiency in literacy than adults whose parents had higher levels of education," writes Valerie Howarth in her foreword. "Surely it is a moral outrage that a nation such as ours should be in this position." The report draws on a recent OECD study which found that adults in England score among the lowest results in international literacy and numeracy tests when compared with the same age group in other industrialised countries. The OECD study, published earlier in October, found England was 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. The NIACE team also looked at research from national and local government, Ofsted and from educational, family and children's charities. They found "particularly compelling evidence that family language and maths programmes benefit children's skills as well as those of their parents and carers". They also found evidence of wider benefits from improving adults' confidence and self-esteem to reducing ill health, unemployment and re-offending. NIACE urges head teachers to fund family learning through the Pupil Premium which is paid to schools to support the attainment of pupils on free school meals or in care. It also calls for government departments to work together to support family learning and to ensure that there is enough funding to meet demand. David Hughes, chief executive of NIACE said: "Imagine growing up in a home where there are no books, no stories and where your parents don't have the confidence to help you with your homework. "Unfortunately that is a reality for too many children - but this situation can be overcome. "Across the country there are examples of family learning programmes which have transformed the prospects of adults and children. "But these programmes should not be the exception, they need to be the norm in every school and community." A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said the government already supported adults to improve English and maths skills, whether or not they were in work, fully funding GCSE and other qualifications. "We support a wide range of provision so that adults can participate in learning in the way that suits them, including community learning, traditional college courses and online learning." The government also supports family learning through the £210m community learning budget to fund a range of flexible courses, including English and maths tailored to individuals' needs and learning styles, said the spokeswoman. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College Leaders said he broadly welcomed the report. "Parents play a hugely important role in their children's success at school, and schools already do a great deal to engage parents and help them to support their children. "There are a lot of examples of good practice already in schools around the country to draw on. "It is a two-way street however, and while schools can offer opportunities parents have to be willing to engage in them. "Sadly some parents can't or won't support their children's learning and in those cases it is incredibly challenging for schools to create family learning links." </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 gets global release</title>
      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, refuting suggestions that several distinct types were around at the same time, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H.habilis. But many features from the braincase were also unique to H.erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has unveiled the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remains known anywhere in the world. They are also the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group which emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection, it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation which had previously puzzled archaeologists, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. Their comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now." "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H.erectus, H.habilis and H.rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H.erectus, and not present in H.habilis and H.rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils can be "lumped into an evolving H.erectus lineage". "Only H.Erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the country's most common mental health problems.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <body>A two-year-old girl died and a number of children were rescued following a house fire in South Yorkshire. Two fire crews were called to a house in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, just before 20:00 BST on Thursday after a neighbour raised the alarm. The girl was rescued from a bedroom window by firefighters and taken to hospital, but died from her injuries. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire happened in an upstairs bedroom in the house on Don Street. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police added: "A two-year-old girl was taken to hospital where sadly she died from her injuries. "Police believe that no one else was injured during the incident and inquiries are ongoing to establish the exact circumstances around the fire."

      <body>A police officer shot dead when he tackled a gunman in the street near his home has posthumously been given a national bravery award. PC Ian Dibell, 41, was voted as the most courageous officer at the annual Police Bravery Awards, where 13 other officers were also honoured. They included a PC who dived into a quarry to save a boy from drowning. Mr Dibell died while trying to stop Peter Reeve, who had fired at a couple in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. He was selected as the overall winner after officers were nominated for awards by 37 forces across England and Wales. Other winners were: Peter Reeve, 64, had fired shots at his neighbour Trevor Marshall and Mr Marshall's girlfriend, Katarzyna Karolak, and then chased Mr Marshall in his blue Toyota. PC Dibell, a father-of-two, leaned into the car window to try and grab the gun, and a bullet passed through his hand and into his chest, causing fatal injuries. The constable had ran back to his house to get his warrant card when he realised a gunman was on the loose, meaning that technically he was on duty when he died. Mr Reeve took his own life in a churchyard in Writtle, Essex, the next day. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Officers put others' lives before their own. "Sadly, as our winner's story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. "PC Ian Dibell was a valiant team player; his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life - always putting others before himself." Home Secretary Theresa May said: "Ian Dibell's death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. "PC Dibell was off duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm's way. "His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world." </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's First Minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <body>A stone was discovered lodged in County Armagh student Natasha McShane's throat following a random street assault in Chicago, a court has heard. Ms McShane's injuries were so serious that a brain surgeon was immediately told of her admission to hospital. Heriberto Viramontes is accused of the attempted murder of Ms McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in April 2010. Ms McShane has been left with extensive brain injuries after being hit with a baseball bat. She has also struggled with her speech and mobility. The Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago heard evidence on Thursday from the trauma surgeon on duty in the emergency room of Illinois Masonic Hospital when Ms McShane and Ms Jurich were first admitted. Trauma surgeon Dr Marius Katilius said Ms McShane suffered a traumatic brain injury, with blood discovered both inside and outside the skull. Three separate lacerations were discovered. There was blood in her hair, and on her scalp and face. There was "a lot of blood", Dr Katelius said. But he also revealed that following a scan "an opaque structure in the back of the throat" was identified. The medical team "pulled out a stone from the back of the throat". The friends were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago three and a half years ago. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, was a 23-year-old student attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. She had been on an exchange programme, studying urban planning. Her family watched intently as items of her clothing found at the crime scene were pulled from a brown paper evidence bag at the trial. Images of the scene, with Ms McShane's cream-coloured jacket entwined in an olive green sweater beside pools of blood, were also shown in court. A police evidence technician was giving testimony on what she found at the scene. Later, images of Mr Viramontes at a petrol station were shown. Prosecutors allege he tried to use Stacy Jurich's credit card at the station less than half an hour after the two young women were attacked. The trial earlier heard evidence from Ms Jurich, who also suffered serious injuries in the attack. In testimony, Ms Jurich described the moment she was hit. "I heard my head being hit and I felt an excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium," she told the court. "Stupid bitch," her attacker whispered as he snatched her purse and ran off. Ms Jurich said she never saw a face as all her attention was directed towards her friend. "She was not moving on the ground. The blood started coming out of her head," she said. Mr Viramontes, 34, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges linked to his alleged involvement in the attack on 23 April 2010. Apart from Ms Jurich, the trial has also heard testimony from Sheila McShane, Natasha McShane's mother. She described how her daughter remains severely disabled, unable to walk without support, incapable of conversation and barely able to communicate. The jury saw video footage of Ms McShane as she was helped to walk and of her struggling to pick up and drink from a cup of tea. The state's key witness, Marcy Cruz, has pleaded guilty to attempted murder for her role in the attack. The trial of Mr Viramontes is expected to last up to two weeks. </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>A £107m project linking Port Talbot and the docks to the M4 will be officially opened later. It is hoped the three-mile (4.8km) Harbour Way running from junction 38 at Margam will boost the docks area with land being opened up for development. It would also help to cut congestion through the town. The road is one of the largest local council transport projects the Welsh government and European Regional Development Fund has backed. "The completion of Harbour Way is a significant development both for the town of Port Talbot and for the county borough as a whole," Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas said. "By linking key employment sites and opening up land for development along the waterfront, the project will present numerous opportunities for growth and regeneration. "The economic benefits will be far-reaching and indeed this investment is already beginning to pay dividends." The docks area is being transformed into a new knowledge-focused business hub, creating hundreds of skilled jobs. Plans are also in place for further development of the wider Harbourside Park area as the 150-acre site has the capacity to accommodate an additional 75,000 sq ft of space It could lead to a potential investment of over £12m and creation of a further 700 new jobs. Proposals are also in the pipeline for a future residential and leisure development which will sit next to the dockside and river corridor. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will open the road, said: "With Harbour Way now complete, and a further £9.5m of Welsh Government funding for the re-development of Port Talbot Parkway train station, robust infrastructure links will soon be in place to attract further investment to the region to transform the area into a vibrant, well connected place to live, work and do business for many years to come." </body>

      <body>Ethiopian authorities are torturing and mistreating political detainees to extract confessions, Human Rights Watch says. The US-based group says former prisoners at the main detention centre in Addis Ababa described being beaten and kicked during interrogation. It accuses Ethiopia of using anti-terrorism laws to stifle dissent. The government has dismissed the report as biased and lacking credible evidence, according to AFP news agency. The report by HRW says police investigators at Maekelawi prison use illegal interrogation methods, keep inmates in poor detention conditions, and routinely deny them access to a lawyer. Former detainees reported "being held in painful stress positions for hours upon end, hung from the wall by their wrists, often while being beaten", it said. "Ethiopian authorities right in the heart of the capital regularly use abuse to gather information," said Leslie Lefkow, HRW's deputy Africa director. "Beatings, torture, and coerced confessions are no way to deal with journalists or the political opposition." She called on the Ethiopian government to "root out the underlying culture of impunity". But Ethiopian authorities said the report was "extremely biased and ideologically marred". "They haven't come up with any proof," government spokesman Shimeles Kemal told AFP. He criticised the study for basing its findings on testimonials from 35 former inmates and their families, rather than an on-sight investigation. Among the former inmates interviewed was Martin Schibbye, a Swedish journalist convicted of entering the country illegally and supporting a rebel group. Protesters took to the streets in the Ethiopian capital in June to demand the release of jailed journalists and activists. It was the first major demonstration in Addis Ababa since 2005 when hundreds of protesters were killed in violence. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn took office in September 2012 following the death of Meles Zenawi. The Committee to Protect Journalists says the country is close to replacing Eritrea as the African country with the most journalists behind bars. </body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba. The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC. The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordnance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war. There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year. The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said. He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports. This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds. </body>

      <body>Police in India say they have arrested the crew of a US-owned ship accused of illegally entering Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons. MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October by the Indian Coast Guard and is anchored at Tuticorin port in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Its 35-member crew include Indians, Britons, Ukrainians and Estonians. The vessel, owned by a private US-based security firm, is registered in Sierra Leone, officials say. The US embassy in the capital, Delhi, told the BBC they had "no comment" to make on the reports. A police official in Tuticorin said that the crew have been taken to the Motiapuram police station where they are being questioned. Since February last year, India and Italy have been embroiled in a bitter diplomatic row after India arrested two Italian marines for killing two Indian fishermen. The marines - who are being prosecuted in India - were accused of shooting the fishermen off the Kerala coast. They were guarding an Italian oil tanker and said they mistook the fishermen for pirates. In recent years piracy has emerged as a major threat to merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, with Somali pirates hijacking ships and their crews for ransom. But there have been fewer attacks recently, partly because more armed guards are now deployed on board ships. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Grand coalition beckons in Germany</title>

      <body>A grand coalition between Germany's centre-right and centre-left parties has moved a step nearer, nearly a month after the general election. The leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed on formal negotiations. They reached agreement at a third round of exploratory talks in Berlin. CDU leaders seem to have softened their opposition to a national minimum wage, a concession to the SPD. Some of the negotiating will be over who gets which ministry, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from the German capital. If the SPD take charge of finance, the departure of current minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may mean a softening of German economic policy. Forming a new German government can be a long and difficult process but all the signs now point to a grand coalition, our correspondent says. The CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the CSU, fell just short of an outright majority at the polls on 22 September. The CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. Germany is the EU's most populous country and has its biggest economy, making it a pivotal member of the eurozone. "At the end of the third round of exploratory talks we are convinced that we can find sensible solutions for both sides, and most of all for the country, even on disputed questions," SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel said. "The conservatives know... that a nationwide minimum wage of 8.5 euros [£7.2; $11.5]... is one of the central tasks and without this a coalition would not make sense for the SPD. That was no big surprise for the CDU/CSU." CDU secretary general Hermann Groehe said: "We have a joint goal of seeing a sensible minimum wage ruling - I am sure we will find a result but we didn't discuss it today." "In the three exploratory sessions it became clear that with regards to identifying the most pressing political tasks facing Germany over the next four years and how to deal with these, we can find enough common ground to rule this country successfully," he said. The chairman of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, said the paramount issue for him remained "no tax increases and no new debt", according to the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats so the two-term chancellor set about seeking a new partner. Talks with the Greens ended in failure on Wednesday and both of the big parties have ruled out a coalition with the Left Party. As well as the proposed minimum wage, taxation will also be a key issue for the talks. The SPD has not won an election since 2002 and it joined a previous grand coalition under Mrs Merkel in 2005. One final hurdle for the coalition deal will be a vote by SPD party members, promised by the party leadership, on whether to endorse it. </body>

      <title>Nazi Priebke's family seeks his body</title>
      <description>The family of Erich Priebke, a Nazi war criminal who died under house arrest in Rome last week aged 100, demands the return of his body.</description>

      <body>The family of Erich Priebke, a Nazi war criminal who died under house arrest in Rome last week aged 100, has demanded the return of his body. His coffin was seized by the Italian authorities and taken to a military base near Rome after a funeral was halted amid angry protests. Priebke was extradited from Argentina and jailed for life in Italy over the 1944 killing of 335 civilians. Italian media say his body could be kept at the airport for the time being. A funeral in Albano Laziale, south of Rome, was called off on Tuesday following scuffles between protesters and Nazi sympathisers. A senior official in Rome province, Giuseppe Pecoraro, was quoted on Wednesday as saying Italian authorities had "initiated contacts with Germany." Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - has refused his wish to have his body repatriated, to be buried next to his wife. And Priebke's hometown in Germany has also refused to take the body, over fears that any place of burial could become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis. A spokesman for the German foreign ministry said he knew of no laws preventing a German who had died abroad from being buried in Germany, but that it was normally "a matter for the relatives" to decide. Priebke died on Friday, aged 100. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in March 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In a video message taped before he died - and released posthumously by his lawyer - the former SS officer repeated his defence at his trial for war crimes. He said he had received direct orders from Adolf Hitler to carry out the massacre. Priebke was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican had issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, offered to hold the ceremony. As the coffin was taken to the Society's seminary in Albano Laziale on Wednesday, protesters clashed with Nazi sympathisers as his coffin passed. "We had to cancel the funeral yesterday because there was a risk that it could have become a neo-Nazi demonstration," said Mr Pecoraro. </body>

      <body>Four men in Chile have been convicted of murder for torturing and beating to death a young gay man in a Santiago park earlier this year. Judge Juan Carlos Urrutia said the four killers of Daniel Zamudio showed "total disrespect for human life". They broke Mr Zamudio's leg with a heavy stone, beat him up with bottles and carved swastikas into his body with broken glass before walking away. The four are due to be sentenced on 28 October. Patricio Ahumada, Alejandro Angulo, Raul Lopez and Fabian Mora are facing lengthy prison terms. The attack shocked Chile and led Congress in March to approve a law against hate crimes that had been waiting to be voted for seven years. "It is typical of us, Chileans, that an accident has to happen for us to approve a law. My son will not come back, but this case may end up being good for Chile," said Daniel's father, Ivan Zamudio. He was in court to hear the verdict, alongside Daniel's mother, Jacqueline Vera. "Of course I will not forgive them," Ivan Zamudio told El Mercurio newspaper. Daniel Zamudio was attacked on the night of 2 March at the San Borja de Alameda park in the Chilean capital. He was left for dead after an ordeal that lasted for several hours. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and died there 25 days later. Gay activist Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Gay Liberation and Integration Movement, told the Associated Press news agency that he was "satisfied" with the ruling. "There's a before and an after the Zamudio case,'' said Mr Jimenez. </body>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria say they have completed nearly half of their work in the country. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW) said the team was making good progress in its mission to inspect more than than 20 sites. However he said security remained a concern for the 60 inspectors - who have been in Syria since 1 October. "A few" sites remained inaccessible to the team for security reasons, he said. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August. The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict. The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting sites and destroying equipment. Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014. The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC that there had been a number of security incidents over the last few days which had given the inspectors "cause for concern". On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus. Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights. The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative. An international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday. He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN. More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country. Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August. It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian man who used a tractor to break into an Israeli army base in the West Bank has been shot and killed by soldiers, according to a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. The man broke down the gate to the base, between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Military doctors treated the man for his injuries but he died a short time later. There were no Israeli injuries. Palestinian sources told AFP that the dead man was named Yusef Ahmed al-Radaydeh. Israeli media reports say Radaydeh was the brother of Miri al-Radaydeh, who rammed a bus and a police car, injuring two policemen, with a bulldozer before being shot dead, in Jerusalem in 2009. There have been a number of recent deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the West Bank, as well as the shooting of a nine-year-old girl a fortnight ago. The BBC's Kevin Connolly, in Jerusalem, says the violent incidents form an unpromising backdrop to the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, which continue behind closed doors. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Dozens held in Canada shale protest</title>
      <description>A shot is fired, petrol bombs are tossed and police cars torched as at least 40 people are arrested at a shale gas protest in New Brunswick province.</description>

      <body>At least 40 people were arrested after a protest at a shale gas development in the Canadian province of New Brunswick turned violent, say police. A shot was fired, petrol bombs were tossed and police cars torched at the blockade near the town of Rexton. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said arrests were made for firearms violations, threats and intimidation. Protesters have blockaded a staging area where an energy firm stores its equipment since 30 September. Violence erupted as officers moved in to enforce a court injunction won by the company to remove the protesters' highway camp, said police. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officials say at least five of their vehicles were set on fire and destroyed, Molotov cocktails were hurled at officers, and at least one shot was fired by someone who was not a police officer. SWN Resources, owned by Houston-based Southwestern Energy, is exploring the coastal province for shale gas. The reserves are removed from the ground by a controversial practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Opponents of the shale gas sector say drinking water can be polluted during this extraction process. The protesters, including regional First Nations, want SWN's seismic testing to stop. "There have been threats made to employees who were working with a private security firm at the site, as well as firearms offences, incidents of intimidation, mischief and other criminal behaviour," RCMP spokeswoman Constable Jullie Rogers-Marsh said in a statement. "For those reasons, and to ensure public safety, police action was required." Among those arrested on Thursday were members of the Elsipogtog First Nation, including their Chief, Arren Sock, Canadian media reported. Former Elsipogtog chief Susan Levi-Peters told the Globe and Mail newspaper the RCMP vehicles had been set on fire after Mr Sock and several other tribal members were arrested while trying to intervene. A councillor from the Elsipogtog First Nation told the Canadian Press news agency that police had used pepper spray on the protesters. "They sprayed the crowd that was there," Robert Levi said. "The chief was manhandled a little bit and all hell broke loose." He added the protesters would try to stay, despite the injunction. "This is what our people have been fighting for," Mr Levi said. </body>

      <description>A guide to the rebels fighting in Syria</description>

      <body>More than two years after the uprising began in Syria, the opposition remains fractious and deeply divided. The wide variety of political groups, exiled dissidents, grassroots activists and armed militants have been unable to agree on how to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Several groups, however, have tried to form coalitions to unite opposition supporters in Syria and gain international help and recognition. Here is a guide to some of the most prominent alliances. In November 2012, Syrian opposition factions agreed to set up a new and more inclusive leadership council at a meeting in Doha, Qatar. It was hoped the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which includes members from within Syria and abroad, would gain widespread international recognition as the country's sole legitimate representative, become the conduit for all financial and possibly military aid, administer areas controlled by rebel forces, and plan for a post-Assad transition. A blueprint for the National Coalition was outlined in a document published by the veteran dissident Riad Seif, who was subsequently elected one of its two vice-presidents. His proposals were based on the Cairo conference documents agreed in July 2012, which called on revolutionary and political opposition factions to "unite under one leadership framework". Following the Doha meeting, the National Coalition declared on its Facebook page that it was working "to aid and support the revolutionary forces struggling to overthrow the Assad regime and to transition Syria towards a democratic and pluralistic civil state". "The coalition also plays an important role in liaising between the needs of the Syrian people and the international community," it added. According to its website, the National Coalition is dedicated to: The Doha meeting was a response to increasing pressure from the opposition's foreign backers to form a new alliance that superseded the Syrian National Council (SNC), which was widely viewed as ineffective, consumed by infighting and little respected on the ground. Reaction within the SNC was mixed, with some groups concerned that they would only control 22 seats on the leadership council, but the alliance's chairman George Sabra asserted at the time: "This is a serious step against the regime and a serious step towards freedom." The National Coalition also includes members of the Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), a network of grassroots opposition activists, as well as representatives of the local revolutionary councils. It also has the support of the rebel Supreme Military Council (SMC) of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). However, it does not include the National Co-ordination Committee, which represents the internal political opposition groups that reject violence and want to negotiate with the government, and several militant Islamist groups fighting alongside the rebels, including the Nusra Front. International reaction to the National Coalition was generally positive. The six member states of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) were first to recognise it as "the legitimate representative" of the Syrian people, followed by France, the UK, EU and US. In December 2012, 100 countries at the Friends of the Syrian People conference in Marrakech also recognised the coalition. Absent were Russia, China and Iran, which have backed President Assad or blocked action by the UN Security Council. Despite its international support, the National Coalition has suffered many of the problems experienced by the SNC, on which it is still dependent operationally and organisationally, including internal divisions and outside interference. The National Coalition's first president, Sunni cleric Moaz al-Khatib, declared that he was resigning in March 2013, complaining that foreign powers were placing too many conditions on aid to opposition and armed rebel groups, and were trying to manipulate events for their own interests. The resignation came five days after Ghassan Hitto was elected prime minister of the National Coalition's interim government, whose creation Mr Khatib believed was premature. Mr Hitto's candidacy was backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, which dominates the SNC, and the National Coalition's secretary general, Mustafa Sabbagh, a businessman who has strong links to Qatar. The previous month, the SNC had publicly criticised Mr Khatib for saying he would be ready to attend talks with Vice-President Farouq al-Sharaa in a third country if the Syrian government met several conditions, including the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners. The National Coalition has also been unable to assert overall command over Syria's rebel forces, particularly jihadist groups. It has similarly struggled to address the humanitarian crisis, in part because of a lack of funding. An Assistance Co-ordination Unit was set up, but it has struggled to carry out anything on a significant scale. The coalition has also so far failed to administer liberated areas and provide basic services and supplies. In May 2013, a coalition of leading rebel groups issued a joint statement sharply criticising the National Coalition, accusing it of failing to fulfil its duties, and of allowing itself to be taken over by regional and international players. The National Coalition overhauled its leadership at a conference in Istanbul in July 2013, with candidates backed by Saudi Arabia defeating those supported by Qatar in a series of elections. Ahmed Jarba, an influential tribal figure with close ties to Riyadh, was named president after he narrowly defeated Mr Sabbagh in a run-off vote. At the same time, Mr Hitto announced his resignation as prime minister, citing an inability to form an interim government to administer so-called "liberated" zones, co-ordinating the provision basic services and supplies. He was replaced in September by Ahmed Tomeh, a moderate Islamist and former political prisoner who is secretary general of the Damascus Declaration, a coalition of political parties, human rights groups and pro-democracy activists named after a 2005 document that demanded Syria's transformation from a "security state to a political state". In his first speech, Mr Tomeh said he wanted to restore order and security to rebel-held areas, protect people's property, revive the economy and invest in national resources. In September 2013, Mr Jarba parked a storm of protest within the National Coalition's leadership when he told the UN in New York that he would participate in an international conference in Geneva aimed at finding a political solution the conflict in Syria. The US and Russia want the Syrian government and opposition to accept a solution based on the core elements of the final communique issued after the UN-backed Action Group for Syria meeting in June 2012. The communique called for a transitional government that could include officials serving under President Assad and members of the opposition. The Syrian National Council (SNC) is a coalition of opposition groups formed in October 2011 to offer a credible alternative to the Syrian government and serving as a single point of contact for the international community. The current president is George Sabra, a Christian and a veteran leftist dissident. He replaced Abdelbaset Sayda, a Kurd, in November 2012, shortly before the creation of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Mr Sayda and his predecessor, Burhan Ghalioun, were both criticised for failing to reconcile different groups within the opposition and present a united front. The SNC's website says it is committed to the following principles: It has laid out plans for a transitional period which would see it: The new Syria, the SNC states on its website, will be a "democratic, pluralistic, and civil state; a parliamentary republic with sovereignty of the people based on the principles of equal citizenship with separation of powers, smooth transfer of power, the rule of law, and the protection and guarantee of the rights of minorities". The SNC, which is dominated by Syria's majority Sunni Muslim community, has struggled to win over Christians and members of President Assad's Alawite sect, who each make up about 10% of the population and have so far stayed loyal to the government. The council's primacy has also been challenged by the National Co-ordination Committee (NCC), an opposition bloc that still functions within Syria and is led by longstanding dissidents, some of whom are wary of the Islamists within the SNC. Several members of the SNC have also complained about its ineffectual leadership. The SNC has also found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army. However, the two groups have agreed to co-ordinate their operations and the SNC has urged the international community to support the rebels. In November 2012, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the SNC could "no longer be viewed as the visible leader of the opposition" and called for an opposition leadership structure that could "speak to every segment and every geographic part of Syria". Following the creation of the National Coalition, Mr Sabra insisted that the SNC would not be "subsumed under anybody". "The SNC is older than this initiative or any other initiative, and it has a deep political and regional structure," he said. In October 2013, Mr Sabra said the SNC would not attend a meeting in Geneva planned by the US and Russia to find a political solution to the conflict. He also threatened to pull out of the National Coalition. "The Syrian National Council, which is the biggest bloc in the coalition, has taken the firm decision... not to go to Geneva, under the present circumstances," he told the AFP news agency. "This means that we will not stay in the Coalition if it goes." Formed in June 2011, the National Co-ordination Committee (NCC) for Democratic Change is an alliance of 16 left-leaning political parties, three Kurdish political parties, and independent political and youth activists. Its chairman is the veteran left-wing opposition activist Hassan Abdul Azim, leader of the Democratic Arab Socialist Union. His deputy and spokesman abroad is Haytham Manna, a Paris-based academic and rights activist. Unlike the Syrian National Council and the National Coalition, the NCC is open to the idea of a political settlement with the government. Its call for dialogue is conditional on a ceasefire, the withdrawal of the army from towns and cities, and the release of all political detainees. The NCC believes the Free Syrian Army is an essential part of the revolution and plays an important role in protecting society, but rejects calls to arm it or for foreign military intervention. NCC leaders accused the SNC and the National Coalition of being beholden to Turkey and Gulf Arab states that provide shelter, financial support and weapons to rebel groups. It also objects to what it calls the Muslim Brotherhood's domination of the exiled opposition. In turn, the SNC and National Coalition have portrayed NCC leaders as isolated and lacking support among Syrians. In September 2012, the NNC organised the Syrian Salvation Conference, a meeting in Damascus tolerated by the authorities. A statement agreed by participants called for the following: Afterwards, Mr Manna said regime change was inevitable. "This regime is dead in the hearts and minds of all Syrians," he explained. "There must be negotiations on a peaceful transition of power." The Kurdish Supreme Committee was formed in July 2012 by the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the Kurdish National Council (KNC), an alliance of 13 Kurdish parties, under the initiative of the President of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, Massoud Barzani. It was hoped the committee would administer the de facto autonomous Kurdish zone created in north-eastern Syria when government forces withdrew in the summer of 2012. However, the KNC has complained that the PYD has not honoured the power-sharing agreement. The PYD's armed wing, the Popular Protection Units (YPG), has been accused of refusing to share security responsibility in most of the towns and villages in the Kurdish area with the KNC's fighters. Parties in the KNC have also claimed that the Kurdish Supreme Committee has become a tool of the PYD. There has led to disagreement over how Syria's Kurds should be represented at an international peace conference in Geneva proposed by the US and Russia. The US and Turkey reportedly want the KNC to be represented by the main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, which it joined in September 2013. The PYD meanwhile wants Kurds to be represented by the Kurdish Supreme Committee. And Mr Barzani is said to want the KNC to represent itself. </body>

      <title>Who is the true father of football in Brazil?</title>
      <description>The Britons who brought football to Brazil</description>

      <body>Leaning against the wall of a dusty warehouse in Bangu, a bland suburb in western Rio de Janeiro, a huge statue of a thickly-moustachioed footballer prepares to right a terrible historical wrong. With hair slicked back and an arm raised in a moment of goalscoring celebration, the four-and-a-half metre cast bronze effigy of Thomas Donohoe is due to be unveiled in the car park of the local shopping centre next month. In the early 1890s, the site housed a textile factory. Many of its workers were British immigrants, one of whom was Donohoe. This man, his sculptor argues, has been overlooked as the true father of Brazilian football and it's time the world knows about him. Ask almost any Brazilian football fan outside of Bangu who brought football to the country, though, and the answer you're likely to get is Charles Miller. Born in Sao Paulo in 1874, the son of a Scottish railway engineer and his Brazil-born wife, Miller was sent to school in Southampton at the age of 10. As a keen fan of the new sport, the headmaster of Banister Court School encouraged his pupils to play football. Miller proved a natural talent. Two years before he left school, he was already playing centre-forward for the first team. Later, he was picked for St Mary's FC (now Southampton) and played a few games for the Corinthians. Ten years after arriving in England, he returned to Brazil. In his luggage, famously, he packed two footballs and a book containing the 13 rules of association football. The match he organised, on 14 April 1895, between the workers of the Sao Paulo Railway and those of the Gas Company, all of whom were British, is widely considered the first football match to have been played in Brazil. A few years later, Miller established the country's first football league, cementing his status as the founder of the game in Brazil. But the residents of Bangu hope their new monument will convince football fans visiting Rio during next year's World Cup that it is really Donohoe who deserves the credit. "Thomas Donohoe was the first to bring a football to Brazil, eight months before Charles Miller," Clecio Regis, the statue's designer, tells me in his workshop. "They [Miller's supporters] accept this, but they say it was just for a kickabout. There's no way Donohoe would have settled for just a kickabout for eight months." The excitable 53-year old, a set designer, sculptor and owner of the second-largest Bangu Atletico Clube flag in existence, says the only reason Miller is credited with the discovery of the game is because he brought it to Sao Paulo. "People always forget about Bangu, but the first football in the country was the one brought here, by Thomas Donohoe," he adds. Thomas Donohoe was born in Busby, a mill town six miles outside Glasgow, in 1863. That same year, the world's first Football Association  was founded in London. Aged 10, Donohoe followed his father into the print works, working as a dyer. And about the same time as he joined the company, he set up its first football team. Few records of his sporting feats survive though, with the exception of a match report from 1887 praising his performance for Busby in an otherwise humiliating 5-2 defeat by Cartvale. Marriage, and children, followed. Struggling with a growing family and a meagre income, Donohoe sought opportunities outside Scotland. With British technical skills in demand as Latin America attempted to industrialise, he found a job as a master dyer at a new textile factory in Brazil. In May 1894, he set sail from Southampton to Rio, leaving behind his wife and two young sons. Little documentary evidence has been produced to flesh out the details of Donohoe's life in Latin America, particularly relating to his first football games. But Carlos Molinari, the official historian of Bangu Atletico Clube, is trying to put that right. Bangu consisted of little more than a single street and the textile factory when Donohoe arrived. According to Molinari, the Scot soon settled among the small British expat community in the village. Though happy with his job, and his new friends, he pined for his old hobby, finding Bangu's Sunday pastimes of cycling or music no match for football. He was horrified to discover there were no teams in the neighbourhood, no equipment to be bought in the shops, and no knowledge of the game whatsoever among the locals. So Donohoe wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to join him, and to bring a football, as well as their children. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. According to Molinari, it was a six-a-side match between British workers, and took place eight months before Charles Miller's game. Few supporters of Charles Miller's claim to be the father of Brazilian football dispute the accuracy of Molinari's work. They do, however, question Donohoe's significance. "Nobody is saying that no-one kicked a ball in Brazil before 1895," says John Mills, Miller's biographer. "But an organised game is an organised game." Of Miller's famed luggage, Mills argues the rulebook mattered more than the footballs. "The Sao Paulo Railway versus Gas Company match was the first recorded 11-a-side match using association football rules in Brazil." Mills shows me a letter written to a Brazilian sports journalist in 1937 by Hans Nobling, a German sportsman credited with helping to promote the game in the early stages of its development. "When I arrived in Sao Paulo, on 15 May 1897, football was unheard of in Sao Paulo and most likely throughout Brazil. […] To my mind, the honour of having brought to Sao Paulo the first ball for a game of football falls, without doubt, to Charles Miller," he wrote. Antonio Carlos Napoleao, a football historian I meet in the trophy-stuffed offices of the Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol, agrees with Mills. "I think this idea that there was some guy from Scotland who played a few games here in Rio de Janeiro is very vague," he says. "That's playing football, not implanting football. They are two completely different things. Charles Miller implanted football in the country: he created a club and helped to launch the first official championship." Back in Bangu, now an unfashionable suburb with a second division club, such arguments cut little ice. Molinari argues the town would have boasted the first football club in the country had it not been for the intervention of one of the managers of the textile factory, who believed all games, including football, would lead to degeneracy among his workers. By the time the factory owners relented, in 1904, the Sao Paulo league was already in its third season. But some Banguenses, while still asserting Donohoe's contribution has been overlooked, acknowledge a degree of local pride colours their reasoning. Benevenuto Rovere, 67, is one of the founders of the Gremio Literario Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos, Bangu's local museum. Inside the cavernous room are replicas of Donohoe's football and boots. On its walls are hundreds of black and white photos chronicling the town's history, including an image of Bangu Atletico Clube's line-up from 1905, which features Francisco Carregal, the first black man to play for a Brazilian football club. After he shows me around the museum, I ask Rovere if he would still support Donohoe's claim if he were not from Bangu. After a long pause, he answers: "It's in the blood, isn't it? I wouldn't swap my neighbourhood for any other. It's where I was born and it's where I've lived all my life. And every day I am more convinced that the birthplace of football is here in Bangu." </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>'Everyone knew' about Savile - Ex-Pc</title>
      <description>Former officer on his encounters with Jimmy Savile</description>

      <body>A former police officer has spoken about some of his colleagues' attitude to Jimmy Savile in the 1960s - saying that everyone in the force knew "Jimmy liked them young". The ex-officer, who wants to remain anonymous, was with Leeds City Police in the 1960s. He used to patrol areas of the city where Savile was well known. The entertainer was in his 30s at the time and was a familiar sight in the areas of Roundhay and Headingley. It was one incident in 1965 the former policeman remembers well. Late one night, just before midnight, he noticed Jimmy Savile's Rolls Royce parked in a secluded spot on the edge of Roundhay Park. "As I went past I saw the interior lights were on," he said. "I went past but stopped and went back - I thought someone had nicked it. "He was sat in the driver's seat and was talking to a young lady in the passenger seat. She looked like Twiggy - I couldn't tell her age, perhaps 15 or 16. "I said, 'What's the matter, Jimmy - what are you doing up here?' "He said, 'Yeah, we're fine, aren't we?' And she smiled. Then he said, 'We're waiting for 12 o'clock, son.' "Why?" I asked. 'Because it's her birthday tomorrow, she's 16.' And he winked at me. "I asked the girl, 'Are you ok?' "She smiled - there was no impression she was being forced to be there. I think she wanted me to get lost as well. "Jimmy then said, 'Now get back on your bike before you lose your job.'" The officer then went on his way. He said: "If there was any impression that she was 10 or 11 I wouldn't have gone anywhere. There was no doubt whatsoever that she knew what was going to happen. "Savile gave me the impression he was justifying himself and knew what people suspected him of - he was waiting until it was legal. His attitude was, 'I'm not doing it now but in ten minutes there isn't a thing you can do about it.'" Later on in the shift he mentioned the meeting to his sergeant, who said to him: "Was she upset?" When he replied, "No", he claims the senior officer added: "We know Jimmy likes them young, he's got friends in high places." The former officer said today that the attitudes of the time were "different" and accepts that such actions today would be unthinkable. "Leeds City Police were absolutely not covering up Jimmy Savile as a paedophile," he said. "They turned a blind eye to 15-year-olds but never considered that as paedophilia. "If he was caught with an 11-year-old that would have been a different matter. You can't blame Leeds City Police for what everyone in the country was doing. I'm not saying that's right, but it was the attitude at the time." The officer later left the police force but believes that attitude of the police towards Savile lasted for years afterwards. The Leeds City force merged into the West Yorkshire Constabulary in 1974. He also believes that police may have informally talked to Savile about the age of his girlfriends in the 1960s. "Nearly everybody knew that his girlfriends wouldn't be much over 17 - I think he knew he was being watched," the former officer said. "Perhaps he was warned beforehand that he was treading on dangerous ground." He believes any new inquiry into West Yorkshire Police will not change anything. Yesterday, the independent Police Complaints Commission announced an investigation into a former officer who called colleagues in Surrey on Savile's behalf in 2009, saying he knew the former DJ personally and passing on a phone number. A recent West Yorkshire Police inquiry concluded that friendships Savile had with officers had not protected him from arrest or prosecution. But a recent review of that inquiry found it did not have the look or feel of an independent report. Today West Yorkshire Police appealed for the police officer we spoke to today to contact them. The force released a statement that said: "West Yorkshire Police are appealing for a man who spoke to the media yesterday in relation to the Jimmy Savile case to get in touch." But the former officer, who spoke on the Jeremy Vine Show yesterday, is adamant there was no special protection for Savile. "There was no conspiracy, it wasn't covered up," he said. "They all knew Jimmy Savile liked them young - and we're not talking 12 - we're talking 15. It was the culture." Jimmy Savile, a former TV presenter and radio DJ who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of victims during his career. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Friday's papers take aim at British Gas over the energy company's 9% hike in prices. The Daily Mirror sets the tone with a picture of boss Chris Weston alongside the headline: "I'm putting your gas bill up by 10% - now where's my two million pound bonus?" Sun readers should leave what the paper calls "Brutish Gas" and switch to other firms. It's launched a campaign against what it calls "hated" green taxes which it blames for adding to energy bills. "Heat or eat", the Daily Express warns as it predicts soaring bills will lead to a "devastating increase" in winder deaths. The Daily Mail reports on a warning from the Royal Academy of Engineering that the lights could go out as early as next year. And the Guardian highlights a public relations disaster for British Gas after it tried to quell criticism on social media. It says almost 16,000 mostly vitriolic tweets "rained down" on the company in just a few hours. The Times assesses George Osborne's announcement that the Chinese can take a stake in the UK's nuclear power plans. It could pose important security issues, the paper says. In his first interview since being sacked last week, Lib Dem former minister Jeremy Browne tells the Times he is puzzled as to why he lost his job. But it is the plight of a Lib Dem still with a ministerial job who was forced to stand at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday which reaches a number of Friday's papers. The Daily Mail says the Commons is obviously no "hotbed of chivalry" as none of the dozens of MPs sitting nearby saw fit to offer pregnant Jo Swinson a seat. A Daily Mirror editorial argues giving up a seat for a pregnant lady isn't sexism but simple good manners. Millions of people could be spared the agony of crippling back pain by seeking early treatment, according to the front page of the Daily Express. Several papers report criticism of a school in Leeds which apparently allowed pupils as young as eleven to smoke in the playground. The Daily Telegraph says that cigarettes have been confiscated as the children arrive each day, but handed back at break times. There's support for the England manager, Roy Hodgson, after his "feed the monkey" comment during a team talk. The Telegraph calls him "one of the most civilised people in football", while the Independent asks: "Why all the fuss?" Meanwhile children's groups and internet safety experts have rounded on Facebook, according to the Times, after it announced plans which will allow millions of teenage users to open up their profiles to strangers. And finally, a number of papers report findings from scientists who say that from the age of 18 months, children can tell when we are faking our emotions. "Smile and the world smiles with you, cry and you cry alone," says the Times. "However, smile when you feel like crying, and your toddler is going to be pretty puzzled." </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up?</title>
      <description>Is China's economic growth as breakneck as figures suggest?</description>

      <body>China's economy sped up in the July-to-September quarter to expand at 7.8% year-on-year, according to official gross domestic product (GDP) figures. That's faster than the previous quarter when GDP grew at 7.5% and the January-to March quarter's 7.7% expansion. Unless the fourth quarter tanks, it means that the Chinese government will hit its growth target of 7.5% for the year, as the growth rate for the first nine months came in at 7.7%. If they were to hit the target, it would be the slowest growth rate since 1999 which was the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese government is aiming for a slower and better balanced economy that can grow more sustainably. But, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are more questions than ever over the reliability of Chinese figures. It's not just GDP, but the other data releases today have also come in largely as expected: industrial production rising 10.2% from a year earlier in September, retail sales up 13.3%, fixed asset investment grew by 20.2%. I've written about the trouble with Chinese figures before, particularly when it comes to GDP. But, how good are the three indicators reportedly espoused by China's premier Li Keqiang as being more reliable? They are gaining prominence as they are being used by banks such as Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as an alternative index for Chinese growth. The first indicator is electricity usage. The amount of power used by households and firms is a good gauge of consumption and one that is hard to hide. One problem is that China subsidizes some prices so it's somewhat mis-measured, but it's a decent economic indicator. Credit Suisse estimates it's around 9% annualised growth. The amount of cargo freight is the second measure. Instead of factories saying how much they've produced (recall that they have been chastised for faking figures in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces this year), it's more reliable to take a look ourselves. Railway cargo volume shows how much has been manufactured and is being moved around the country. But it is an under-measurement of economic activity because it only captures around 40% of GDP - the biggest part of the Chinese economy now is services. Cargo freight volumes are growing at around 21%. The final gauge is bank loans. How much households and firms borrow over the medium and long-term reflects the amount of demand in the economy for investment. This is why it's a good indicator of economic activity. But if this is used unproductively to build ghost cities, then it's a different way of over-stating growth. These loans are growing at about 5%. It's not just Western banks that look at this data. I understand from Chinese government researchers that a rule of thumb is if the Li Keqiang indicators show about 10-11% growth, then real GDP growth would be around 7-8%. In which case, today's GDP figure would be consistent with the Li Keqiang index and show that the Chinese economy is speeding up. But, there are others who are convinced that Chinese officials won't miss (bar an external crisis that can be blamed) a growth target, so none of these government-produced figures are very reliable. Plus, none of these indicators, even viewed together, would be able to give a complete picture. One thing is clear is that this debate is sure to run and run. For the Chinese leadership who are keen to show that they're cracking down on fraudulent data and increasing confidence in the economy, it would help if they could indicate why they are well-equipped to produce GDP figures faster than any other major economy in the world. Doing so in just over 2 weeks is a fairly remarkable feat for any country, much less one with 1.3 billion people. That's a lot of data to process in a rather short period of time. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. Britain needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>
      <date>1382063225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70545000/jpg/_70545028_optheatre.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24571012</url>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's First Minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <body>Westminster will "turn the screw" on Scottish spending if people vote against independence, the SNP deputy first minister will tell her party conference. Nicola Sturgeon will claim some MPs are "itching" to cut Holyrood's devolved budget, which is Treasury funded. Her speech in Perth comes ahead of the independence referendum on 18 September next year. She will say independence can build on the progress achieved under devolution. Ms Sturgeon will also appeal to undecided voters ahead of the referendum. She will also pledge to continue a £20m funding package to help alleviate the impact of UK government housing benefit changes, dubbed the bedroom tax by critics, into the year 2014-15. The UK government is cutting housing benefit to those deemed to have spare bedrooms. The SNP has called for the policy to be scrapped and has promised to reverse it if Scotland votes for independence. Ms Sturgeon will tell the conference: "Be under no illusion - if we don't vote Yes, Westminster will turn the screw. "And the limitations of devolution will be exposed for all to see." The SNP deputy leader will point out that, under devolution, the Scottish Parliament has the power to distribute the money but Westminster decides the budget. "And we know this much - there are Westminster MPs in all the UK parties itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending," Ms Sturgeon will tell delegates. "So I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote - they are clear cut and they are real." Ms Sturgeon will argue: "Scotland's social security system will be dismantled. Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat. Scotland's budget will be cut. "Scotland can't afford a No vote. If we are to protect, and build upon, the progress of devolution, then we must vote Yes." </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in place in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural towns in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those towns. The Scottish towns are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." The UK most now secure approval for the expanded scheme from the EC, which is expected to announce its decision next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander added. The 10 towns selected for the application have higher pump prices than in locations that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <body>A reward of up to £10,000 is being offered for information leading to the conviction of thieves who steal metal from electricity substations. Scottish Power Energy Networks' new campaign, Copped It, highlights the consequences of thefts in and around substations and power lines. The campaign has been launched in response to a surge in thefts and attempted thefts of metal. There have been 1,435 incidents at the firm's substations since January 2011. According to the company, this has resulted in 140,000 homes put at increased risk of damage, 50,000 homes in Glasgow losing power for 30 minutes in November 2011 and the death of a 43-year-old man in July this year after an attempted theft from a substation in Lanarkshire. A Perthshire man and his pregnant wife also had a lucky escape this week when a surge caused by thieves stealing live overhead cables set their house on fire. Scottish Power said that about 11,000 hours had been spent on repairs and reinforcements. It said a maximum reward of £10,000 would be given to any member of the public whose information leads to the conviction of people who steal metal from the company. Chief executive Frank Mitchell said: "The worrying reality of this kind of criminal behaviour is the serious impact it can have on local communities. "As well as continuing to increase our own security and working closely with the police, we want to raise awareness of the threats posed by these kinds of thefts and we want to encourage people in communities to report any suspicious behaviour they see beside our power lines and substations. "We are happy to pay rewards for information that leads to criminal convictions, and we want to work closely with communities to help catch the criminals responsible for this dangerous activity." Any suspicious activity can be reported to Scottish Power via its 24-hour response line on 08452 727 999. Scottish Power Energy Networks is the licensed electricity distributor for central and southern Scotland and for Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and North Shropshire, with 30,000 substations, 40,000km overhead lines and 70,000km underground cables. </body>

      <body>Forgotten Gaelic place names in Lochaber that recall tales of murder and an epic boar hunt have been recorded in a new guide. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said many of the names no longer appear on modern maps. Some of stories behind them are also appearing in print for the first time, the public body added. The booklet, Gaelic in the Landscape: The Rough Bounds of Lochaber, was launched at the Royal National Mod. The celebration of Gaelic language and culture is taking place in Paisley. SNH and Ainmean-Aite na h-Alba co-ordinated the project to create the guide. Among the place names is Sgurr Tuirce, near Loch Shiel, which means boar peak. In the new guide, the name is linked to an Ossianic story about an ancient hunt across Scotland for a huge tusked boar. Near Loch Morar, Na Cailleachan Buidhe - meaning the yellow women - is said to recall the story of two women who were murdered in the 1500s before their bodies were buried in peat. </body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices. The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK. Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%. The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland. Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers. An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase. "Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible. "Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency." </body>

      <title>Man admits biting cousin's ear</title>
      <description>A 34-year-old man from Dundee admits biting off part of his cousin's ear in a row over a grave plot.</description>

      <body>A man has admitted biting off part of his cousin's ear in a row over a grave plot. Andrew Montgomery, 34, from Dundee, carried out the assault before chasing Dean Montgomery, who was clutching his severed lobe, down the street. The assault left the victim needing extensive reconstructive surgery to create a new ear as the detached part could not be saved. Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday. The court heard how the assault came after a family dispute over a grave plot - with various exchanges between family members over two weeks before the attack. Andrew Montgomery then approached his cousin on Dundee's Dens Road, on 30 July last year, and a fight broke out. Both men fell to the ground, with Dean Montgomery becoming aware that his accused was biting his ear. Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair said: "The accused had a grip of his ear in his teeth and the complainer was afraid to pull away, in case his ear became detached. "He was then aware of part of his ear falling to the ground. "He picked it up at this time and had it in his hand." Dean Montgomery then managed to get to his feet and ran back down Dens Road - towards Alexander Street. Miss Sinclair added: "The accused caught up with the complainer and knocked him to the ground and repeatedly punched him on the head and body." Members of the public who witnessed the attack then called police - with Andrew Montgomery making off in an orange Vauxhall Corsa. His cousin was taken to Dundee's Ninewells Hospital where he needed 24 stitches to his ear. The amputated part of the lobe was not deemed fit for re-attachment. Dean Montgomery then had to go through lengthy and painful reconstructive surgery to give him a new ear. The court was told that two rib cartilages were harvested from his chest and carved into the shape of the missing part of his ear. They were then covered with a skin flap taken from behind his other ear. Miss Sinclair submitted a victim impact statement to the court detailing the effect of the attack on Dean Montgomery. Andrew Montgomery pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge of assaulting his cousin, to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Jack Brown, defending, said there had been a long-standing family dispute and that Dean Montgomery "was not the shrinking violet in the impact statement". Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday for a full plea in mitigation to be heard from Andrew Montgomery's lawyer. </body>

      <title>Dentist suspended for nine months</title>
      <description>The owner of a chain of dental clinics is suspended for allowing 18 unqualified members of staff to give children unnecessary treatment.</description>

      <body>A dental tycoon who allowed unqualified staff to give children unnecessary treatment at clinics across the west of Scotland has been suspended. George Campbell, owner of the All 1 Smile chain of clinics, also repeatedly failed to check the qualifications of staff who carried out orthodontic work. He has practices in Glasgow, East Kilbride, Greenock, Cumbernauld, Hamilton and Kilmarnock. Campbell has been suspended for nine months following a tribunal. The General Dental Council (GDC) heard how Campbell had mistakenly extracted patients' healthy teeth and referred children for hospital surgery which they did not need. He was referred to the GDC in September 2011 following a series of complaints that were made about the treatment of 30 patients spanning over a decade. The tribunal was told that between July 2001 and August 2011, Campbell repeatedly referred children for unnecessary extraction and surgery. They also heard how he had failed to ensure staff were fully qualified, with up to 18 employees carrying out treatment before they had completed their orthodontic training. It was reported an employee had even provided orthodontic treatment without having any dental qualifications or training. Stewart Goulding, chair of the conduct and competence committee, who made the decision said: "There are a number of grave failings in his clinical practice highlighted by the findings. "There are, particularly in the areas of radiography, treatment planning and treatment undertaken, and his employment of unregistered and unqualified staff. "Taking these wide-ranging failings together with his departures from specific guidance and standards within the profession, the committee had little difficulty in determining that the facts found proved amounted to serious misconduct" Giving evidence, Campbell had told the GDC there was a lack of guidance from the regulatory body when it came to his newly-qualified staff. He said: "There was no real guidance or supervision so we always aimed to provide the training and guidance ourselves. "I was supervising new staff on a daily basis and with any queries on the supervision or tasks we would phone the GDC to check." Campbell had denied the bulk of the allegations against him at the hearing in London. A series of charges were not proven including a failure to ensure patient numbers could be adequately served at his clinics. </body>

      <body>A charity worker who stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable pensioners has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. Philip Muirhead, 36, from Aberdeen, went to Cuba and also bought a car using some of the money, after taking and cashing cheques from two people. He was working as an advocate at a support centre at Royal Cornhill Hospital. Muirhead admitted 10 charges of theft committed between 2008 and 2010 when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court The court heard he considered suicide after being caught. Defence agent Gregor Kelly said: "Mr Muirhead succumbed to temptation to dig himself out of financial difficulties. "There was a window of opportunity and he took that and he will regret it for the rest of his life. "His financial position unravelled during the time near the end of the offences although he admits that he did use some of the money for the car and the holiday." Mr Kelly added: "He panicked with regard to attending court. "He simply couldn't face up to reality - he had a clearly thought out a suicide plan and made his way to the Forth Road Bridge." Sheriff William Summers said: "You were employed in a position of trust and you abused that trust - that was shameless and despicable. "All the money you have stolen has been squandered. "These were not sophisticated thefts but they were carried out in an utterly deceitful and heartless way." </body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no". The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away. He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny". On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country". Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future. He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no. "And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country. "We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities. "They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract." The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland". He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector. Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself." At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant. He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. </body>

      <body>A watchdog has completed its investigation into a police force's handling of a complaint from the family of a man who died 16 years ago. Kevin McLeod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. His death was treated as accidental. His family claim officers were instructed by the procurator fiscal to treat it as potential murder. It is understood Police Scotland has now been asked to examine whether this was the case. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) confirmed it had completed its review of the family's complaint. A spokesperson said the commissioner had made a single recommendation. Police Scotland said it was considering the action recommended. Northern Constabulary, which was merged with other forces to form Police Scotland, treated Mr McLeod's death as accidental. His family, however, have consistently criticised the force over its investigation. Their most recent complaint centres on the claim that the procurator fiscal instructed the force to carry out a murder investigation. In 2007, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland (PCCS) said Northern Constabulary behaved with "institutional arrogance" in the way it handled earlier complaints from Mr McLeod's parents, Hugh and June McLeod. It ordered the then chief constable, Ian Latimer, to apologise in person to his relatives, which the senior officer did. Following the latest development, a spokeswoman for the PIRC said: "The commissioner's review of this case is now complete and a report has been sent to the family and Police Scotland. "The commissioner made a single recommendation in his report, which is for Police Scotland to implement." A police spokesperson said: "We have received the report from the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner and are currently considering the recommendation that has been made." </body>

      <body>A man accused of causing a car crash in November 2011 which led to his father's death is too ill to stand trial. James Mowat, 47, of Croy, near Inverness, has missed a number of court dates because he is still in hospital. It is alleged that as a result of the smash his father, also called James, was fatally injured. At the High Court in Edinburgh, prosecutor Adrian Cottam said the Crown was deserting the case pro loco et tempore. This means the charges have been dropped but the case could still be brought back to court in the future. Mr Mowat suffered a stroke following the crash. He had been facing a charge of driving carelessly while unfit through drink or drugs, or an alternative charge which alleged his alcohol level was three and a half times the legal limit when he was driving carelessly. The indictment alleged that as a result of the crash on the B9091 Croy to Nairn road, near Clephanton, his father was fatally injured. Mr Mowat's car was said to have failed to take a bend, left the roadway and hit an embankment and a tree. He had also faced charges of failing to report the accident and possessing cannabis. </body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE. It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month. Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK. Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test. "In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote. Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE. Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle. The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal. Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided. The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal. He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation. </body>

      <body>Leading philanthropists from across the world have been recognised for their work at a special ceremony in the Scottish Parliament. Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter was among six people to receive the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. The medal is awarded biannually to those who use their private wealth and business acumen for public good. They were granted the award for their support for education, science, entrepreneurship and the arts. Sir Tom is only the second Scot to receive the award, after Kwik-Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer. Other recipients of the medal this year included the founder of the second largest telecoms business in Russia, Dr Dmitry Zimin. American hedge fund manager Dr James Harris Simons - along with his wife, economist Dr Marilyn Simons - also received medals, as did Dame Janet Wolfson de Botton on behalf of the Wolfson family, which set up the Wolfson Foundation. The foundation was named after Glasgow-born business leader and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson, who died in 1991. The daughter of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, accepted a medal on her mother's behalf. The ceremony has only been held outside the United States once before - also at the Scottish Parliament in 2005. In that same year, Sir Tom Hunter was knighted for services to entrepreneurship and philanthropy. The son of an Ayrshire shop owner, he started his first business selling sports shoes from the back of a van with a £5,000 loan from his father. He later built his Sports Division business into Europe's largest independent sports retailer and eventually sold it in 1998 for £290m. Sir Tom and his wife Lady Marion went on to establish The Hunter Foundation (THF). Previous medal recipients include the Rockefeller Family, the Gates Family, the Sainsbury Family, the Cadbury Family, George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Holyrood's Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "Earlier this week, the parliament opened an exhibition exploring the legacy of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy over the past 100 years. "Today, we welcomed modern philanthropists to our chamber, people who have followed in Carnegie's footsteps and used their wealth to make a positive difference to society. "I am sure Carnegie would have enjoyed today's ceremony and I hope the stories of the medallists will help inspire the next generation of philanthropists." This year's ceremony also marked the centennial of the establishment of the Carnegie UK Trust. The trust is named after Dunfermline-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie, whose family emigrated to the US from a life of poverty in Scotland in 1848. He made his fortune in steel, becoming the world's richest man, and eventually gave away billions of pounds to fund a network of global foundations. </body>

      <body>A couple who were caught with more than £100,000 worth of Class A drugs in their Midlothian home have been jailed. Lee Middlemass, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months and Jo-Anna Wallace, 21, for two years at the High Court in Edinburgh. The pair had previously pled guilty to offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. A search of their home in Dalkeith in October 2012 found 1.3 kilos of cocaine, £7,195 in cash, a hydraulic press and other drug-making equipment. Wallace, 21, had asked the judge not to be separated from her baby daughter when, at an earlier hearing, she admitted being concerned in the supply of the drug. Unusually, judge Lord Pentland allowed her and partner Middlemass to remain on bail pending sentence, so they could spend more time with their three-month-old However, when the pair appeared for sentence the judge dismissed a plea to allow Wallace to do community service, saying the court would be failing in its duty. He said: "What sort of message would that send to society and, in particular, to persons further up the drug chain who might be tempted to prey on vulnerable individuals?" Sentencing the couple, Lord Pentland said the motive had been money. He said: "Neither of you seen to have taken into account the enormous damage Class A drugs cause in communities throughout the country." </body>

      <body>A mother-of-five who admitted storing drugs in her home to help her teenage son, after he was threatened in prison, has been jailed. The drugs were uncovered during a raid at Karen McCarthy's home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, on 1 November last year. Amphetamine and a class A drug similar to a substance known as STP were found, with a street value totalling £92,500. The 45-year-old was jailed for 18 months at the High Court in Edinburgh. The judge heard how police had obtained a warrant to search McCarthy's home in Mountblow, after a tip-off. The search uncovered bags and plastic containers of white paste and white powder among the family foodstuffs in the kitchen freezer. McCarthy, who pled guilty to being concerned in the supply of the drugs, had worked with a voluntary group trying to help people beat addiction. Judge Lord Burns said: "I appreciate you did not know exactly what it was." He added: "There is a strong public interest in dealing with people who join in the chain of supply, as you did, by providing a safe house." </body>

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <body>Highland Council has formally submitted a planning application for its proposed Inverness West Link. Councillors on the local authority will be asked to consider the plans for the new road, which could cost up to £34m to construct. The council says the new road is needed to ease travel across Inverness and free up congested city centre streets. There has been local opposition to the preferred route because it would involve construction on green spaces. Highland Council has proposed creating new sports pitches and facilities as part of the West Link project. These could cost up to £9.5m to build. </body>

      <body>Highland Council is running a survey of businesses and organisations affected by closures of the A890 Stromeferry bypass in Wester Ross. The eight mile (12km) stretch of road has been repeatedly shut by landslides. The council is examining several possible solutions. These include a tunnel, a bridge or for traffic to use a nearby railway when not in use. The survey seeks information on the reasons why companies and organisations rely on the bypass. Questions include how many employees use it to get to work and how important it is to firms for delivering goods. The bypass on the A890 in Wester Ross has been closed by large landslides in the last two years. The A890 helps to connect Lochcarron to Plockton, with its high school, and also to Kyle. The road links up from the A896, the main road through Lochcarron, and runs down the side of Loch Carron. When the bypass is closed, drivers face having to take a 140-mile (225km) diversion, instead of the usual 18 miles (29km) from Lochcarron to Plockton. It was shut for three days in December last year when almost 20 tonnes of debris came down. In December 2011, the bypass was shut by a landslip which involved 100 tonnes of rock. This left it blocked for four months and sparked a Highland Council investigation into how to prevent further disruption. A small car ferry, a pleasure cruiser and train services were all utilised in an effort to ease the travel headache for locals. Rubber mats were also later laid on a railway running alongside the bypass so road traffic could use the track. Highland Council is not expected to make a decision on a preferred permanent solution until next summer. </body>

      <body>A Scottish island has been twinned with a video game's virtual world. Skye's twinning with the fictional isles of Skylands has been done to promote a new version of Skylanders. VisitScotland said the move would also boost tourism to Skye, and was the first time a video game "world" had been twinned with a real place. Highland Council is also involved in the twinning, which involves game characters appearing on Skye's official tourism website. A large scale version of one of the game's characters was also taken to Skye for publicity photographs. Skye has other links with the entertainment industry. The island's landscape has been used for scenes in the films Prometheus, Stardust, Highlander and Flash Gordon. </body>

      <body>Oil and Gas UK has commissioned new research into the economic contribution of the industry. The industry body has appointed EY to assess the billions of pounds the supply chain generates annually. Oil and Gas UK said the study would use data from more 1,000 companies, with the results expected to be released in March next year. UK Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said gaining further insight was important. He said: "The UK's oil and gas supply chain is highly robust with the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth over the coming decades. "Gaining even further insight into its strengths and capabilities will only help to support the ongoing work of our joint oil and gas industrial strategy to create new jobs, encourage investment and increase exports." Oil and Gas UK's business development director Stephen Marcos Jones said: "We have a world-leading global supply chain based here in the UK which we believe contributes £5-6bn every year to the Exchequer and exports £7bn worth of goods and services. "It is important we continue to make the UK an attractive place for these companies to stay." A recent report said a severe shortage in qualified staff will push the average wage in the oil and gas industry up by 15% this year to £73,600. The forecast came in a survey of more than 2,200 oil and gas companies by recruitment firm Oilandgaspeople.com. </body>

      <body>Police have released the descriptions of three men and a van they hope to trace in connection a missing sculpture that is said to be worth £3m. The bronze piece by Henry Moore which was stolen from the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead. Police said a blue Ford Transit-style van and its three occupants were seen at the park on two occasions before the artwork was taken last week. The men have been described as being in their 20s or 30s. Police Scotland said they were of average height and build. One had ginger, shaven hair and was wearing a red or orange waterproof jacket. The men had a collie-type dog and the van was described as being of an unusual shade of blue. Police said the men may have had legitimate business in the area and have appealed for them to contact the force. Det Insp Colin Burnie, the officer leading the enquiry, said Police Scotland was "delighted" with the public response to the investigation. He added: "We now require further help to identify this blue van and occupants and would again ask the public to call us if they have any information which may help us." The missing sculpture, called the Standing Figure, is believed to be worth up to £3m according to police. It was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park. The remaining major pieces at the site have since been moved into secure storage for their safety. Standing Figure is among a number of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years. Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46. </body>

      <body>Renewable energy developer RES UK has welcomed a decision by the Scottish government to clear its plans for a wind farm in the Scottish Borders. RES had lodged an appeal over its 15-turbine Penmanshiel wind farm plans after a dispute with the local council. The company claimed Scottish Borders Council failed to decide on the firm's application within required timescales. The project was cleared after RES cut the number of turbines to 14 on visual impact grounds. Last year, Scottish Borders Council said it would "vigorously defend" the RES appeal. The company maintained the project had been in planning for nearly a year without a decision being made by the council. However, a council spokesman said at the time that RES had not responded to requests to adjust its plans. RES said on Wednesday that Penmanshiel would make an important contribution to Scotland's energy targets and deliver significant benefits to the local community. Project manager Ruth Elder said: "We are delighted with the positive decision made by the Scottish government today and we are pleased that through the removal of one turbine the project has been allowed to proceed." RES said the local community at Penmanshiel would receive a benefits package of £5,000 per installed megawatt once the wind farm is operational. </body>

      <title>UK inmates lose right to vote ruling</title>
      <description>Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch lose their UK Supreme Court battle over the right to vote while in jail.</description>

      <body>The Supreme Court has dismissed appeals from two prisoners over the right to vote under European Union rules. Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch had argued that EU law gave them a right to vote - even though they cannot under British law. Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that the ruling was "a great victory for common sense". The European Court of Human Rights has previously told the UK to end the blanket ban on prisoners voting. Parliament is considering legislation, but has not yet decided what to do. Following the Supreme Court's judgement, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said: "Critically it ruled that EU law did not provide an individual right to vote, paralleling that recognised by the ECHR. Eligibility under EU law is a matter for national parliaments." Convicted prisoners in the UK are banned from voting on the basis that they have forfeited that right by breaking the law and going to jail. Successive governments have wanted to maintain that position but the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said a blanket ban on prisoners voting was disproportionate. Peter Chester raped and strangled his niece in Blackpool in 1977 and was jailed for life for her murder. He has served his minimum term but the Parole Board has refused to release him because it says he is too dangerous. In 2008, he tried to join the electoral roll so that he could vote in the elections for the European Parliament. The Ministry of Justice said he could not until the law was changed. In the second case, George McGeoch, serving life in a Scottish prison, argued that EU law allowed him to vote in local and European elections. Although the ECHR has already told the UK to change the law, these two cases focused on whether prisoners as EU citizens have a right to vote even if Westminster says differently. Last year, the government conceded that it would have to change the law to allow some prisoners to vote. Ministers have published a draft bill which is being considered by Parliament. The proposals include limiting the vote to inmates who are serving either less than six months or four years. A further 2,352 inmates have tried to bring voting cases to the European Court of Human Rights. Those applications are adjourned while judges wait to see what Westminster does. </body>

      <body>An island beer maker has announced plans to open a brewery, hotel and visitor centre on the mainland. Isle of Arran Brewery said the centre in the village of St Fillans, Perthshire, will cost at least £250,000 to develop and lead to about 20 jobs. The former Drummond Hotel will be converted into three restaurants, two bars and a shop, with hotel accommodation for up to 30 guests. The brewery aims to attract 30,000 visitors to the site in the first year. It wants the new facilities to complement its existing visitor centre in Brodick, Arran, which draws about 20,000 visitors annually. The new site is due to open at the start of next summer. Isle of Arran Brewery managing director Gerald Michaluk said: "The St Fillans site offers the brewery the chance to diversify and expand, producing a range of fresh and exciting brews in a new region of Scotland. "The new premises will be situated on a stunning site overlooking Loch Earn and we hope to add to the magic of St Fillans with some island charm." The St Fillans project is being part-financed by VisitScotland and Bank of Scotland to promote tourism before major events next year such as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup. Last year, the brewery bought Rosebank Distillery near Falkirk as part of expansion plans. The deeds of the site say it cannot be used for distilling until 2017 when a "micro-distillery" could be opened. </body>

      <body>A man who committed sexual offences on children for 22 years has been sent to prison. Paul Angus, 57, was found guilty of 15 charges including three rapes, attempted rape, sexual assault and indecency. The judge ordered that he serve at least five and a half years in prison before he can ask for parole. He will remain under supervision and on the sex offenders register for the remainder of his life. During an earlier three-week trial Angus claimed he was innocent and that his accusers were conspiring against him. Eight girls ranging from eight to 16 were attacked at various locations in and around Dundee. They were assaulted between December 1988 and May 2010. None of the victims can be named for their protection. The court had heard how three of the girls were plied with drink before Angus made them perform sex acts. He was also found guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice by contacting one of his rape victims on 14 April last year by text message and attempting to persuade her not to contact police. Lord Burns said: "You used emotional blackmail which is truly despicable." After the trial last December, Lord Burns ordered in-depth reports to pave the way for a life sentence. An earlier hearing had to be cancelled at the last minute because Angus was taken to hospital complaining of chest pains. The judge noted that Angus had "groomed" the eight girls and appeared to have no appreciation of the effects his abuse had on them. He said: "You took advantage of them for your own depraved purposes." Lord Burns warned Angus that he would only be released when it is considered he no longer poses a risk. </body>

      <body>Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond will publicly debate with key figures in the No to independence campaign, his deputy Nicola Sturgeon has said. But she added that the SNP leader remained keen to go head-to-head with Prime Minister David Cameron. Ms Sturgeon made her comments on the BBC's Daily Politics show. Mr Cameron dismissed suggestions that he should take part in a televised debate with Mr Salmond in the run up to the referendum next year. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, 2014, when they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil asked Ms Sturgeon if she could give a commitment that Mr Salmond would debate with new Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, and head of Better Together, Alistair Darling. She replied: "I am sure that between now and the referendum Alex Salmond will debate with both of those people and many others, making the positive case for independence. There is no issue or question about that." But Ms Sturgeon added: "The real question is why will David Cameron not agree to debate with Alex Salmond? What is he running scared of? That is the unanswered question. "I've already debated with Alistair Darling. I've debated with Michael Moore. Alex Salmond will debate with lots of people between now and the referendum, but the first and foremost point here is that there should be that debate between the first minister and the prime minister." Better Together claimed Ms Sturgeon's comments were a "U-turn". A spokesman said: "It is good news that Nicola Sturgeon has finally confirmed that Alex Salmond has backed down and will now have a live TV debate with Alistair Darling. Now that both sides have agreed, it's time for the campaigns to get on and make this happen." Mr Cameron made his position clear when he appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show last month. He told the broadcaster: "Alex Salmond wants the question to be about anything other than the question. "So he would like the debate to be the SNP versus the Tory Party or Scotland versus England. It's not - it's a debate between Scots. "What it should be is between Alistair Darling, leader of the No campaign, and Alex Salmond, leader of the Yes campaign." </body>

      <body>The impact of changes to housing benefit has been raised by First Minister Alex Salmond in talks with Prime Minister David Cameron. The leaders were meeting at the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in Downing Street, involving devolved administrations and the UK government. Mr Salmond said the "insanity" of the so-called bedroom tax was evident. New Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said it was clear there was a difference of views. The JMC meeting comes on the eve of the SNP's conference in Perth and less than a year before the referendum on Scottish independence. Mr Salmond raised the issue of the removal of the spare room subsidy, described by critics as the ''bedroom tax'', as well as youth unemployment and lottery funding. The meeting, chaired by the prime minister, also focused on the economy and illegal immigration as well as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup, both being held in Scotland next year. Ahead of the talks, the first minister told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "There's a subject on the agenda called hot political issues and I can't think of anything hotter than the bedroom tax at the present moment. "The insanity of the charge is becoming ever clearer by the day." Mr Salmond called for a review of the policy's impact and an indication of whether discretionary housing payments to mitigate its impact would continue next year. After the talks he said no agreement was reached on the reforms, adding: "The way to agree on the 'bedroom tax' is to get it reversed." Mr Carmichael, who also attended, had urged Mr Salmond not to take a negative approach and said he should be prepared to listen and learn. Mr Salmond said Lib Dem and Labour criticism of his views on the benefit changes was an example of other parties working in co-ordination with the Conservatives. Mr Carmichael told BBC Scotland that Mr Salmond must accept that there would be real problems in an independent Scotland running welfare reform and benefit payments. He said: "The question of a review is one where in fact I think we are rather ahead of the curve because the deputy prime minister announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the government itself is having a review of this, and indeed we review all policies as they go along." The Scottish secretary said difficult decisions had to be made to cut the deficit but if it was shown there were difficulties being caused by housing benefit changes the government would deal with them. Mr Carmichael said: "We always knew that this was going to be a very difficult policy to implement and we can see the obvious difficulties that come with it - we're not blind to that, I see it in my own constituency - that's why we've already put an enormous amount of money directly into local authorities so they can protect those that are going to be most vulnerable to the changes." Meanwhile, Labour's shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran, accused the Scottish government of "grandstanding". She said: "Prices are rising faster than wages, energy bills are still going up and the bedroom tax is continuing to hit people across the country. "This is a rare opportunity to hammer out a plan to get to grips with this cost-of-living crisis. "Instead of coming to London to tell David Cameron to bin the bedroom tax, Alex Salmond should be laying out a plan to stop it hitting Scots." Also attending the meeting were the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, leaders of the Welsh and Northern Irish governments, Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop and Scottish Youth Employment Minister Angela Constance. </body>

      <body>Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead has asked the UK government to allow him to lead negotiations for Britain at crucial European quota talks, BBC Scotland has learned. It comes after last week's reshuffle by David Cameron saw George Eustice replace Richard Benyon as the UK fisheries minister. Mr Lochhead said it would be unfair to ask the new minister to head the talks. Allowable days at sea and mackerel quotas are among the main issues. Mr Lochhead said: "I will be doing everything I can to secure a favourable outcome for Scotland's fishermen." The EU fisheries council talks begin in Luxembourg on Thursday. Meanwhile, Scottish fishing industry leaders have welcomed "productive" talks with Mr Eustice and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael. The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) said the talks with the politicians covered a range of issues. These included the mackerel dispute with Iceland and the Faroe Islands. SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The meeting with Mr Eustice provided an early opportunity to brief the minister on the importance of the autumn negotiation period for the pelagic fleet. "We stressed to Mr Eustice that newly-released mackerel scientific advice demonstrated that the stock was in robust health and that the UK should not feel pressurised into securing a deal which jeopardised the future of the UK pelagic fleet. " He added: "We also had a very useful briefing session with Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael, who expressed his full support for our industry." Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, replaced Michael Moore as secretary of state for Scotland in the recent reshuffle. </body>

      <body>Business confidence is rising across all sectors in Scotland but the economic recovery remains frail, a survey of firms has suggested. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found manufacturing orders rose in the third quarter at their highest rate for six years. Manufacturers and retailers also forecast a rise in profitability in the first half of next year. But SCC warned it was "by no means yet certain" the recovery can be sustained. On Wednesday, figures released by the Scottish government indicated Scotland's economy grew by 0.6% between April and June this year - the fourth consecutive quarter of growth north of the border. Labour market statistics also showed employment in Scotland at its highest level for five years. SCC's latest business survey, which is conducted in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, found employment trends improving in all main sectors in the third quarter of 2013. Manufacturing orders also rose at their highest rate since the third quarter of 2007. Construction orders on balance declined, but levels remained higher than during the same period a year ago. The survey also suggested the long-term decline in retail sales had ended. The good summer boosted visitors to Scottish hotels, with more than half of businesses reporting a rise in guests. SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest survey showed "welcome signs of growth" for Scotland's economy. She said: "Compared to a year ago, business confidence has increased and all business trends in all sectors are stronger, showing positive steps towards sustained economic growth. "There are encouraging signs of increased consumer activity, with improving retail sales and stronger tourism trends. This is good news for Scotland and for Scotland's businesses. "The manufacturing sector has seen orders rise at the highest rate since 2007, construction respondents reported a rise in investment intentions and the long-term decline in retail sales ended, with retailers reporting increased optimism for the first time since 2006." She added: "However, economic vulnerability remains. "Much depends on continuing positive trends in our major export markets and on speedy resolution of any remaining US fiscal issues. "Importantly, prices and wages remain disconnected and so household incomes continue to be squeezed. "This creates risk in reliance on a consumer-driven economy, which is why government rhetoric about investment and sustainability needs to become a reality to enable continued growth and confidence." </body>

      <body>Oil firm Cairn Energy has announced it is to start a year-long "high impact" exploration programme, with drilling to begin soon in Morocco. The company said the move would offer shareholders "exposure to material growth potential". A number of possible follow-up exploration prospects have also been mapped. Cairn said that a decision would be made soon on whether to drill the Pitu prospect off Greenland next year. The Edinburgh-based group's drilling programme in Greenland has so far been unsuccessful and has been strongly criticised by environmentalists. In a statement to the stock exchange, Cairn said that it remained in a "strong financial position ready to enter an intense operational period on the exploration front". Chief executive Simon Thomson said: "Cairn continues to follow its policy of maintaining appropriate balance sheet strength as it progresses its exploration and development programmes." The company also announced it would begin a share buy back programme of up to $300m (£186m). Cairn got shareholder approval for the move earlier in the year. </body>

      <body>Rangers fans will welcome the departure of Craig Mather as chief executive, Supporters' Association general secretary Drew Roberton believes. Mather resigned two days after losing a court case that forced the League One club to postpone their annual meeting. "The fans were unhappy at the way the club was going and the financial performance," said Roberton. "And they weren't convinced the current board, including Craig Mather, were the right people to take the club forward." Rangers were forced to delay their AGM because they had failed to include on the agenda a request by shareholders for the election of four new board members. And the departure of Mather, who had been in charge for six months, along with non-executive director Bryan Smart, was announced to the stock exchange. "In light of the court judgement, he has clearly made a serious error of judgement as far as the AGM notices go and his position, I would say, was untenable and he's fallen on his own sword," Roberton suggested to BBC Scotland. The association general secretary thought that change was needed in light of a loss of £14m reported for the last financial year. "It had to happen because clearly things did not appear to be going very well financially at the club judging from the accounts that have just been raised and everyone believed that change was needed," said Roberton. "The club, for whatever reason, tried to block that change. "I do believe that the requisitioners do have the best interests of Rangers at heart and I'm sure they'll appoint a top-quality chief executive to run the club. "I've spoken to Paul Murray and Malcolm Murray on previous occasions and I have no doubt whatsoever that they have the best interests of Rangers Football Club at heart." Former Rangers director Dave King, the Scottish businessman who has settled a tax dispute in South Africa, had been suggested as a future chairman after talks with Mather. "I think there might be a bit of a mixed reaction with Dave King," suggested Roberton. "But, on the other hand, Dave King is certainly in a position to put investment into the club and people would hope that, should Dave King return in any capacity to the board, he would perhaps make a significant investment in the club." Following the financial meltdown that led to Rangers playing in Division Three last season and boardroom battles that also resulted in the departure of Mather's predecessor, Charles Green, Roberton hopes the Glasgow club can now find some stability. Bus tycoon James Easdale and finance director Brian Stockbridge remain on the Rangers International Football Club plc board, while Easdale's brother, Sandy, is also on the football club board. "We would just like to see it all settle down and start making on-the-field headlines instead of off-the-field headlines and see the club on a stable financial footing for the future," added Roberton. "I just really hope that, between the Easdales and Mr Stockbridge, they arrange the AGM as soon as is reasonably practical and we can move on" </body>

      <body>Celtic captain Scott Brown has been given a three-game European ban by Uefa following his red card in the Champions League defeat by Barcelona. Referee Stephane Lannoy dismissed Brown after he appeared to aim a kick at Barca forward Neymar. The ban would make the 28-year-old unavailable for both games against Ajax and the visit of AC Milan. "The club finds this to be excessive and they will be appealing against the decision," said Celtic in a statement. The next Champions League game Brown would be available for is the final Group H fixture against Barcelona at the Nou Camp. Celtic are bottom of the group having lost their opening two matches, while Ajax have one point going into their trip to Glasgow on Tuesday. Following the 1-0 home loss to Barca, Brown admitted he had "made a mistake" but felt the red card was "harsh". </body>

      <body>Glasgow City set up a Champions League tie against Arsenal with a 3-1 second-leg victory over Standard Liege for a 5-3 Round of 32 aggregate win. The home side took the lead through an Aline Zeler own goal before Denise O'Sullivan gave City a two-goal lead in the opening half-hour. Right winger Sarah Crilly added a third midway through the second half, before Tessa Wullaert scored a consolation. Arsenal beat Kazakhstan's CSHVSM-Kairat 11-1 for an 18-2 aggregate victory. Glasgow head coach Eddie Woleckie Black said: "This is as good a result as we've had in Europe. "The pressure was on us here, but after criticising the team for some aspects of their play last week I couldn't fault them tonight. "It took a lot of effort, but we've beaten a very good side and it was a thoroughly deserved win." Glasgow were in control from the start on their rain-drenched Petershill Park pitch and never looked back after taking a 15th-minute lead. Zeler turned the ball into her own net under pressure from Suzanne Mulvey as the striker chased a pass from midfielder O'Sullivan. The Belgian side hit back, with midfielder Sanne Schoenmaker driving a 15-yard shot wide of the post. But Glasgow went close again when midfielder Jess Fishlock fired in an 18-yard shot that was well saved by the diving Sabrina Broos. And the Women's Scottish Premier League champions doubled their lead on the half-hour mark as O'Sullivan volleyed home a cross from Crilly. It was almost 3-0 two minutes into the second half as Crilly sent a looping volley against the crossbar. But the winger was not to be denied in the 56th minute when she bagged the third goal with a superb 18-yard drive that flew into the roof of the net. That left the visitors a massive task to claw their way back into the game, but they made a valiant attempt. Left winger Julie Biesman forced a goal-line save from keeper Lee Alexander, who then had to dive to turn aside a good effort from Wullaert. Alexander did well to deny Wullaert again as the striker broke clear six minutes from time. But Wullaert finally found the net two minutes into stoppage time, shooting home from left back Faustine Cartegnie's low cross. For Arsenal, striker Danielle Carter scored four goals and midfielder Kim Little hit a hat-trick - including two penalties. Their onslaught came in the second half after leading 4-0 at the break through Carter, Ellen White, Little's first penalty and a Jordan Nobbs effort. Seven goals then followed in a convincing 31 minutes after the break. Carter and Little completed their tallies, while Nobbs struck a second and substitute Caroline Weir also got her name on the scoresheet. Midfielder Makhliyo Sarikova scored Kairat's consolation goal a minute into stoppage time. Arsenal boss Shelley Kerr said of the meeting with Glasgow: "Since the draw was made everybody in Scotland seems to have been desperate for this game to happen. "Glasgow have proved what a good side they are for a long time now and I'm not surprised they've made it though to the last 16. "It will be a tough tie for us, but we'll prepare for it as professionally as we would to face any team and we'll focus on ourselves. "The fact that I'm Scottish is not an issue - my responsibility is to manage Arsenal and I'll be trying to manage them into the last eight." </body>

      <description>Mark Dodson says Scottish Rugby is "not frightened" of the prospect of planned changes to European club competition.</description>

      <body>Chief executive Mark Dodson insists Scottish Rugby is "not frightened of meritocracy" amid plans to change how clubs qualify for European competition. The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next year, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with the Heineken Cup. But Dodson insists strong performances in the Pro12 are key to Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh's participation. "We believe if Edinburgh finished 11th last year, they should not be involved in the Heineken Cup," said Dodson. "When I first came here, I said I would focus on professional rugby as well as the international team. "The targets we have been setting for both Glasgow and Edinburgh are for them both to be in the top four of the RaboDirect Pro12. "So for us to say we are against meritocracy would be crazy because our ambitions are to be challenging in the Rabo every year." English and French clubs object to the current Heineken Cup qualification criteria and the way revenue is shared. As things stand, Glasgow and Edinburgh are automatically entered to the competition. The new tournament could include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's endorsement. "What we would like to do is ensure that there is a rounded and fair solution," added Dodson. "We are prepared to look at meritocracy and some of the other tweaks that might need to be made to allow that to happen. "But don't let anyone be under any doubt, we are working very hard to make this work. "There has to be give and take. It can't be all take or it won't work. "We understand, we need to modernise and I have some sympathy with the English clubs' predicament. But they are working with a mix of models. "It doesn't work only the way the French and English leagues work. The Celtic and Italian clubs are run in a fundamentally different way." </body>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. And they're very supportive of one another. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <body>Here in Perth for the annual conference of the SNP, their last such event before next September's referendum. Historic. Challenging. But some things never change - and so it was that the opening event was, as is customary, a challenge to the agenda from Gerry Fisher, a splendid constitutionalist within a party which is not short of such beings. Gerry has been protesting about conference arrangements for as long as I have been attending as a journalist. (I would call him a veteran but he would have something else to say about me.) Today his appeal to reinstate a motion (drafted by Fisher, G.) was dismissed on the grounds that he was merely restating existing party policy. Exit Gerry, sad but unbowed. Conference immediately moved to debate a resolution which restated party policy as being in favour of independence. Indeed, there was so little prospect of dissent that one speaker, Linda Fabiani, voiced her pleasure at the absence of stress. It was, you will be astonished to learn, passed nem con. Still, mustn't grumble (although Gerry Fisher would undoubtedly challenge me on that one.) Unanimity is not unknown at other conferences. Plus, and this may astonish you further, the Nationalists actually believe in independence. They do not propose the repeal of the Union out of badness. Little wonder, then, that they seek to project their key objective at their own conference. However, there was time today for other topics. There was a debate on developing a sensible work/life balance. From the chair, Derek Mackay chirpily reminded delegates that such luxury would only apply to them after they had pounded the streets incessantly up to and including 18 September next year. As if to remind them of the challenge, a clock above the platform ticked steadily down to the opening of referendum polling. Alex Salmond needs no such reminder, on either count. As First Minister, his work/life balance is frequently disturbed. And so it was today that, straight after opening conference, he headed back to Edinburgh to hold talks on the challenge facing the Grangemouth petrochemical complex. Mr Salmond reflected the grave nature of that challenge in his opening remarks. He had, he said, studiously avoided the temptation of making political capital from a dispute whose origins lie, at least in part, in internal Labour Party deliberations. Further, he stressed that government could not, either in Edinburgh or London, will a settlement nor order a deal. That was down to the unions and the company. But he noted that, in separate interviews on different channels, both sides had voiced hope that Grangemouth had a strong future. In essence, he argued, let it be. Then Mr Salmond turned to independence. As anticipated, his argument operated on distinct levels. The audience in the hall needed no convincing (see above.) And so his message was aimed at the sceptical outside the hall, around Scotland. He made a series of basic points. That there was a "natural majority" for independence on the basis that most Scots appeared to favour the transfer to Holyrood of most key powers. That this natural majority was depressed (arithmetically) by disquiet over the economy, stirred, he suggested, by the advocates of Union. That Nationalists could steadily counter this disquiet. That Scotland faced a choice of two futures: full self-government or continued partial rule from Westminster whereby policies such as the so-called bedroom tax would be intrinsic. It was a taster of arguments to come at this conference, from Nicola Sturgeon tomorrow and from Mr Salmond in his main address on Saturday. </body>

      <description>A look at the history of the Grangemouth complex</description>

      <body>The bitter industrial dispute which has broken out at Grangemouth has placed a spotlight on the giant refinery and petrochemicals complex. So what is the history behind the site, who runs it now and what operations are carried out there? When did the site start up? In 1924, BP opened a refinery on the Firth of Forth, in part because of its transport links and the availability of local labour skilled in shale oil refining. From the 1950s, BP's operations there grew to meet growing demand for both petrochemicals and fuels. The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil in the 1970s brought further business to the site. The refinery's feedstock is now mainly supplied by the neighbouring BP-operated Kinneil oil and gas processing plant. Some oil is imported to the site via pipeline from the deepwater Finnart Ocean Terminal, located about 60 miles west of Grangemouth. Who owns the complex? The petrochemicals part of the 1,700-acre site is run by Switzerland-based speciality chemicals and oil product manufacturer Ineos. It owns more than 50 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries across the world. In late 2005 Ineos bought BP's olefins and derivatives business, taking over the Grangemouth complex in the process. The crude oil refinery - the only one in Scotland - is now owned by Petroineos, a joint venture which was formed between Ineos and PetroChina International (London) Company in 2011. What is produced at Grangemouth? The Grangemouth refinery processes around 210,000 barrels of crude oil per day, producing more than nine million litres of clean fuels per day. The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides fuel to Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland. The refinery and chemical plants form Ineos' largest production centre. The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year. These are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging. What major equipment is there at the complex? At the heart of the petrochemicals site are two ethylene crackers - G4 and KG - which produce the feed materials used by other chemicals plants. The two units have an ethylene production capacity of one million tonnes per year between them. </body>

      <title>Tough tactics at Grangemouth</title>
      <description>What's behind the bitter dispute at Grangemouth?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24560317</url>

      <body>The industrial dispute at Grangemouth has the feel of the 1980s about it; robust confrontation, provocation and bitter mutual denunciations. The energy complex's operator, Ineos, has made clear it can be ruthless, as it did earlier this month when it simply and permanently closed down a fairly new chemicals plant in Hull. It was keen that workers at Grangemouth got that message. They surely got the message this week. Their strike threat is bringing about a total shutdown, rather than the "hot stand-by" the union says would be adequate: "It's shut down and it remains shut". Put on the back foot, the hardball tactics of Ineos forced Unite the union into cancelling its strike plan, without any achievements and with no agreement on any of the issues in dispute. They next face a demand for concessions on pay, conditions, pensions and possibly job losses. They get this weekend to think about it, with a reply expected by Monday. And on Tuesday, the owners of Grangemouth decide if they've got the cost-cutting they demand. By owners, that mainly means Jim Ratcliffe, who built up Ineos in only 15 years to become a global chemicals giant, fuelled by mind-boggling amounts of debt. His bondholders will take part in deliberations too. The stakes are high. There's a look of real alarm from government ministers in London and Edinburgh at the implications of the shut-down of the twin refinery and petro-chemical plant. They are keen not to repeat the fuel disruption which led to panic buying and shortages in the past. So you're told not to worry about petrol and diesel supplies. There are stockpiles, and arrangements have been made to ship in fuel for transfer to road tankers. But there's a longer-term and more fundamental risk to the Scottish economy from the Ineos shut-down. And it's an imminent risk. While Ineos threatened the petro-chemical plant may shut before the end of 2017, no-one from Ineos was able to tell me on Wednesday that it will definitely open again after shareholders review their position next week. The refinery is in a more secure position, even though we've been told the closure of the petro-chemical plant, which uses the gas by-products from the refining process, would make the finances of the refinery more difficult. And the relative security of the refinery is not just because it appears to be in a relatively strong financial position: it's also that it's half-owned by Petro-China. We've yet to hear what they think about this very un-Chinese dispute, but that humongous corporation (it's market value is nearly £150bn) will surely have an interest in the shareholder meeting next Tuesday. The further risk to the economy is that a huge complex of offshore oil and gas production platforms pump their output down the pipeline to Grangemouth. That pipe is, in turn, operated by steam and cooling gases from Grangemouth. Alex Salmond said on Wednesday that supply is secure, which should mean the pipeline stays open. But if this shut-down drags on, for how much longer before the constraints of crude storage require production to halt upstream? And as it's focussing minds of ministers in two governments, here's another question to which I still await an answer: do they have any legal powers over the owners of such a vital strategic asset, if that owner is determined to close it down? Much of this dispute pivots on the claim by Ineos that it's losing around £10m per month, and nearly £600m over the past four years. It says it's in a "distressed" condition. Wrong, says Unite. The union asked a tax accountant to test out the assertion. Richard Murphy, a campaigner on tax reform and an adviser to the Trades Union Congress, has concluded that Ineos is in rather rude health. He suggests they've thrown a number of exceptional items at last year's accounts, which mean it doesn't look good. And he argues that a £117m allowance for deferred tax implies that there's around £500m of profit still to be made. But he also admits that Ineos' accounts are hard to find, let alone to fathom. There are dozens of firms registered under the Ineos brand, and a spokesman confirms that there's no straight-forward way of assessing the Grangemouth plant, amid numerous intra-company sales and loans. It doesn't help with clarity that the parent company moved out of Britain to Switzerland. That was its response when the UK Treasury turned down a request to defer a VAT bill when Ineos was in financial difficulties with the onset of the downturn. Ineos stresses that its auditors, PwC, have confirmed the extent of its problems, though it's yet to open its books to confirm the small glimpse that press release shows us. It seems odd, at least, that capital expenditure is counted as part of the loss that Ineos says it's making. In any case, the complexities of its finances matter rather less when the Ineos management has ensured that its workforce is focussed rather more intently on the survival of the plant, and of their jobs, past this weekend. </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>The BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme is appealing for members of the public to join an audience for its next debate on issues associated with the independence referendum. The programme makers want to hear what you think about Higher and Further Education in Scotland. They also want to know your opinions on the way universities and colleges operate, their funding, admissions policy and research resourcing. Do you think independence would be good or bad for post-school education in Scotland? Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector? If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below. The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30. Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views. To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" </body>

      <body>Alex Salmond has called for concessions from both management and unions in a bid to break the deadlock in the industrial disputes over the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant, says the Scotsman. The Daily Record also leads with the refinery dispute. The paper says workers have claimed oil giants at Grangemouth will make half a billion profit by 2017 - and have not paid UK tax for five years. Households in the north and north east will bare the brunt of Scottish gas price rises, according to the Press and Journal. David Cameron's pledge to make the UK one of the world's leading five business-friendly countries is in crisis, according to top-level civil service warnings, reports the Herald. The new Queensferry Crossing will be toll free, says the Courier. The paper says Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney will make the announcement later.

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "Our coverage checker is regulated by Ofcom and offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile operators. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>Underwater wi-fi given test run</title>
      <description>A team from Buffalo, New York, has been testing "underwater wi-fi" as it attempts to create an internet for the oceans.</description>

      <body>Researchers have tested an "underwater wi-fi" network in a lake in an attempt to make a "deep-sea internet". The team, from the University of Buffalo, New York, said the technology could help detect tsunamis, offering more reliable warning systems. They aim to create an agreed standard for underwater communications, to make interaction and data-sharing easier. Unlike normal wi-fi, which uses radio waves, the submerged network technology utilises sound waves. Radio waves are able to penetrate water, but with severely limited range and stability. Sound waves provide a better option - as demonstrated by many aquatic species such as whales and dolphins. Wireless communication underwater has been possible for some time, but the problem lies in getting separate systems used by different organisations to communicate with each other. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for instance, uses acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to buoys on the surface. However due to infrastructure differences, this data cannot be shared quickly with other information gathered by the US Navy. Therefore, the University of Buffalo team is attempting to create a shared standard. "A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time," said Tommaso Melodia, lead researcher. "Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives." The test was carried out at Lake Erie, near Buffalo. The research team dropped two 40lb (18kg) sensors into the water - and were then able to use a laptop to transmit information to them. In future, the team hopes the sensors could be used to help detect and solve environmental issues. With a shared standard, different research groups with varied equipment could potentially combine their data gathering efforts with greater ease, and in real-time. More details of the team's work will be presented at a conference for underwater networking to be held in Taiwan next month. </body>

      <title>Dexter malware strikes South Africa</title>
      <description>Malware designed to steal information from payment cards' magnetic strips strikes thousands of restaurants and retailers in South Africa.</description>

      <body>South Africa has been hit by one of the biggest cyber-fraud attacks in its history, according to the body that oversees local financial transactions. The payment card systems of thousands of shops, restaurants and hotels had been compromised, said the Payment Association of South Africa (Pasa). Losses were thought to be in the "tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions of rands", it said. It added the attackers had used a new variant of the malware known as Dexter. Ten million rand is worth £626,000 or just over $1m. Dexter gets its name from a string of code found in one of its files, which may refer to the US television show that followed the exploits of a serial killer. The Dexter code was linked to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the UK, US and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year. It skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,. Pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in Europe, but added it was not sure from which countries. "It's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses," Walter Volker, Pasa's chief executive, told the BBC. "We started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-January, February. We initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company. "Eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. Very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software." Mr Volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen Pin codes or CVV payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops. "Normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up Dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got," Mr Volker added. "It seems like it was a European-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but Interpol and Europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators." KFC fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the Bloomberg news agency. "We take this extremely seriously," Yum Brands said. "Our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal." Bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, Famous Brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed. However, Pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack. "In terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way," said Mr Volker. "The South African card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. It's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts. "If that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank." </body>

      <title>Snapchat hack secretly saves images</title>
      <description>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created, raising privacy fears.</description>

      <body>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created. Snapchat rose to popularity as an app that allows people to share pictures, safe in the knowledge they would delete themselves after being viewed. However, Snaphack circumvents this system, allowing recipients to pass on or upload images to social media. Snapchat could not be reached for comment on the app. However, the company's terms of service state that it does not allow the development of "any third-party applications that interact with user content or the services without our prior written consent". Snaphack was made by UK-based developer Darren Jones, who told the BBC: "Snapchat has not been in touch and I imagine it's only a matter of time until they request that my app is removed. "But my app just proves and informs people that these apps exist and people need to be careful." Previous methods of saving or retrieving Snapchat images and video have been publicised. In August, another app known as Snap Save was distributed - but users found that if they saved an image it would inform the sender they had done so. Snaphack gives no such warning. The app is available through Apple's App Store. Apple is yet to comment on the issue. Although it is not marketed as such by the company, Snapchat has gained a reputation as a system for so-called "sexting", due to the app's countdown timer that renders the picture inaccessible after a few seconds. First released in 2011, the app has rapidly grown to be worth - according to one estimate - around $860m (£540m), but like many social media start-ups it has yet to turn a profit. Concerns over privacy have followed the app's success closely. In May, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission. "Snapchat is the app that promises to delete photos but it doesn't," said Marc Rotenberg, EPIC's executive director. "We have no problem with apps that make photos vanish. But they should work as promised, and if they don't the Federal Trade Commission should investigate." In response, Snapchat brushed off the claims - acknowledging that an image could easily be saved by simply taking a screenshot on the phone, or by photographing the screen with another device. Since then the company has regularly used its blog to outline its practices for storing images. Other image retrieval methods relied on special software to reverse-engineer Snapchat's system - but Snaphack's simplicity and automation raised serious issues, argued one expert. "It absolutely undermines the security of Snapchat," said Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at Trend Micro. "If the fact that your photo has a limited lifetime is the one thing that gives you the comfort to send it, this news should put you off." Developer Mr Jones told the BBC he was introduced to Snapchat just three weeks ago - and said he designed the app to raise awareness that such sharing is possible. "For months people have been sending private images without knowing it has been possible to do this kind of thing with them with other apps," he told the BBC.

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

His comments follow a cyber-attack on the Belgian port of Antwerp, in which drugs traffickers are alleged to have recruited hackers to breach IT systems which controlled the movement and location of containers. Prosecutors say the cyber-attack allowed them to steal entire containers in which cocaine and heroin had been hidden.

      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 year's ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <description>Rise of the unmanned-aircraft hobbyists</description>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>
      <date>1381823426</date>

      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives. "I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. "I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. "We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there." This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with." So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. "I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries." They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. "Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. "I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time." Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. "It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says. "I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. "However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall." Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS." "When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me." He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). "I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says. "It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. "So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could." Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. "I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. "I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. "Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. "Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. "It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software." After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. "I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. "Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics." He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. "Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states. "Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. "It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. "I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. "I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound." McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. "I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee. "I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive." At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. "I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. "[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me." She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. "He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. "I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. "When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened." McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. "Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains. "Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. "When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. "What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. "What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. "All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. "One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says. "And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out." Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. "I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says. "Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. "It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. "I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John." Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more." That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. "The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. "The government does from time to time. "I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. "Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so." McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. "The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says. "He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. "There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that." In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance. "I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this. "Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer." McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. "I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls. "All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. "You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that." Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest". "I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. "When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. "How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me." She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. "I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee. "We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment." A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. "After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says. "But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred." McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. "Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC. "The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize." So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. "There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says. "Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent." That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. "If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. "You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word. </body>

      <title>Norwegian Kenya attack suspect named</title>
      <description>A Norwegian man being investigated over the Westgate terror attacks is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, the BBC's Newsnight programme learns.</description>

      <body>The man being investigated by Norwegian police over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre is Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, BBC Newsnight has learned. The 23-year-old Norwegian citizen of Somali origin is suspected of helping to plan and carry out the attack. BBC Newsnight has spoken to a relative of his in Norway who said he left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. At least 67 people died in the attack in Nairobi, which the al-Qaeda linked group al-Shabab says it carried out. Last week Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which began on Saturday 21 September and lasted four days. It is unclear how many militants were involved. Police had initially estimated that there were 10-15 attackers inside the complex, but the CCTV footage which has so far been released by the Kenyan authorities shows just four men. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow is believed to be one of those four, the BBC's Newsnight programme has learned from sources in Kenya and Norway. Forensic investigators are still combing through the rubble of Westgate - no bodies have yet been identified and it is not known whether the attackers are alive or dead. Dhuhulow was born in Somalia, but he and his family moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. One relative, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that Dhuhulow left for Somalia in 2009. He made infrequent, increasingly erratic, phone calls to the family, they said, the last one coming in the summer when he said that he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage of the Kenya attackers by Newsnight, Dhuhulow's relative said: "I don't know what I feel or think... If it is him, he must have been brainwashed." Reporting for Newsnight, Gabriel Gatehouse travelled to the coastal town of Larvik, 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo, where Dhuhulow's family made their home. Morten Henriksen, one of the family's former neighbours, has not seen Dhuhulow for years. "He was pretty extreme, didn't like life in Norway… got into trouble, fights, his father was worried," Mr Henriksen said of Dhuhulow as a teenager. When shown the CCTV footage of the four Kenya attackers he said that the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket could be Dhuhulow. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight said that he was not surprised to learn that a Norwegian citizen was suspected of taking part in the attack. He said that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. "The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures," he said. "[Al-Shabab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries," he added. There have been reports that a Kenyan al-Shabab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, may have spent time in Norway. Norway's TV2 reported that Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application. Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims. Watch the full report in Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 BST on Thursday 17 October and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) </body>

      <body>Australian fire fighters are battling a series of major wildfires in New South Wales, with fears that hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The blazes are continuing to burn in the outskirts of Sydney, despite the easing of temperatures and winds. One man has died while trying to protect his home. Prime Minister Tony Abbott visited Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, one of the areas worst-hit by the fires, around 70km (45 miles) west of Sydney. Correspondents say bushfires are common in Australia but they have come earlier than normal this year, sparking concerns of further problems to come. Deputy New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service Commissioner Rob Rogers said the fire situation was the worst he had seen in more than a decade and the threat was unlikely to ease for some time. "We've got thousands of kilometres of fire front that we are faced with trying to deal with," he told local media. Hundreds of residents spent Thursday night in evacuation centres, with many returning home to find their houses razed. Fire fighters described blazes as tall as 20m to 30m (100ft). A 63-year-old man died from a heart attack as he tried to defend his home in Lake Munmorah, in the Central Coast region of NSW, on Thursday afternoon. Around 2,000 fire fighters across the state worked to try and contain the fires but many are still burning out of control, says the BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney. Mr Abbott, in Winmalee, said of those helping to battle the fires: "These are ordinary people who, on an extraordinary day, come together to support their community and to protect their fellow Australians." At least three fire fighters have been reported injured. Officials were still trying to determine the number of homes affected by the fire, with reports estimating the loss of as many as 200 homes. The fires have been caused by unseasonably hot temperatures and strong winds. While these have now died down, more hot weather is forecast next week. "It's been an awful 24 hours for the Blue Mountains [region]," Mayor Mark Greenhill told Nine Network Television. "We've lost possibly scores of homes." Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told local media that the situation remained "very active, very dynamic, very dangerous", despite the cooler conditions. Around 500 sq km (200 sq miles) had been burnt out so far, he added. Ron Fuller, who lost his home in Winmalee, told ABC News: "We've had a number of fires through here before but this was an extraordinary fire. The speed was extraordinary, it just raced through this whole area, took out some houses, left other ones standing." Jodie Harrison, Mayor of Lake Macquarie, said that four heritage homes, as well as a historic jetty, were caught in the fire. "It's been confirmed that four houses in the heritage village of Catherine Hill Bay have been lost," she told local media. NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell, in an interview on broadcaster 7 News, called the fires "some of the worst we have experienced around Sydney in living memory". "We're in for a long, tough summer," he added. Alex Chesser, a District Officer with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, told the BBC that the fires had come unusually early. "It's... a combination of a couple years of quite wet summers and winters which have allowed the bush to continue to grow at high rates, and also prevented us undertaking as many hazard reduction burns as we'd like," he said. Smoke and ash from the wildfires blanketed the Sydney skyline on Thursday. New South Wales was also hit by bush fires in September, which injured several fire fighters.

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, refuting suggestions that several distinct types were around at the same time, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H.habilis. But many features from the braincase were also unique to H.erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has unveiled the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remains known anywhere in the world. They are also the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group which emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection, it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation which had previously puzzled archaeologists, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. Their comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now." "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H.erectus, H.habilis and H.rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H.erectus, and not present in H.habilis and H.rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils can be "lumped into an evolving H.erectus lineage". "Only H.Erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <description>A court in Chile convicts four men for torturing and beating to death 24-year-old gay man Daniel Zamudio in a Santiago park in March.</description>

      <body>Four men in Chile have been convicted of murder for torturing and beating to death a young gay man in a Santiago park earlier this year. Judge Juan Carlos Urrutia said the four killers of Daniel Zamudio showed "total disrespect for human life". They broke Mr Zamudio's leg with a heavy stone, beat him up with bottles and carved swastikas into his body with broken glass before walking away. The four are due to be sentenced on 28 October. Patricio Ahumada, Alejandro Angulo, Raul Lopez and Fabian Mora are facing lengthy prison terms. The attack shocked Chile and led Congress in March to approve a law against hate crimes that had been waiting to be voted for seven years. "It is typical of us, Chileans, that an accident has to happen for us to approve a law. My son will not come back, but this case may end up being good for Chile," said Daniel's father, Ivan Zamudio. He was in court to hear the verdict, alongside Daniel's mother, Jacqueline Vera. "Of course I will not forgive them," Ivan Zamudio told El Mercurio newspaper. Daniel Zamudio was attacked on the night of 2 March at the San Borja de Alameda park in the Chilean capital. He was left for dead after an ordeal that lasted for several hours. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and died there 25 days later. Gay activist Rolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Gay Liberation and Integration Movement, told the Associated Press news agency that he was "satisfied" with the ruling. "There's a before and an after the Zamudio case,'' said Mr Jimenez. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <body>San Francisco's commuter rail could face a second strike in a year as negotiations between labour unions and the transit agency reach an impasse. The unions said a deal was "extremely close", but staff would walk out from midnight on Thursday unless management agreed to arbitration. A July industrial action shut down the rail, which serves 400,000 people in the Bay Area, for four days. The Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) dispute has lasted for six months. Agreement was near on the key sticking points of pay, healthcare and pension issues, said Roxanne Sanchez, president of the Service Employees International Union Local 1021. But she said management had rejected a union suggestion to take the remaining work-rule issues to arbitration, prompting the walkout threat. The two unions involved in the dispute represent nearly 2,400 train operators, station agents, maintenance workers and other staff. After July's strike, California Governor Jerry Brown ordered a 60-day cooling off period, which ended on Sunday. A federal mediator has been working since then with Bart and the unions. Commuters were initially braced for a strike on Thursday morning, but that was called off. Bart spokeswoman Alicia Trost said the rail operator had been inundated with calls and emails this week from commuters frustrated they had not been given earlier notice about whether the trains would run. </body>

      <body>At least 40 people were arrested after a protest at a shale gas development in the Canadian province of New Brunswick turned violent, say police. A shot was fired, petrol bombs were tossed and police cars torched at the blockade near the town of Rexton. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said arrests were made for firearms violations, threats and intimidation. Protesters have blockaded a staging area where an energy firm stores its equipment since 30 September. Violence erupted as officers moved in to enforce a court injunction won by the company to remove the protesters' highway camp, said police. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officials say at least five of their vehicles were set on fire and destroyed, Molotov cocktails were hurled at officers, and at least one shot was fired by someone who was not a police officer. SWN Resources, owned by Houston-based Southwestern Energy, is exploring the coastal province for shale gas. The reserves are removed from the ground by a controversial practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Opponents of the shale gas sector say drinking water can be polluted during this extraction process. The protesters, including regional First Nations, want SWN's seismic testing to stop. "There have been threats made to employees who were working with a private security firm at the site, as well as firearms offences, incidents of intimidation, mischief and other criminal behaviour," RCMP spokeswoman Constable Jullie Rogers-Marsh said in a statement. "For those reasons, and to ensure public safety, police action was required." Among those arrested on Thursday were members of the Elsipogtog First Nation, including their Chief, Arren Sock, Canadian media reported. Former Elsipogtog chief Susan Levi-Peters told the Globe and Mail newspaper the RCMP vehicles had been set on fire after Mr Sock and several other tribal members were arrested while trying to intervene. A councillor from the Elsipogtog First Nation told the Canadian Press news agency that police had used pepper spray on the protesters. "They sprayed the crowd that was there," Robert Levi said. "The chief was manhandled a little bit and all hell broke loose." He added the protesters would try to stay, despite the injunction. "This is what our people have been fighting for," Mr Levi said. </body>

      <title>Brazilian oil workers on strike</title>
      <description>Union leaders say 90% of Brazil's state oil company are on strike against planned auctions for rights to explore the huge offshore Libra oilfield.</description>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>Ethiopian authorities are torturing and mistreating political detainees to extract confessions, Human Rights Watch says. The US-based group says former prisoners at the main detention centre in Addis Ababa described being beaten and kicked during interrogation. It accuses Ethiopia of using anti-terrorism laws to stifle dissent. The government has dismissed the report as biased and lacking credible evidence, according to AFP news agency. The report by HRW says police investigators at Maekelawi prison use illegal interrogation methods, keep inmates in poor detention conditions, and routinely deny them access to a lawyer. Former detainees reported "being held in painful stress positions for hours upon end, hung from the wall by their wrists, often while being beaten", it said. "Ethiopian authorities right in the heart of the capital regularly use abuse to gather information," said Leslie Lefkow, HRW's deputy Africa director. "Beatings, torture, and coerced confessions are no way to deal with journalists or the political opposition." She called on the Ethiopian government to "root out the underlying culture of impunity". But Ethiopian authorities said the report was "extremely biased and ideologically marred". "They haven't come up with any proof," government spokesman Shimeles Kemal told AFP. He criticised the study for basing its findings on testimonials from 35 former inmates and their families, rather than an on-sight investigation. Among the former inmates interviewed was Martin Schibbye, a Swedish journalist convicted of entering the country illegally and supporting a rebel group. Protesters took to the streets in the Ethiopian capital in June to demand the release of jailed journalists and activists. It was the first major demonstration in Addis Ababa since 2005 when hundreds of protesters were killed in violence. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn took office in September 2012 following the death of Meles Zenawi. The Committee to Protect Journalists says the country is close to replacing Eritrea as the African country with the most journalists behind bars. </body>

      <body>More than 60 people have been killed in a series of bomb blasts across Iraq, with dozens more injured. At least nine attacks hit mainly Shia areas of Baghdad as Iraqis were celebrating the Eid al-Adha holiday. Earlier a suicide bomb in Mwafaqiya, a village inhabited by the Shabak minority near the northern city of Mosul, killed at least 15. No group has said it carried out the attacks, which come as violence in Iraq reaches its highest level since 2008. Correspondents say the failure of the Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority - which complains of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces - has driven the surge in unrest. Car bomb attacks took place across Baghdad province after sunset, as families were heading for parks and restaurants, police said. At least 44 people died in the blasts, which took place in several mainly Shia areas, including New Baghdad in the south-east, Sadr City in the east, and Husseiniyah. The authorities said three people also died in the mainly Sunni neighbourhood of Shurta, when a car exploded in a commercial area. In northern Iraq, police said three people were killed in a suicide attack inside a cafe in Tuz Khormato, about 200km (125 miles) north of Baghdad. But the biggest attack took place in Mwafaqiya, in Nineveh province, where 15 died and at least 52 were wounded when another vehicle rigged with explosives detonated in a residential area. The region, near the Syrian border, has a large Sunni population and sizeable ethnic minorities, including the Shabak, and al-Qaeda is active there. The UN envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the attack on the Shabak community, who largely follow a faith considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. In a statement he called for an end to the violence. "The recent rise in violence in the Nineveh province calls for urgent action and strengthened security cooperation" between the central government and local officials, as well as with authorities in the Kurdish autonomous region that borders Nineveh, Mr Mladenov said. Last month, a suicide bomb attack on a Shabak funeral in Nineveh killed more than 20 people. It is part of a surge in sectarian attacks as Iraq experiences levels of violence not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. </body>

      <body>Authorities in Florida are searching for two convicted murderers freed when their prison received forged paperwork ordering their release. Joseph Jenkins, and Charles Walker, both 34, were serving life sentences. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, authorities have said. Authorities were not notified of the issue until several weeks after the convicts' release. A manhunt was initiated for the two convicts after authorities learned of the error on Tuesday. "These two individuals are out. They shouldn't be, and we want to get them back in custody,'' Orange County sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters. "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody.'' Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six when he walked out of prison on 27 September. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. He was released on 8 October. According to media reports, authorities received release orders bearing the forged signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry and printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in Carrabelle. "Everything came the way it normally comes," Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman Misty Cash told local media. "Our department followed every protocol and did everything we are supposed to do." Law enforcement officials said they believed at least one of the convicts was still in the area. Authorities are also reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. </body>

      <body>A policeman in the Indian city of Mumbai who became lost in a crowded railway station as a child has been reunited with his family after 24 years, thanks to a distinctive tattoo. Ganesh Raghunath Dhangade was six when he was separated from his parents as he boarded a train. After being raised in orphanages, Mr Dhangade joined the police force and began to search for his family. A vital clue was the name of his mother Manda, tattooed on his right arm. His search finally led him to the house of an old lady, who mentioned the tattoo and broke down in tears when he showed it to her. "She explained about the tattoo on her son's arm. That was when I showed it to her," Mr Dhangade told the BBC's Kinjal Pandya in Mumbai. "She was totally surprised - she couldn't believe it. She almost started screaming for joy. All the villagers and neighbours were screaming too." Mr Dhangade has two younger brothers and two younger sisters. His father died after he became lost and his mother has been working as a domestic help. "Now that I am earning, my mum can stop working and I can take care of the whole family," he said. His mother said: "I am so happy. I lost my son and he has come back as a police constable." </body>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate. Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June. With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%. The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey. On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues. "I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said. Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government. Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime. Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control. Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities. While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014. When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>Venezuelan rescue teams have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people who died in a plane crash in January. The small plane carrying six passengers plunged into the Caribbean shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands. It was located in June some 70m (230ft) under the water, north of the Venezuelan archipelago. An investigation is underway to establish the causes of the accident. The bodies retrieved were those of Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni; two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in Los Roques, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi; and Venezuelan co-pilot Juan Carlos Ferrer. They were flown to a morgue in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. Mr Missoni was the son of Ottavio Missoni, founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. Relatives are due to arrive in Venezuela tonight. Rescue teams have been trying to recover the remains of the sixth victim: Venezuelan pilot German Marchant. Following the twin engine aircraft's disappearance on 4 January, investigators from the Italian Agency for Air Safety (ANSV) said the company that owned the small plane was not fully licensed to operate. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba. The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC. The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordnance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war. There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year. The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said. He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports. This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds. </body>

      <description>Child protection agencies warn social workers to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be trafficked.</description>

      <body>Social services have been warned to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be a cover for trafficking. Child protection organisations Cafcass, ADCS and Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB) have issued guidance to all social workers in the UK. They want to help them recognise signs of staged fake births. The Family Court has seen five cases of couples attempting to bring babies into the UK whom they are not related to. One couple claimed fertility treatment combined with their strong Christian faith had resulted in them conceiving in Nigeria - but tests showed the child, who was later taken into care, was not theirs. A dozen more cases were detected by the British consulate in Lagos - though officials say that the real numbers could be much higher. Charities voice 'miracle baby' fears Andy Elvin, chief executive of CFAB, described the cases as "disturbing" and urged social workers to involve the police, who can investigate whether couples have been involved in criminal activity or are the victims of a "cruel deception". "The most disturbing element is that babies are for sale," he said. "In the 21st century, humans are being bought and sold for somewhere in the region of £12,000. It's something we thought went out with slavery. "It's shocking that people are willing to sell babies, but it's just as shocking that people will buy them." Mr Elvin said that many of the birth mothers will have been coerced, and may even have been sold into prostitution. "There are many victims, but the real victims are of course the children," he said. "They won't know anything about their origins. It's like the dark days of adoption when people thought it best not to tell the child anything. "The effect on a child who discovers their life to be a lie can be profound - and can lead to mental health problems later on." CFAB worked with Cafcass - the Children and Family Court Advisory Service - and ADCS (Association of Directors of Children's Services) to produce a multi-agency information leaflet to assist social workers to recognise and understand the signs of faked birth - such as a lack of antenatal appointments - and to encourage referrals to the relevant authorities. Mr Elvin said that the aim was to "suspend disbelief" of such practices occurring and to work to prevent what he described as a "100% increase" in cases since 2005. In October last year, the High Court ruled that a couple could keep a baby they brought back from Nigeria - even though tests showed they were not the biological parents. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said she'd gone to the country for fertility treatment and was tricked into believing she had given birth. The presiding judge Mr Justice Coleridge said the pair - who he described as "people of the highest calibre and integrity" - were victims of the "most appalling scam". </body>

      <body>Police in India say they have arrested the crew of a US-owned ship accused of illegally entering Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons. MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October by the Indian Coast Guard and is anchored at Tuticorin port in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Its 35-member crew include Indians, Britons, Ukrainians and Estonians. The vessel, owned by a private US-based security firm, is registered in Sierra Leone, officials say. The US embassy in the capital, Delhi, told the BBC they had "no comment" to make on the reports. A police official in Tuticorin said that the crew have been taken to the Motiapuram police station where they are being questioned. Since February last year, India and Italy have been embroiled in a bitter diplomatic row after India arrested two Italian marines for killing two Indian fishermen. The marines - who are being prosecuted in India - were accused of shooting the fishermen off the Kerala coast. They were guarding an Italian oil tanker and said they mistook the fishermen for pirates. In recent years piracy has emerged as a major threat to merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, with Somali pirates hijacking ships and their crews for ransom. But there have been fewer attacks recently, partly because more armed guards are now deployed on board ships. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <body>A grand coalition between Germany's centre-right and centre-left parties has moved a step nearer, nearly a month after the general election. The leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed on formal negotiations. They reached agreement at a third round of exploratory talks in Berlin. CDU leaders seem to have softened their opposition to a national minimum wage, a concession to the SPD. Some of the negotiating will be over who gets which ministry, the BBC's Steve Evans reports from the German capital. If the SPD take charge of finance, the departure of current minister Wolfgang Schaeuble may mean a softening of German economic policy. Forming a new German government can be a long and difficult process but all the signs now point to a grand coalition, our correspondent says. The CDU, along with its Bavarian sister party the CSU, fell just short of an outright majority at the polls on 22 September. The CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. Germany is the EU's most populous country and has its biggest economy, making it a pivotal member of the eurozone. "At the end of the third round of exploratory talks we are convinced that we can find sensible solutions for both sides, and most of all for the country, even on disputed questions," SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel said. "The conservatives know... that a nationwide minimum wage of 8.5 euros [£7.2; $11.5]... is one of the central tasks and without this a coalition would not make sense for the SPD. That was no big surprise for the CDU/CSU." CDU secretary general Hermann Groehe said: "We have a joint goal of seeing a sensible minimum wage ruling - I am sure we will find a result but we didn't discuss it today." "In the three exploratory sessions it became clear that with regards to identifying the most pressing political tasks facing Germany over the next four years and how to deal with these, we can find enough common ground to rule this country successfully," he said. The chairman of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, said the paramount issue for him remained "no tax increases and no new debt", according to the Munich daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats so the two-term chancellor set about seeking a new partner. Talks with the Greens ended in failure on Wednesday and both of the big parties have ruled out a coalition with the Left Party. As well as the proposed minimum wage, taxation will also be a key issue for the talks. The SPD has not won an election since 2002 and it joined a previous grand coalition under Mrs Merkel in 2005. One final hurdle for the coalition deal will be a vote by SPD party members, promised by the party leadership, on whether to endorse it. </body>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases of human trafficking discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to new government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often trafficked for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims of trafficking were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims are brought to the UK do anything from work as house slaves to work in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work, in particular laying paving, drives or ground work. Other victims are forced to work in nail bars or takeaways. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud. The trafficking gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to their victims. Those targeted by the traffickers are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes members of their own family. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. She also said the government's Modern Slavery Bill would contain new anti-trafficking measures, including: </body>

      <title>Inspectors hail progress in Syria</title>
      <description>Chemical weapons inspectors say they are making good progress in Syria, having completed nearly 50% of their work.</description>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria say they have completed nearly half of their work in the country. A spokesman for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons (OPCW) said the team was making good progress in its mission to inspect more than than 20 sites. However he said security remained a concern for the 60 inspectors - who have been in Syria since 1 October. "A few" sites remained inaccessible to the team for security reasons, he said. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August. The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict. The OPCW, which is based in The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting sites and destroying equipment. Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014. The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday. OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC that there had been a number of security incidents over the last few days which had given the inspectors "cause for concern". On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus. Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights. The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative. An international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday. He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN. More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country. Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August. It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces. But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it. </body>

      <body>A Palestinian man who used a tractor to break into an Israeli army base in the West Bank has been shot and killed by soldiers, according to a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. The man broke down the gate to the base, between Ramallah and Jerusalem. Military doctors treated the man for his injuries but he died a short time later. There were no Israeli injuries. Palestinian sources told AFP that the dead man was named Yusef Ahmed al-Radaydeh. Israeli media reports say Radaydeh was the brother of Miri al-Radaydeh, who rammed a bus and a police car, injuring two policemen, with a bulldozer before being shot dead, in Jerusalem in 2009. There have been a number of recent deadly attacks by Palestinians on Israelis in the West Bank, as well as the shooting of a nine-year-old girl a fortnight ago. The BBC's Kevin Connolly, in Jerusalem, says the violent incidents form an unpromising backdrop to the peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, which continue behind closed doors. </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <title>Litigation 'could paralyse' military</title>
      <description>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential think tank warns.</description>

      <body>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential right-leaning think tank has warned. A report for Policy Exchange says legal action may paralyse the armed forces. It highlights a surge in legal claims against the Ministry of Defence - totalling 5,827 in 2012-13. But lawyers for the families of service personnel dismissed the findings as "political" and "biased". The report says litigation has led to the MoD employing around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year. Entitled 'the Fog of Law', it points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces. The report's authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer, teaching international and operational law. The main "weapon" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), they argue. Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts. This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts. In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government using Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision thrown out by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR. This year, the Supreme Court ruled that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. The report's authors claim that in the long run, "legal creep" could pose a "mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed." They say that the extension of law risks "catastrophically weakening the UK". And they claim it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. Military personnel should not be above the law, says Lt Col Tugendhat. But he added: "As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended." Their report recommends that: But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions. "This report seems to me to be part of a concerted political attack on the Human Rights Act," said Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones and Allen. "Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad. "It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat." Martyn Day from the law firm Leigh Day, which has also fought several high profile cases against the MoD, labelled the report "biased". He said his firm would argue that it is "the breaking of laws which poses the greatest threat to those who risk all for their country. "This includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone." He added: "Greater adherence to the laws, both domestic and international, are the only way in which the MoD's litigation will decrease." The arguments in the report echoed those of the Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, who remains concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements, which could make it more difficult for troops to carry out operations in the future. </body>

      <title>Google shares hit record highs</title>
      <description>Recovering from a surprising miss last quarter, Google reports a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations.</description>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" after recent back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," he said. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of the injury. He recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. He tweeted a picture of himself in hospital with his thumbs up after the operation. </body>

      <body>Pakistan ended South Africa's 15-match unbeaten run with a seven-wicket victory in the first Test in Abu Dhabi. Chasing 40 to beat the world number one side on day four, Pakistan wobbled on 7-3 before completing only a fourth ever victory over the Proteas. South Africa had previously been bowled out for 249 and 232, either side of centuries from Khurram Manzoor and Misbah-ul-Haq taking Pakistan to 442. In their last Test match, Pakistan lost by 24 runs to Zimbabwe. Misbah's side had also been whitewashed 3-0 in South Africa in February, but they continued a fine run of form in the United Arab Emirates - their adopted home after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka team in Lahore in 2009. Since then, Pakistan are unbeaten in nine matches in the UAE - a streak that includes the 3-0 whitewash of England in 2012. Victory over the Proteas was delayed by the efforts of AB De Villiers and Robin Peterson, who at least ensured Graeme Smith's side avoided an innings defeat. The tourists began the final day on 72-4 - still 121 short of making Pakistan bat again - and slipped further into trouble at 133-6 when Faf du Plessis drilled at off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, who took a fine return catch. De Villiers, though, found an ally in Peterson for a busy stand of 57, only for the wicketkeeper to fall 10 short of a century, driving Junaid Khan to Shan Masood Khan. Peterson's defiance continued, but with Ajmal wrapping up the tail for four wickets in the innings and seven in the match, Pakistan were facing a meagre target. They stumbled as Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn tore through the top three, but Misbah, supported by Younus Khan, led his side to victory on 28 not out, sealing the win by hitting Peterson for six. Pakistan lead the two-Test series 1-0, with the second match beginning in Dubai on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>London's mayor wins over young admirers in China</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Who is the true father of football in Brazil?</title>
      <description>The little-known Scot vying for title of man who took football to Brazil</description>

      <body>Leaning against the wall of a dusty warehouse in Bangu, a bland suburb in western Rio de Janeiro, a huge statue of a thickly-moustachioed footballer prepares to right a terrible historical wrong. With hair slicked back and an arm raised in a moment of goalscoring celebration, the four-and-a-half metre cast bronze effigy of Thomas Donohoe is due to be unveiled in the car park of the local shopping centre next month. In the early 1890s, the site housed a textile factory. Many of its workers were British immigrants, one of whom was Donohoe. This man, his sculptor argues, has been overlooked as the true father of Brazilian football and it's time the world knows about him. Ask almost any Brazilian football fan outside of Bangu who brought football to the country, though, and the answer you're likely to get is Charles Miller. Born in Sao Paulo in 1874, the son of a Scottish railway engineer and his Brazil-born wife, Miller was sent to school in Southampton at the age of 10. As a keen fan of the new sport, the headmaster of Banister Court School encouraged his pupils to play football. Miller proved a natural talent. Two years before he left school, he was already playing centre-forward for the first team. Later, he was picked for St Mary's FC (now Southampton) and played a few games for the Corinthians. Ten years after arriving in England, he returned to Brazil. In his luggage, famously, he packed two footballs and a book containing the 13 rules of association football. The match he organised, on 14 April 1895, between the workers of the Sao Paulo Railway and those of the Gas Company, all of whom were British, is widely considered the first football match to have been played in Brazil. A few years later, Miller established the country's first football league, cementing his status as the founder of the game in Brazil. But the residents of Bangu hope their new monument will convince football fans visiting Rio during next year's World Cup that it is really Donohoe who deserves the credit. "Thomas Donohoe was the first to bring a football to Brazil, eight months before Charles Miller," Clecio Regis, the statue's designer, tells me in his workshop. "They [Miller's supporters] accept this, but they say it was just for a kickabout. There's no way Donohoe would have settled for just a kickabout for eight months." The excitable 53-year old, a set designer, sculptor and owner of the second-largest Bangu Atletico Clube flag in existence, says the only reason Miller is credited with the discovery of the game is because he brought it to Sao Paulo. "People always forget about Bangu, but the first football in the country was the one brought here, by Thomas Donohoe," he adds. Thomas Donohoe was born in Busby, a mill town six miles outside Glasgow, in 1863. That same year, the world's first Football Association  was founded in London. Aged 10, Donohoe followed his father into the print works, working as a dyer. And about the same time as he joined the company, he set up its first football team. Few records of his sporting feats survive though, with the exception of a match report from 1887 praising his performance for Busby in an otherwise humiliating 5-2 defeat by Cartvale. Marriage, and children, followed. Struggling with a growing family and a meagre income, Donohoe sought opportunities outside Scotland. With British technical skills in demand as Latin America attempted to industrialise, he found a job as a master dyer at a new textile factory in Brazil. In May 1894, he set sail from Southampton to Rio, leaving behind his wife and two young sons. Little documentary evidence has been produced to flesh out the details of Donohoe's life in Latin America, particularly relating to his first football games. But Carlos Molinari, the official historian of Bangu Atletico Clube, is trying to put that right. Bangu consisted of little more than a single street and the textile factory when Donohoe arrived. According to Molinari, the Scot soon settled among the small British expat community in the village. Though happy with his job, and his new friends, he pined for his old hobby, finding Bangu's Sunday pastimes of cycling or music no match for football. He was horrified to discover there were no teams in the neighbourhood, no equipment to be bought in the shops, and no knowledge of the game whatsoever among the locals. So Donohoe wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to join him, and to bring a football, as well as their children. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. According to Molinari, it was a six-a-side match between British workers, and took place eight months before Charles Miller's game. Few supporters of Charles Miller's claim to be the father of Brazilian football dispute the accuracy of Molinari's work. They do, however, question Donohoe's significance. "Nobody is saying that no-one kicked a ball in Brazil before 1895," says John Mills, Miller's biographer. "But an organised game is an organised game." Of Miller's famed luggage, Mills argues the rulebook mattered more than the footballs. "The Sao Paulo Railway versus Gas Company match was the first recorded 11-a-side match using association football rules in Brazil." Mills shows me a letter written to a Brazilian sports journalist in 1937 by Hans Nobling, a German sportsman credited with helping to promote the game in the early stages of its development. "When I arrived in Sao Paulo, on 15 May 1897, football was unheard of in Sao Paulo and most likely throughout Brazil. […] To my mind, the honour of having brought to Sao Paulo the first ball for a game of football falls, without doubt, to Charles Miller," he wrote. Antonio Carlos Napoleao, a football historian I meet in the trophy-stuffed offices of the Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol, agrees with Mills. "I think this idea that there was some guy from Scotland who played a few games here in Rio de Janeiro is very vague," he says. "That's playing football, not implanting football. They are two completely different things. Charles Miller implanted football in the country: he created a club and helped to launch the first official championship." Back in Bangu, now an unfashionable suburb with a second division club, such arguments cut little ice. Molinari argues the town would have boasted the first football club in the country had it not been for the intervention of one of the managers of the textile factory, who believed all games, including football, would lead to degeneracy among his workers. By the time the factory owners relented, in 1904, the Sao Paulo league was already in its third season. But some Banguenses, while still asserting Donohoe's contribution has been overlooked, acknowledge a degree of local pride colours their reasoning. Benevenuto Rovere, 67, is one of the founders of the Gremio Literario Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos, Bangu's local museum. Inside the cavernous room are replicas of Donohoe's football and boots. On its walls are hundreds of black and white photos chronicling the town's history, including an image of Bangu Atletico Clube's line-up from 1905, which features Francisco Carregal, the first black man to play for a Brazilian football club. After he shows me around the museum, I ask Rovere if he would still support Donohoe's claim if he were not from Bangu. After a long pause, he answers: "It's in the blood, isn't it? I wouldn't swap my neighbourhood for any other. It's where I was born and it's where I've lived all my life. And every day I am more convinced that the birthplace of football is here in Bangu." </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>Lance Armstrong, master storyteller</title>
      <description>Were fans too ready to believe cyclist's story?</description>

      <body>To his millions of fans, American cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was more than just a great sportsman, he was an inspiration. To the film-maker who documented his spectacular fall from grace, he was a master storyteller. But were his supporters too ready to believe the fairytale? The story of the charismatic Texan cyclist who recovered from life-threatening cancer and went on to win the Tour de France a record seven successive times was one of the greatest tales in sporting history. In 2009, Lance Armstrong attempted to write another chapter into the legend by coming out of professional retirement to compete in the Tour again at the age of 37. He granted Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney rare access to his inner circle to chronicle the comeback. For Gibney, the experience was akin to being embedded with the military in a warzone. "When you're with a group of soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan you're going to end up feeling part of their unit," he told me. "I don't think that's necessarily wrong. The trick is how to come out of that with some broader perspective - but it's intoxicating while you're in the middle of it." Gibney admits the "them and us" mentality inside Lance Armstrong's Astana cycling team encouraged a kind of Stockholm syndrome. Anyone who questioned his repeated denials that he had used performance-enhancing drugs came to be viewed as the enemy. "I did begin to feel that some people on the outside were a bit fanatical about the subject of whether Lance had doped," he says. "You can't help but take on the vibe of the team." Through the media and in the courts, Armstrong aggressively pursued critics who continued to question whether he was riding clean. Alex Gibney watched as his subject attempted to maintain control over the powerful and lucrative myth he had constructed. "I think the truth in the mind of someone who is a master storyteller does become elastic," he suggests. "There's a moment in the film when Lance loses in Verbier to Alberto Contador (on stage 15 of the 2009 Tour de France) and he says to me 'I'm sorry I screwed up your documentary.' "I don't think that was just banter. I think that was Lance's way of saying 'you came to me to deliver the fairytale that everyone's come to believe that I can deliver and I failed. I'm not going to win. I'm not going to be first and I'm sorry.'" After Armstrong's 2009 comeback, in which he finished third, the myth began to disintegrate. Former teammates went public with allegations of drug use. The US Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong of running the most sophisticated and extensive doping scheme in professional sports history. He finally came clean in an interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey last January, in which he admitted taking banned substances and undergoing prohibited blood transfusions during all of his victorious Tour de France campaigns. In earlier films such as Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, Taxi to the Dark Side and Mea Maxima Culpa, Alex Gibney has explored the abuse of power by big businesses, the military and the Catholic Church. In his latest film, it's Armstrong's rewriting of his own personal life story, a story that inspired and gave hope to cancer patients around the world, that Gibney finds particularly difficult to accept. "It's an abuse of storytelling power," he says. "He told a story that everyone wanted to believe in too much. He knew how much everybody wanted to believe in it. "He made the lie so enormous, so all-encompassing, that he couldn't dial it back. His only choice was to go forward and make it even bigger." So he carried on cheating, winning Tour after Tour. Stripped of those seven titles, pursued by lawyers seeking to reclaim prize and sponsorship money, Lance Armstrong's reputation as a sportsman is now in ruins. He has been banned from competitive cycling for life. For Alex Gibney, Lance Armstrong's epic downfall should serve as a cautionary tale. Even heroes, he argues, need to accept their flaws. "There can be inspirational stories that are messy," he says. "Spiderman to me is a more intriguing tale than Superman because you reckon with Peter Parker's dark past and to some extent his deep-seated anger rather than the pure hero that Superman is. "When we're told stories that seem too good to be true we should say to ourselves, 'Hey, maybe this is too good to be true.'" Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Abuja: Nigeria's unfinished capital</title>
      <description>The Nigerian capital of Abuja - still unfinished, decades later</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24404633</url>

      <body>When one of Nigeria's long line of military rulers, General Olusegun Obasanjo, seized the land on which Abuja was to be built in the late 1970s, he could hardly have imagined that the city would remain unfinished 35 years on. Abuja has a makeshift, haphazard feel to it: A place of bureaucrats and building sites, its streets eerily empty after the buzz of Lagos or the enterprising bustle of Kano. It is one of the most expensive cities in Africa, and one of the most charmless. The skyline is dominated by the space-rocket spires of the National Christian Centre and the golden dome of the National Mosque, facing each other pugnaciously across a busy highway at the city's centre. Its other striking landmark is the vast construction site of the Millennium Tower, which, if it is ever completed, will be Nigeria's tallest building. The skyscraper was intended to mark Abuja's 20th birthday in 2011. Now delayed until who-knows-when, hugely over-budget and the subject of numerous official investigations. All the people of Abuja have to show for the billions invested in the project are two stunted fingers of scaffold-clad concrete. I had been in Abuja for three days - about two-and-a-half too many - when my friend, Atta, a sociologist, picked me up from my hotel. We drove out towards Aso Rock, the monolith looming over the presidential palace. On either side of the road there are complexes of bulky, imposing mansions, most of them unfinished. Some had empty swimming pools; others had mock-Tudor timbering, but were windowless and often roofless. Atta told me that 65% of the houses in these developments were uninhabited, put up only to launder Abuja's dirty money. Like the Millennium Tower, these grandiose schemes are ruins before they are completed, bleak monuments to a city built by kleptocratic politicians on stolen land. We pulled off the Murtala Mohammed Highway at Mpape Junction, and immediately the road deteriorated. "I am going to show you the real Abuja," Atta told me, as his car struggled up a deeply-rutted dirt track. A warm wind from the desert to the north - the Harmattan - whipped clouds of red dust around us as we climbed through rocky scrubland into the hills. People began to appear on the streets - men carrying ancient Singer sewing machines, women balancing baskets on their heads. We entered a vast shanty-town of shacks with corrugated iron roofs, slums stacking to the horizon. Nissan minivans scuttled past - they are called "One Chance" buses, as they barely stop on their manic journeys through these uncharted streets. Crowds thronged between skinny cows, beneath posters advertising beaming televangelists. Dance music blared out, interrupted by a muezzin's call to prayer. Bright-eyed children kicked footballs about. This was the home of the Gwari people, the original inhabitants of the land where the capital was built. Hundreds of thousands of them were summarily evicted in the 1970s, and now scrape a living in the hills. Abuja is itself a Gwari word and, although the city of generals and politicians below us had barely 700,000 inhabitants, two or three million people live in these shanty towns, many of them Gwari. The Gwari people continue to fight for compensation for the land wrested from them by the Obasanjo government, land now worth more per square kilometre than almost anywhere else in Africa. We got out and walked through the smoke and dust towards a row of shacks. In one of them, a woman knelt on the ground plucking a chicken, a man above her leaning on a makeshift bar. They were Frank and Mary, Gwari people in their thirties, children of one of the thousands of families originally evicted during the foundation of Abuja. The four of us sat in the shack sipping Fantas, staring out at the swarming life of the shanty town: Motorbikes and cattle and people, all of them through a veil of reddish dust. "I trained as an architect," Frank told me. "I have an education. But I do not have money, I don't know the right people. So I work here with my sister. In Abuja, money defines everything." I ask him about the empty mansions lining the roads into the city. "That is pseudo-Abuja, a false place. It's unjust - we should be living in those houses. Instead…" He gestured to the squalid lean-to that jutted from the back of the bar. Mary looked up from her chicken. "Life here is difficult," she says. "Often we can't see across the street because of the smoke and dust. If it rains, you can't move for the mud. But we pray hard." Frank pulled out a CD. It was Fela Kuti's Suffering and Smiling. "This," Frank said, as the music coiled out from an ancient hi-fi, "is the compressed statement of Nigerian society. We suffer, but we smile. Nothing will change until we get angry, until we stop smiling." A storm was coming in, red clouds rolling overhead and thunder crackling down the valleys. Frank and Mary stood waving to us, the music playing still, as we drove off down the hill, towards pseudo-Abuja. From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.

      <title>Tony Abbott's month in office</title>
      <description>How has new Australian leader's first month gone?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24550904</url>

      <body>Australia's new Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to power one month ago, saying he wanted to take politics off the front pages. It was perhaps an unusual remark for a man who you might have thought would have welcomed that his time in the limelight had finally come. But after the sometimes soap opera-style politics of Labor's Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era, one of the main messages Mr Abbott seems to have wanted to send out is "everybody just calm down". "He has definitely wanted to project the image of there being a steady hand at the tiller," says Dr Peter Chen, a lecturer in media politics at the University of Sydney. The message has been "a period of uncertain government is over and the grown-ups have arrived in town", says Mr Chen, who like most people believes Labor's infighting and disunity was at the root of the party's election loss. "Tony Abbott spent four years presenting a sense of chaos in the Rudd-Gillard governments, so an aura of calm was the ideal contrast to try and make," says Paula Matthewson, a political blogger and former adviser to former Primer Minister John Howard. One way Mr Abbott had tried to keep politics out of the papers - or at least the wrong kind of politics - has been by trying to control the amount of media appearances his ministers make. All requests for media interviews apparently now have to be run past the prime minister's office first. The strategy might have worked. Even Mr Abbott's critics acknowledge things have gone relatively smoothly. "I'd give him seven or eight out of 10," says Dr Chen a little begrudgingly, adding that might be down to what he calls the "Sarah Palin effect: it's not been the disaster that everyone thought it might have been". There have been some difficult moments. The new prime minister did receive some flak when he announced that his new cabinet would contain only one woman, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. But the move didn't seem to take too many people by surprise. There has been a small expenses scandal. Mr Abbott was forced to pay back more than $1,500 (£935) of taxpayers' money that he claimed in travel expenses to attend the wedding of two colleagues back in 2006. There have also been questions about the prime minister, a well-known fitness fanatic, having used public money to travel to take party in various sporting events, including a triathlon. But at least so far, the revelations don't really seem to have gained much traction. It's likely the now Labor opposition won't want to push for any investigations too hard, fearing their own expenses might be the next ones to be peered into. And the fact that for the past month the Labor Party has been distracted by its own leadership contest, won this week by Bill Shorten, has meant the new government has had things relatively easy. "Labor has vacated the field for the first month, which has really given Abbott a clean shot," says Ms Matthewson. "It's allowed Abbott to get away with things he might not have been able to do and to set the agenda." And his agenda has not presented too many surprises. The new government this week drew up draft legislation to repeal Labor's carbon tax, an issue Mr Abbott campaigned hard on. Whether he can do it as quickly as he wants to is another matter. Mr Abbott's coalition has a majority in the lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, but not in the upper house, the Senate. The approval of both houses is needed to ratify legislation. The government might have to wait until July 2014 when senators elected last month who are against the carbon tax get to take up their seats. On foreign policy, Mr Abbott has applied his mantra that the focus would be "more towards Jakarta than Geneva". His first foreign visit was to Indonesia for the APEC summit earlier this month. Mr Abbott will need Indonesia's help if he is to meet his campaign promise to "stop the boats" carrying asylum seekers to Australia's shores. Indonesia is a key transit point for the people smugglers who bring them here. Tony Abbott has said it will be a stand-or-fall issue for him, but realistically it will require assistance from Indonesia if the flow of asylum-seekers is to be stopped. "Some of the inflammatory rhetoric towards Indonesia on asylum-seekers has quickly disappeared" says Mr Chen. "Abbott has been much more conciliatory in power than opposition." These are of course early days. The saying goes that a week is a long time in politics. But a month is probably too short to judge a government. </body>

      <title>Transsexual PC sues Essex police</title>

      <body>A transsexual police officer is suing her force after she allegedly had to "out" herself over a police radio system, the BBC has learned. PC Emma Chapman claims Essex Police failed to help its officers understand transgender issues and properly investigate what had happened. The case, believed to be the first of its kind, was heard at an employment tribunal which is now considering its findings. Essex Police disputes the allegations. PC Chapman, 44, was born male and underwent gender reassignment in 1999 while serving as a volunteer officer with Essex Police. Four years later she became a full-time constable and now works on the force's response team. It is thought she is the only transgender officer in the force. PC Chapman said that after initially telling people about the sex change and raising awareness of transgender issues at conferences, she became "frustrated" at the lack of support and understanding about the problems transsexuals faced. She decided not to be "open" any longer and "stepped away" from dealing with transgender issues in 2009. According to legal documents, seen by the BBC, her claim centres on three incidents when she had to speak to the police force's control room via her radio handset. PC Chapman says that on the first occasion, in October 2012, the operator did not believe who she was, saying she had a "male voice". In her witness statement, the police constable said: "I felt a combination of alarm and distress. " I replied... 'I am a transsexual'. "I felt very embarrassed and desperate. The incident took my breath away." PC Chapman said she was left feeling "very distressed" that she'd had to "out" herself over a radio channel that was listened to by hundreds of officers and staff. She reported what had happened but claims Essex police failed to carry out a full investigation and interview the control room operator. Legal papers say two further incidents occurred in June 2013 when the officer was again challenged by control room staff who questioned her identity. "I felt a growing sense of apprehension whenever I had to use the radio, concerned that there may be further, similar incidents," she said. "The radio is also a lifeline at times and I should not have to feel hesitant or anxious about using it." PC Chapman, who's a Police Federation constables representative in Essex, secured the backing of the federation to bring legal proceedings against the force. The officer said the incidents created an "intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment" for her to work in. She is seeking compensation for injury to her feelings and a declaration of discrimination and wants the force to improve the way it deals with transgender issues. Essex Police said it "disagreed" with PC Chapman's assertions and was contesting the case. A spokesman acknowledged that conversations between PC Chapman and the control room had taken place but said the force disputed the "precise wording and tone" said to have been used. The case was heard at the East London Tribunal Court last week after PC Chapman turned down an out-of-court settlement. A decision is expected in the next few months. It is thought that, if she is is successful, PC Chapman could receive compensation of up to £3,000, though her main objective is said to be to highlight the way transgender people are treated. Roy Scanes, Essex Police Federation's branch board secretary, confirmed that PC Chapman had the federation's backing for what was an "important" and "unusual" case but declined to comment until there had been a ruling. </body>

      <body>A police officer shot dead when he tackled a gunman in the street near his home has posthumously been given a national bravery award. PC Ian Dibell, 41, was voted as the most courageous officer at the annual Police Bravery Awards, where 13 other officers were also honoured. They included a PC who dived into a quarry to save a boy from drowning. Mr Dibell died while trying to stop Peter Reeve, who had fired at a couple in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. He was selected as the overall winner after officers were nominated for awards by 37 forces across England and Wales. Other winners were: Peter Reeve, 64, had fired shots at his neighbour Trevor Marshall and Mr Marshall's girlfriend, Katarzyna Karolak, and then chased Mr Marshall in his blue Toyota. PC Dibell, a father-of-two, leaned into the car window to try and grab the gun, and a bullet passed through his hand and into his chest, causing fatal injuries. The constable had ran back to his house to get his warrant card when he realised a gunman was on the loose, meaning that technically he was on duty when he died. Mr Reeve took his own life in a churchyard in Writtle, Essex, the next day. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Officers put others' lives before their own. "Sadly, as our winner's story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. "PC Ian Dibell was a valiant team player; his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life - always putting others before himself." Home Secretary Theresa May said: "Ian Dibell's death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. "PC Dibell was off duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm's way. "His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world." </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The lettings group said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high.

      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases of human trafficking discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to new government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often trafficked for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims of trafficking were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims are brought to the UK do anything from work as house slaves to work in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work, in particular laying paving, drives or ground work. Other victims are forced to work in nail bars or takeaways. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud. The trafficking gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to their victims. Those targeted by the traffickers are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes members of their own family. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. She also said the government's Modern Slavery Bill would contain new anti-trafficking measures, including: </body>

      <title>School's exam results thrown out</title>
      <description>Exam results for an entire year group at a Lincoln school are thrown out after allegations of "false marking".</description>

      <body>Exam results for an entire year at a Lincoln school have been thrown out amid concerns over "false marking". Manor Leas Junior Academy's Sats results from the summer were annulled by the Department for Education (DfE). It followed an investigation by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA) prompted when one exam paper too many was submitted for marking. Head James Greenwood said pupils' education was not affected and teacher assessments reflected their progress. The problem arose when an external marker for the school's Sats flagged up an extra exam paper. When the school could not account for the paper, Mr Greenwood referred the matter to the STA which investigated. A spokesman for the DfE said the STA found "maladministration" and took the standard step of annulling all the Year 6 results. "We take any allegation of false marking very seriously," he added "Following an investigation, the Standards and Testing Agency annulled the results of the maths and grammar, punctuation and spelling Key Stage 2 tests at Manor Leas." The school has not been inspected since converting to an academy but was ranked good overall by Ofsted last year. In a statement, Mr Greenwood said the problem was down to an "internal staffing issue". "The incident was dealt with robustly and professionally with the exam board in line with school policies," he said. "I have been advised that I cannot discuss discipline issues due to legal reasons and confidentiality." He added: "I wish to make it clear that the education of the pupils at Manor Leas Junior Academy has not been affected and we will continue to provide excellent standards of teaching and learning." Because the school's results were annulled, it will mean no pupils achieve level four in their Sats, the measure used in the league table. Schools are expected to get the majority of children to level four by the end of Key Stage 2. It also means the children have no formal measure of their progress to take to secondary school. One parent, who did not wish to be named, said she did not have a lot of faith in the system. "I got a letter about three weeks ago saying that the marks had changed and they were unable to give a specific grade," she said. </body>

      <title>Store defends 'legal high' trade</title>

      <body>The owners of a shop that sells legal highs have defended their firm after a 17-year-old suffered a near-fatal reaction to a product they sold. Matt Ford had to be treated in hospital after he smoked incense called Exodus Damnation, from Skunkworks in Canterbury. In a letter to Conservative MP Julian Brazier, a Skunkworks spokesman said it boasted "extremely high moral codes". Mr Brazier wrote to the home secretary calling for the store to be shut down. In its letter, UK Skunkworks said: "The paraphernalia that we sell is not for drug use, we sell a wide range of popular products that are received very well by an adult market. "The online industry of products we sell is extensive, however up until now the regulation of the products has been impossible. "Our stores operate a number of strict policies and are enforced by a large team. "These policies ensure that young people under the age of 18 can not enter our stores whatsoever." It reiterates that it took disciplinary action after Matt, a student at Canterbury College, managed to buy Exodus Damnation from one of its stores. The letter ends: "Calling for UK Skunkworks to be shut down is a pitiful attempt at dealing with the issues we face. "I think you again fail to understand that we trade legally and take our business very seriously. If you wish to meet with us I think you will find us most accommodating and open minded." In his letter to Theresa May, Mr Brazier, who represents Canterbury and Whitstable, called for Skunkworks and "its fellow shops and its websites" to be banned. He said Skunkworks' get-out clause over the substances for sale at its shop was they were "not for human consumption", but its advice was to "help you relax" by burning the herbs in the home. Legal highs mimic the effects of illegal drugs, but are not banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Home Office minister and MP for Lewes in East Sussex, Norman Baker said: "We do take action within weeks to ban particular substances. "I have asked officials to look at this particular one in the light of the incident which you've drawn my attention to, and I expect a swift reply on it." </body>

      <body>Drunk students who brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill while singing and dancing along to a cult football chant have been criticised by Northumbria Police. Footage of dozens of people joining in a song praising brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure was posted online. Collingwood Street was blocked for several minutes at 03:00 BST on Wednesday, police said. The chant uses the tune of 2 Unlimited's 1993 single, No Limit. It originated from the time both players were at Manchester City. Kolo now plays for Liverpool. It is thought the chanting was started by a Chelsea-supporting friend of a Manchester City fan. The outbreak of dancing came to the attention of Yaya who tweeted his thanks to those who joined in. Police said the "rowdy" behaviour could have resulted in injuries. Central neighbourhood inspector Caroline Ord said: "This type of drunken and disorderly behaviour will not be tolerated by police in Newcastle city centre. "We want young people to come into the city centre and have a good time but they must behave responsibly." </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

But he beat Isaac Chilemba in a rematch in May  , having drawn the first fight, to secure a second world title shot. Stevenson, 36, has been beaten once in 23 fights and will be a big favourite. The Haiti-born Canadian won the title with a first-round knockout of Chad Dawson in June  and defended it with a seventh-round retirement of Tavoris Cloud in September. Stevenson's only defeat was as a super-middleweight in 2010 and he has 19 knockouts in 22 victories. </body>

Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16 after a six-week trial at Norwich Crown Court. During his trial it was questioned whether the authorities could have done more to stop the abuse. In 1991 Norfolk County Council allowed Souter to adopt. Norfolk Social Services spokeswoman Sheila Lock said all the appropriate checks had been done on the "devious" abuser. Three years later he was arrested and the adoption terminated though no criminal action was taken. Chris McCann, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said because there was no file relating to that period, he was not in a position to say whether or not CPS or the police could have "done something different" in 1993.

      <body>A life-size bronze statue of a horse that came to symbolise the IRA's bomb attack in London's Hyde Park more than 30 years ago has been unveiled at the Royal Veterinary College. Camilla Le May, the college's artist in residence, created the giant model in a giant shed near Ticehurst, in East Sussex, close to where she lives. Sefton was badly injured in the bombing in 1982, but survived, unlike seven of his stable-mates and four soldiers. The artist studied photos of the gelding and talked to people who knew him to ensure her statue was as lifelike as possible. Sefton continued serving with the army for another two years and was put down in 1993 at the age of 30. </body>

      <title>Why academics are taking comic books seriously</title>
      <description>Academics in thrall to formerly "throwaway" literature</description>

      <body>Thousands of comic fans are descending on a small Cumbrian town this weekend for an international festival. Among them will be a growing number of academics who are now taking the art form - previously regarded by many as "throwaway" - as seriously as other literature. With Batman, Superman and The Avengers dominating box offices after making the leap from the page to the big screen, comic-inspired characters have been making a comeback for years. But it is not just cinema-goers who are drawn to the exploits of cartoon creations. Academics are also taking an increasing interest in the world of comics and graphic novels. There are now thought to be about 150 comic scholars in the UK - university lecturers, PhD students and independent researchers. They are exploring how subjects such as gender, feminism, history and mental and physical health are portrayed. Dr Mel Gibson, a comic book expert at Northumbria University, said the genre had "matured" in the 1980s, mainly thanks to British writers such as Bryan Talbot, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. "That's also when academics got involved. But it's not ivory tower stuff, it's rooted in the real world. It has practical applications," she said. Dr Gibson is one of 50 leading figures from the world of graphic novels who will be appearing at the inaugural Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal from Friday until Sunday. With writers, artists and industry figures coming from as far afield as Japan, the United States and Scandinavia, the event promises to transform the picturesque Cumbrian market town. While there are still only a handful of courses across the UK dedicated solely to comics and graphic novels, Dr Gibson says they find their way into many traditional undergraduate subjects. "Some of my final-year students are looking at children's literature and as part of that they will explore comics and graphic novels," she said. "They can even be included in social work studies and paediatric nursing - Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat has been used by health professionals around the world dealing with people who have suffered childhood abuse. "The victims might not want to or be able to talk about their situation, but through the story they can begin a discussion. That's a valuable tool for a health worker to have in their arsenal." The Tale of One Bad Rat, written in 1994, tells the story of a girl who flees London to escape sexual abuse at the hands of her father. "That is the graphic novel I'm most proud of," said Talbot. "I still get people today writing to me to say they were abused and that the book helped them cope." The 61-year-old - a founding patron of the Lakes event - is a doyen of the comic art world. Originally from Wigan, he has lived in Sunderland for the past 15 years with his wife Mary, an academic-turned-graphic novelist, and the pair won the Costa 2012 biography prize after teaming up for Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It was with one of the first British graphic novels, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Talbot made his name in the late 1970s. A story of parallel worlds, it features several nods to the poet William Blake. More recently, 2007's Alice in Sunderland explored the links between the North East city and author Lewis Carroll, mixing myth and history along the way. In recognition of his work, Bryan was given an honorary doctorate by Sunderland University in 2009 while last year he was presented with an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Northumbria University. "Academic interest has grown over the years and I'm proud," he said. "Someone once sent me a PhD thesis they had written about Luther Arkwright and its historical elements. "When I started working in comics it was almost like working at the bottom of the artistic barrel. To most people they were only just more interesting than patterned toilet paper. "Steadily they gained credibility, but that's down to the talent of the writers and illustrators. If the novels weren't any good then no one would be taking any notice of them." Taking inspiration from the annual Angouleme International Comics Festival in France - which draws 250,000 fans - the Lakes event will feature ticketed exhibitions, workshops and panels, as well as a programme of free family-friendly events. Venues across the town will stage sessions, shops are displaying artwork by schoolchildren and college students while the town hall will even replace its Union flag with one bearing the Batman logo. Talbot's latest work, again in partnership with his wife Mary, as well as illustrator Kate Charlesworth, is Sally Heathcote: Suffragette - a tale following a maid-of-all-work and the fight for the vote in Edwardian Britain. For academics such as Dr Gibson, gender is a key area of study. "Sally Heathcote is an example of a strong central female character - something comics are now very good at," she said. "For a while it was forgotten that girls read comics, much less that they were represented within them. "In the 1960s publications such as Jackie featured comic strips, but they disappeared over a period of 20 years and those titles began to steer girls towards magazines like Cosmopolitan rather than comics, which is different to the way boys' reading patterns were shaped." For Dr Gibson the move from a niche, underground offering to graphic novels being seen by many as having mainstream educational appeal is a welcome one. "Graphic novels were once seen as throwaway, but now they are more highly valued and viewed as things which deserve space on the bookshelf." </body>

      <title>Dark secrets of radio broadcaster</title>
      <description>How Michael Souter used his position to prey on boys</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-24460172</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70555000/jpg/_70555252_souter_camo.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>As a boy in Scotland, Michael Souter dreamt of appearing in court - but not in the dock. The man who would later broadcast to thousands for BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde planned to follow in his father's footsteps and become a lawyer. Four decades later he would find himself in court, but as the defendant in a sexual abuse trial. Souter was found guilty of the abuse after a six-week trial at Norwich Crown Court. The court heard he used his local celebrity status to enable him to groom his victims. It marked a remarkable fall from grace for an outwardly respectable man who insisted he was only ever "doing my bit" for the community. The youngest of four boys, Souter grew up in the small town of Lenzie, near Glasgow, attending a "normal, middle-class academy". Aged 17, he joined the Royal Navy on a scholarship, going to the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. "I was supposed to go to university in the third year and study law," he told the court. "The deal was that I would become a barrister. But the Navy decided it didn't need so many barristers so I never became a lawyer." Instead, Souter was sent to the Royal Fleet Auxiliary for four years, serving on supply ships. Quizzed about his sexuality in court, Souter said he was heterosexual but admitted to some "casual" gay encounters while at sea. "That's what happens so often," he said. He continued to serve in the Royal Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander until he turned 55 in 2008. Beginning his broadcasting career at Radio Clyde, Souter moved to the fledgling BBC Radio Norfolk in 1980. "I was supposed to be Radio Norfolk's John Noakes," he told the court. "I was the guy who, if they wanted someone to parachute out of a plane, would be stupid enough to do it." Former colleagues remember him as an able, if brash, broadcaster who did not tend to mix socially with others from the station. Some felt there was something "creepy" about him, even if they did not know exactly what. Souter had been involved with the Scout movement since he was a boy and in 1981 became a leader, setting up a Venture Scout unit for older teenagers and young adults. He also volunteered for Norfolk County Council's Link-Up scheme, mentoring vulnerable youngsters. He said he got involved as a way of building links with the community. However, it was through Scouts and Link-Up that he met several of his victims. Souter owned property in Spain and moved there in 2005 before settling in a bungalow in the small Norfolk town of Loddon. A bachelor, he admitted in police interviews to being "a little bit bisexual", enjoying dressing as a schoolboy to be spanked by older men. The jury also heard that after abuse allegations were made against him in 1993, Souter told a social worker he had no sexual interest in boys. He boasted that married women found him attractive and said he had had a number of affairs. In court he cut a solitary figure, attending and leaving alone each day, pulling a small suitcase behind him. The jury was told his photo collection included many of boys in shorts and uniform, which Souter insisted were innocent, along with a small number of indecent images. Souter said he always carried a camera and took photos of everything, adding that pictures of boys represented only a small part of his collection. He was active, too, on social media. In August he tweeted that he had applied for tickets for next summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. But with Souter now set to face a lengthy jail term, it seems unlikely he will be making the trip back to his home city. </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>Why did it go so wrong at Al-Madinah free school?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70548000/jpg/_70548135_madinah.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Life in the aftermath of a killing</title>
      <description>Murder victims’ families combat stress, hair loss and flashbacks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22966016</url>
      <date>1382000214</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70511000/jpg/_70511384_holly-91.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories. The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one. A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned. The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice. Some people might even use the word "closure". And that, appeals not withstanding, is that. Only it never is like that. The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings. Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported. The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say. This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well. Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries. The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue. Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood. "You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events. "The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family. "One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't." The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness. "During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey. "There isn't a 'closure' with homicide." The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations. And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused. Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done. The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them. This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling. The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help. These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed. Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her. She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died. The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo. It was then that he killed him. Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine. "I lost everything that day," she says. Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress. After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post. Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators. The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster. "There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way. "My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support." Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families. "It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are. "I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it." For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example. Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14. Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk. The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital. "That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with. "I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it. "It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't." Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife. "To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis." Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes. Her ambitions for the law were put on hold. Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be. "I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says. "The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be." Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner. So too is Caroline Shearer. Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September. Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings. Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay. She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind. Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab. "I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says. "He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed." The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again. It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep. And she too had difficulties with eating. She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son. None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod. Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans. But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there. "I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod. "The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is." Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances. They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD. Can these families ever recover? Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now. "It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with." </body>

      <title>Trafficking: why is help refused?</title>
      <description>Why are victims of human trafficking reluctant to seek help?</description>

      <body>In a series of raids on suspected illegal brothels in Birmingham West Midlands Police took five women into protective custody. They are thought have been brought into the UK by traffickers, but why have all the women refused counselling? The phrase 'Stockholm Syndrome' is usually reserved for hostages who in some cases form a powerful, emotional attachment to their captors. But the charities tackling human trafficking say that a number of victims of the trafficking gangs are suffering from symptoms of the Syndrome that was first coined in the 1970s following a bank siege in the Swedish capital. Despite the more obvious reason such as the fear of reprisals from those who enslaved them, West Midlands Police say there are many reasons why victims stay silent. "Victims are exploited in four main ways - forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude and benefit fraud. Those who traffic people may do so by force or coercion," said Det Supt Tim Bacon. "They either do not see themselves as victims, or they may have a suspicion of authorities and a lack of awareness that (authorities) are in a position to help. They also fear traffickers will accuse them of being complicit in their trafficked situation. "Often, there can be a type of Stockholm Syndrome - where due to unequal power, victims create a false emotional or psychological attachment to their controller." Stop The Traffik is a London-based group that works to create and change awareness of the problem. A spokeswoman said: "A lot of women have been groomed into their situation, so there is a huge sense of loyalty to their captors. "For many, it can be the first relationship they have ever had; they have no other frame of reference, and are working for this person 12 hours a day, seven days a week. "But the after-care system for UK victims is not great. "Drop-in venues are available for women who work on the street, but for trafficking victims, behind closed doors, there is none." One trafficking victim who did seek help - and now advises others to do the same - is Svetlana. Free from the abuse of her ordeal, she has used the help and support available to rebuild her life - and now offers that support to others. She said: "At a party when I was 18, a man approached me and started yelling and punching me, saying he was going to take me away. "I was forced into a vehicle and told someone would meet me at the other end. This was in London. "I was forced to take drugs and pictures were taken of me; and that is when I first got a clue what was happening to me. I was forced to work as a prostitute. "Later I was sold to another man for £6,000 and told I would have to work that cost off through prostitution." Despite a fear of her captors, Svetlana plotted her escape at a service station, where she "plucked up the courage" to ask staff for help. She was put in touch with police and the Salvation Army, who work around-the-clock internationally to help identify and support trafficking victims. Major Anne Read, Salvation Army anti-trafficking response co-ordinator, said: "We have the government contract for managing the support for all UK adult trafficking victims. "That means when a victim is rescued, or escapes, they are referred to us to see if they need or want help with medical, legal, or accommodation matters." Friday is Anti-Slavery Day and will see the Salvation Army holding a range of UK-wide events to raise even more awareness of the issue. But for now, the daily nightmare of human trafficking continues for hundreds of powerless victims. </body>

      <body>One of the few remaining survivors of a German prisoner of war camp immortalised in the film The Great Escape has died. Frank Stone, who died aged 91, was taken to Stalag Luft III in Zagan after his bomber crashed in Germany in 1940. The 18-year-old RAF gunner was housed in hut 104, home to 76 airmen who attempted escape via a tunnel in 1944. However, the alarm was raised before Mr Stone, who had helped dispose of soil from the tunnel, could join them. During an interview with the BBC in 2009, Mr Stone, of Hathersage, Derbyshire, said the atmosphere on the night of the escape had been "electric". "It was all very tense - but at 5 o'clock, a shot rang out and we knew they had been discovered." Of the 76 who made their break for freedom using the tunnel, known as Harry, 50 were subsequently shot after being recaptured and only three men managed to get away successfully. Mr Stone said: "It was very sad and we were advised not to make any further attempts to escape." He was finally freed towards the end of the war. His widow, Jane, said: "He gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50. "Frank could never understand why people where so interested in him but they were. We often had to put extra talks on so more people could come." Stalag Luft III, which was 100 miles south-east of Berlin, held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation. In 1947, 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured were put before a military tribunal in Hamburg. Thirteen of them were executed, while the rest received long prison sentences. The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <title>Cognitive therapy 'can ease anxiety'</title>
      <description>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people who have health anxiety or hypochondria, say researchers writing in The Lancet.</description>

      <body>Cognitive behavioural therapy is more effective than standard care for people with hypochondria or health anxiety, say researchers writing in The Lancet. In their study, 14% of patients given CBT regained normal anxiety levels against 7% given the usual care. The researchers say nurses could easily be trained to offer the psychological therapy. Between 10% and 20% of hospital patients are thought to worry obsessively about their health. Previous studies have shown that CBT, which aims to change thought patterns and behaviour, is an effective treatment for other anxiety disorders. But there is a shortage of specialists trained to deliver CBT, and as a result waiting lists can be long. In this study, 219 people with health anxiety received an average of six sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy while 225 received reassurance and support, which is standard. After periods of six months and 12 months, patients in the CBT group showed "significantly greater improvement in self-rated anxiety and depression symptoms" compared with standard care, the study showed. There was also a particularly noticeable reduction in health anxiety in the CBT group straight after treatment began. The therapy was delivered by non-CBT experts who had been trained in only two workshops. Study author Prof Peter Tyrer, head of the Centre for Mental Health at Imperial College London, said the results showed that hypochondria could be successfully treated, in a "relatively cheap" way, by general nurses with minimal training in a hospital setting. Reducing the anxiety levels of 14% of the CBT group might not seem a high figure, he said, but these were often people with serious problems who had sometimes spent thousands of pounds on private health assessments because of fears about their health. "Health anxiety is costly for healthcare providers and an effective treatment could potentially save money by reducing the need for unnecessary tests and emergency hospital admissions," Prof Tyrer said. Writing about the study in The Lancet, Chris Williams from the University of Glasgow and Allan House from the University of Leeds, said the findings were "intriguing" but translating them into services was "problematic". They also questioned the cost-effectiveness of screening patients for health anxiety and CBT. They wrote: "Health anxiety is only one of the problems noted in medical outpatients - depression, hazardous alcohol use, poor treatment adherence, and other forms of medically unexplained presentation all press for recognition and intervention. "To develop multiple parallel services makes no sense, especially since the common emotional disorders overlap substantially." But Prof Tyrer said health anxiety was a hidden epidemic that required the correct treatment, not just reassurance. </body>

      <title>Housework 'not strenuous enough'</title>
      <description>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found.</description>

      <body>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found. It had been thought they could count towards the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense activity per week. But the BMC Public Health study, which surveyed over 4,500 adults, found those who counted housework were heavier than those who did other activities. Experts said activities only counted when they made breathing more rapid and the heart beat faster. NHS recommendations do say housework does not count towards the 150-minute goal. But the researchers in this paper say there has been a move towards promoting a "lifestyle approach" to physical activity - encouraging "domestic" activities in people who may not take part in sports or go to the gym. And they warn that, while any activity is better than none, people should be aware that they still need to meet the moderate activity target on top. Participants completed a detailed interview about their activity levels, whether they played any sports or did formal exercise as well as their diet and smoking and drinking habits. They were particularly asked about activity linked to looking after their homes. Domestic housework in 10 minute bursts or more accounted for 36% of the reported moderate to vigorous physical activity people said they did. But when weight and height were taken into account, researchers found that those who counted housework as exercise were heavier than people doing other exercise for the same amount of time. Among women, just a fifth reached the weekly exercise target if housework was discounted. The research team, which included experts from the Universities of Ulster, Sheffield Hallam and Wolverhampton as well as Sport Northern Ireland concluded: "Domestic physical activity accounts for a significant proportion of self-reported daily moderate to vigorous physical activity particularly among females and older adults. "However such activity is negatively associated with leanness, suggesting that such activity may not be sufficient to provide all of the benefits normally associated with meeting the physical activity guidelines." Prof Marie Murphy, from the University of Ulster, who led the study, said: "Housework is physical activity and any physical activity should theoretically increase the amount of calories expended. "But we found that housework was inversely related to leanness, which suggests that either people are overestimating the amount of moderate intensity physical activity they do through housework, or are eating too much to compensate for the amount of activity undertaken." She added: "When talking to people about the amount of physical activity they need to stay healthy, it needs to be made clear that housework may not be intense enough to contribute to the weekly target and that other more intense activities also need to be included each week." Chris Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Your exercise should make you breathe harder, feel warmer, and make your heart beat faster than usual. "So, unless your household chores tick all these boxes, they won't count. "If you're daunted by the prospect of a 150-minute target, think of it in 10-minute chunks. "It doesn't necessarily mean forking out for a gym membership either - try a brisk walk on your lunch break or make a resolution to take the stairs rather than the lift each morning." </body>

      <title>Poverty gap 'causing unjust deaths'</title>
      <description>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say.</description>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <description>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says.</description>

      <body>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says. The draft guidance is published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). It also suggests obese patients be referred to weight-loss programmes, including those run by commercial companies, to help them lose weight. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes and costs the NHS more than £5bn each year. Just over a quarter of adults in England are classed as obese and a further 41% of men and 33% of women as overweight. The NICE document, which is subject to a three-month consultation, suggests all health professionals dealing with overweight or obese people should monitor their tone in order to "minimise harm". It states all healthcare professionals should "be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese may feel or experience". It adds: "Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is respectful and non-blaming. "The terminology used to describe the person's condition should respect individual preferences." NHS care providers should also ensure equipment and facilities "meet the needs of most adults who are overweight or obese". Those overseeing NHS weight management programmes should tell patients how much weight they can "realistically" expect to lose, and that no programme is a "magic bullet", the document says. Instead, stress should be put on the "importance of making gradual, long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how much weight they might realistically expect to lose in total and on a weekly basis if they adhere to the programme". Prof Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for an individual's health, not only physically with increased risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, but it can also affect their mental health as a result of stigma and bullying or discrimination." He added: "This draft guidance isn't about quick fixes, it is about ensuring lifestyle weight management services support people in the long-term. "Programmes that address diet, activity and behaviour change can help people who are obese lose weight, but they are only cost-effective if the weight is kept off." Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said most health professionals were not trained in how to raise weight issues effectively. "The abrupt style that many have taken so far has only made matters worse," he said. "NICE is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone. But once they've got the tone right and the confidence of the patient, they should really think about tough love. "It's essential that patients realise that the consequences of putting on weight are very serious." Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for your heart health. "However, taking control of your weight can be a daunting task because changing the habits of a lifetime is often a challenge. "That's why it's a good idea to get support throughout your weight loss journey, which could include joining a support group." </body>

      <title>Competition concern stops NHS merger</title>
      <description>Two Dorset NHS hospital trusts will not merge, the Competition Commission rules, in the first decision of its kind.</description>

      <body>Two NHS hospital trusts in Dorset will not merge, the Competition Commission (CC) has decided. The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals and Poole Hospital Trusts wanted to become one to save money. It is the first time the Competition Commission, which normally rules on companies and commercial markets, has intervened in the NHS in England. The trusts said the decision was "fundamentally wrong" and that they would "explore alternative options". In a statement, the trusts added they were "deeply disappointed" and felt the merger was the best option to ensure "high-quality hospital services to local people". "The assessment of the merger was always weighted to put competition ahead of benefits to patients, and we do not believe the NHS is best served in this way. "The two trusts have worked extremely effectively together over the last two years and we will continue to explore areas where we can work in partnership. However, this will not be to the scale we had hoped. "It will be much more difficult to make further savings as individual organisations, but we now need to explore alternative options and work closely with our commissioners as we look to the future." The merger was referred to the commission by the Office of Fair Trading, amid concerns about allowing two competing trusts to combine. The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has 601 beds across two sites, whilst Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has 623 beds across three sites. But the CC said the merger would "damage patients' interests by eliminating competition and choice". Its chairman Roger Witcomb said the organisation was "acutely aware of the pressures facing NHS hospitals". "While the broad aims of the merger are desirable ones, there simply isn't enough detail in the hospitals' plans for us to conclude that any of the claimed benefits are likely to materialise," he said. Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is already being investigated by health sector regulator Monitor amid concerns over its finances and warned it faced a deficit if the planned merger failed. The commission said it did not believe Poole would close as a result of the merger being blocked. A spokesman for the Foundation Trust Network said the decision raised "significant fears about how competition law is being applied within NHS settings and on trusts' ability to make much needed changes to how services are delivered". The NHS Confederation described the decision as a "body blow for change in the NHS". Annette Brooke, the Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, said she was deeply concerned by the decision. "We have a big financial problem at Poole hospital and I think it's really important that it is made financially viable," she said. "One can certainly see there is a logic in merging management across two hospitals that are so close together [and] the bottom line is whether patients actually want choice over better services." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "It's a sad day for the NHS when competition lawyers, and not doctors, are deciding what's best for patients." A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The review of mergers is a matter for the independent competition authorities. They must make their decisions in the best interests of patients." </body>

      <body>The UK medicines watchdog is recalling five drugs produced at an Indian factory where "manufacturing deficiencies" have been found. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is asking chemists and wholesalers to return the medicines made by Wockhardt Limited. The recalled drugs are used for pain relief and to treat type 2 diabetes. The MHRA has stressed there is no risk to patients and people should continue to take their medication as prescribed. The agency's decisions follows a precautionary recall from retail outlets by the manufacturer. It had found problems with the manufacturing process during an inspection of Wockhardt's manufacturing site in Chikalthana, India, in July. They included, poor record keeping relating to the manufacture and testing of the medicines made at the site and inadequate validation and production controls for medicines. The MHRA said it was working with Wockhardt and other international regulators to resolve these issues. The affected medicines are, in most cases, available from alternative manufacturers. Ten prescription-only medicines can continue to be made at the Chikalthana site and used in the UK. The MHRA said even though there were concerns over the continuity of supply, the benefits to patients of continuing to take these medicines outweighed that risk. It said patients did not need to return the medicines they had as there was no evidence they were defective and no evidence of a patient safety risk. But the MHRA said it had to "act in the interests of public health as poor manufacturing standards means that the quality of medicines is not guaranteed". Gerald Heddell, MHRA director of inspection, enforcement and standards, said: "People can be reassured that there is no evidence of a safety risk from the medicines made at Wockhardt's Chikalthana site, so it's important people continue to take their medicines as prescribed. "We are working with the Department of Health to ensure that people have access to the medicines they need. Anyone who has questions should speak to their pharmacist or GP."

      <title>Trust admits child deaths liability</title>
      <description>Belfast Health Trust accepts liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland. Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996. Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down. The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry. Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water. Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995. Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year. She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids. However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs. In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus. The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006. However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust". He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard. During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain. It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging. The public inquiry is also investigating specific issues around the treatment of 15-year-old Conor Mitchell who was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital on 8 May 2003. The following day, the teenager was transferred the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, where he died on 12 May. At Thursday's hearing, the Southern Health Trust admitted that guidelines had not been followed when the teenager was treated in Craigavon Area Hospital and it apologised to his family. However, the Southern Health Trust has not accepted liability for Conor's death. The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made". Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done". Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered. The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals. It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth. The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths. On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson. Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry. She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed. </body>

      <title>UK autism cases have 'levelled off'</title>
      <description>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, following the surge of the 1990s, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, according to researchers. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, said there had been a surge in reported cases in the 1990s, but the rise had not continued. Increased awareness and diagnosis of condition are thought to have contributed to earlier increases. The National Autistic Society said the evidence proved the condition had been around for a long time. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health at University College London looked at GP data which represented 5% of patients in the UK. They used the information to estimate the number of eight-year-olds with autism each year. The annual prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders was estimated at 3.8 per 1,000 boys and 0.8 per 1,000 girls. That figure was stable between 2004 and 2010. The study concluded there was "compelling evidence that a major rise in incidence rates of autism, recorded in general practice, occurred in the decade of the 1990s but reached a plateau shortly after 2000 and has remained steady through 2010". The researchers said changes in the way autism was diagnosed as well as greater awareness among doctors and the public explained some of the rise although "the actual cause [of the rise in the 90s] remains in large part a mystery". The study is in contrast to a report by the US Centre for Disease Control, which reported a 78% rise between 2002 and 2008. The last UK Census, which has data from more people than this study but lacks the yearly analysis of diagnoses, suggested the prevalence of autism was closer to one in 100. Carol Povey, from the National Autistic Society, said: "This study shows that, contrary to media hype, autism has been with us for a long time. "Evidence suggests that the increase in diagnoses of autism is in large part down to greater awareness of the condition, as well as better diagnostic facilities and improved skills and knowledge among those who carry out diagnoses. "More than one in 100 people in the UK have autism and it's important that we work to ensure they receive the support they need to reach their full potential." </body>

      <title>Assisting legal abortion 'not crime'</title>
      <description>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said.</description>

      <body>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said. Barra McGrory made the comments after the BBC was told draft abortion guidelines had caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff. There have been calls for clarity after women carrying babies with fatal foetal abnormalities told their stories. Foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Draft guidelines were published in March, but following a consultation process, revised guidelines are being brought before the Stormont Executive within weeks. Health Minister Edwin Poots has said he would meet the Public Prosecution Service about the potential prosecution of staff involved in an abortion in certain circumstances. He said he was also taking legal advice from other sources. Mr Poots said he had work to do that needed to be handled sensitively and he would not be deflected from it. Mr McGrory told the BBC's Nolan Show said: "There is no criminal offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring someone to have what is a lawful abortion in England," he said. "We can see no circumstances in which anyone would fall foul of the criminal law in that regard." Mr McGrory added: "The circumstances in which you are talking, of these tragic cases of foetal abnormality, where individuals have felt it necessary to travel to England to have an abortion because of serious foetal abnormality, in those circumstances, I can envisage no situation where anyone giving advice and assistance in that regard would fall foul of the law. "You cannot aid or abet or procure something which is not a crime in our law." Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show highlighted the cases of two women, whose babies had fatal foetal abnormality, who were refused terminations in Northern Ireland, Sarah Ewart travelled to England for an abortion because her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. She said the baby's skull was not formed and it was brain dead. Another woman, Laura, who is 22 weeks pregnant with twins who are suffering from the same condition, appealed to Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <title>Blood test 'detects sepsis in hours'</title>
      <description>A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning, or sepsis, at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives, say researchers.</description>

      <body>A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning, or sepsis, at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives, say researchers. Early studies at King's College London suggest the condition can be diagnosed in two hours using a simple blood test. Current diagnostic methods take up to two days, which may delay treatment with life-saving antibiotics. The condition - caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection - causes 37,000 UK deaths each year. In the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers identified a biomarker for diagnosing sepsis rapidly in blood samples. It is based on detecting nucleotides specific to sepsis to rule out similar conditions that can mimic its symptoms. A small study at a London hospital and a larger study in Sweden demonstrated that sepsis could be diagnosed within two hours, with an accuracy of 86%. Lead researcher Prof Graham Lord, director of the NIHR biomedical research centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, told BBC News: "If our early phase result holds up in a large trial, it could have significant effects in saving thousands of lives and reducing the use of unnecessary antibiotics. "If we can prove its value in prospective trials, we can quite rapidly translate it into NHS clinical care." He said more research was needed to be done, but if successful, the test could be available for use in the NHS in about two years. UK Sepsis Trust chairman Dr Ron Daniels said the work paved the way for earlier detection of sepsis. "If we had a simple test that would reliably detect sepsis - particularly in vulnerable groups - it would significantly improve the reliability of the delivery of care," he said. He added: "We still need the suspicion of sepsis to be present for someone to give the test." In September, a report from the health service ombudsman found significant failings in treatment of sepsis and said more had to be done to save the lives of patients. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will produce guidance for GPs and clinicians to help them recognise sepsis at an early stage. </body>

      <title>Call for rugby concussion lessons</title>
      <description>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's former medical advisor says.</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said. The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia. Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players. He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this. He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees. Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players. "They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do." The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB. It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game. In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously". "This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message. "Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers. "Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element." The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board. "We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times." A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team. Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing. He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital. His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch. "At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said. "He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles. "It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today." Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK. And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers. "I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added. "Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children. "We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way." The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research. "Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <body>A Basildon Hospital nurse faces misconduct charges for allegedly using a colleague to run personal errands while on duty. Abiola Olukemi Apara is accused of asking a clinical support worker to mow her lawn, take her car to get an MOT and drive her to Ikea at Lakeside. It is also alleged she instructed another male member of staff to call in sick and drive her to London and back. The Nursing and Midwifery Council is due to hear the case in January. In total, Ms Apara, who worked on the Lionel Cousins ward, faces seven misconduct charges stemming from 2004 to 2007. It is alleged she asked the clinical support worker to do nine tasks for her, including fixing broken locks and leaking taps at her home. Ms Apara is also alleged to have asked him to install her new washing machine, fit new lights and put sealant around her bath. She is also accused of asking a nurse for a reference for her daughter, whom she had not met and did not know, and of shouting at her in front of a patient she was washing. The Conduct and Competence Committee is also due to hear a charge that Ms Apara did not speak to a ward sister for about five weeks and instead left notes for her in the staff room. She also behaved inappropriately to the ward hostess, it is alleged, by shouting at her and not speaking to her for about 17 weeks. </body>

      <title>Seeing in 3D 'possible with one eye'</title>
      <description>The effect of "vivid 3D vision" can be experienced with just one eye, a study by a Scottish university suggests.</description>

      <body>The effect of "vivid 3D vision" can be experienced with just one eye, a study has suggested. Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for 3D technology. The study, published in Psychological Science, also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with double-eye vision. The method was said to create 3D similar to effects used in film-making. Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images - one from each eye - to be combined in the visual cortex, creating a sense of depth. But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the university, believes both eyes are not necessary for this "3D experience". Dr Vishwanath said: "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole). "While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed. "Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies. "Based on this finding, we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the 3D experience might be." The university said the 1838 invention of the stereoscope - the technology behind 3D film-making - brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for 3D vision. Dr Vishwanath said: "This work has significant implications for people who don't have normal binocular vision. "First it could help them experience what it means to see in 3D. Second, it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain two-eye 3D vision (which produces the strongest 3D effect in everyday life) once they can see first-hand what 'seeing in 3D' is really like." Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics, people with misaligned eyes. He said that nearly 15% of the population, including Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, may have some form of misalignment. The psychologist also believes his theory suggests a 3D experience could be induced simply by increasing resolution, using ultra-high definition (4K) televisions. Seeing in 3D with just one eye: Stereopsis without binocular vision is published by Psychological Science. Further research is due to be published later this year. </body>

      <title>Pet dog 'can predict epileptic fit'</title>
      <description>An Irish family say their Great Dane, Charlie, is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24521541</url>

      <body>An Irish family has said their pet dog is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure. The Lynch family, from County Clare, believe their Great Dane, Charlie, can sense changes in their child up to 20 minutes before she has a fit. Brianna Lynch has epilepsy since birth. Her family said Charlie will alert them by walking in circles around Brianna. He also gently pins her against a wall to stop her from falling during a fit. Brianna's condition was picked up when she was three months old. It can lead to traumatic seizures, some of which cause her to go into a trance-like state, while others cause violent convulsions during which she is at risk of falling and hitting her head. Brianna's mother, Arabella Scanlan, said Charlie is not a trained "seizure alert dog" but was just a normal, family pet who appears to have developed some kind of special skill through his own instincts. They first noticed it some time ago when the huge Great Dane began to get agitated and walk in circles around Brianna. Minutes later the toddler had an epileptic fit. "If you see a child having a seizure, it's pretty horrific, it's frightening, it's terrible, it's gut-wrenching," Ms Scanlan said. "Charlie will know about 15 to 20 minutes before she's going into seizure. He'll get ever so panicky and giddy, almost as if you'd think 'this stupid dog is going to knock her over'." In fact, at first the family thought they might have to find another home for their clumsy Great Dane, amid concerns that he would knock the toddler down as a result of his agitation. "He's a big boy - it isn't like he's agile. When Charlie turns the whole room turns with him," Ms Scanlan said. "But he has never once knocked her over." She said the family began to notice a pattern to Charlie's behaviour, with his increased agitation often preceding one of Brianna's fits. "We kept an eye on this and, sure enough, I went into the yard one day and she (Brianna) was buckled over to the side, on top of him (Charlie). She was actually having a seizure. "She was leaning against the wall, bent over him and he just looked at me as if to say 'I don't know what to do'. But he stayed with her, he didn't move." Ms Scanlan said that since then, the dog rarely leaves Brianna's side and will gently pin her up against a wall or other surface if he senses she is about to fit. He will guard the child until help arrives. "I actually don't know the psychology behind it but, no shadow of a doubt, people are mesmerised when they see him in action. It would actually melt your heart to see them together," she added. Scientific studies have established that some dogs can be trained to "sniff out" cancers and detect low blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, but to date, there is no conclusive scientific proof that canines have an ability to predict human epileptic seizures. UK charities such as Support Dogs and Medical Detection Dogs train dogs to assist people with a variety of medical conditions. The Sheffield-based charity, Support Dogs, trains "seizure alert dogs" which it says can "give between 10-55 minutes warning prior to an oncoming seizure". Medical Detection Dogs chief executive Dr Claire Guest has personal experience of the animals' ability to detect serious illness. She was training dogs to recognise cancers, when she said one of them "started to warn her". She subsequently discovered she had an early stage breast tumour. Dr Guest said it had been established that dogs could detect human odour changes in cancer and diabetes patients but said it was not yet clear how some dogs could predict epileptic fits. She said it could be triggered by smell, but the dogs could also be responding to visual signals. It is certain that not all dogs showed signs of ability to detect illness and disease. Dr Guest said it was usually found in highly expressive dogs that were very attentive to humans and showed a general concern to protect their owners from harm. She added that most scientific studies had been initially sparked by "anecdotal reports" from pet owners who noticed a pattern of behaviour in their dogs, but said the area would benefit from more research. In 2003, findings from a preliminary study published in Seizure, European Journal of Epilepsy, suggested that "some dogs have innate ability to alert and/or respond to seizures". The study added that the success of these seizure alert dogs "depends largely on the handler's awareness and response to the dog's alerting behaviour". Charlie and Brianna's story was first reported in their local paper, the Clare Champion. The family are fundraising to a buy a new electroencephalography (EEG) machine for University Hospital Limerick, in order to accurately diagnose their daughter's condition. </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>
      <date>1382063225</date>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military instillations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic is a mineral and as a poison it is almost unrivalled. It is tasteless, dissolves in hot water and it takes less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, it was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And arsenic - the murderer's friend - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <description>Draft guidelines on abortion in NI 'worry medical staff'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24550586</url>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician. Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine. He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines. He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality. Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law. Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March. He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive". Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health. Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines." He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations." The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland. He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother." However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines". "There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years. "Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail." However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved". Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law." He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus. He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby". "Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not. "We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added. </body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Where deadly hyenas are used to treat mental illness</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Millions of people around the world have learned CPR on a mannequin known as Resusci Anne. The story of the 19th Century beauty behind the model - or at least, one version of it - will be told at a symposium in London to mark European Restart a Heart Day. But does anyone really know anything about her? The Lorenzi workshop is a small haven of peace and antiquity in the busy Parisian suburb of Arcueil. And it's the last of its kind. Downstairs the mouleurs, or cast-makers, create figurines, busts and statues, pouring plaster into moulds in much the same way they have since the family business started in the 1870s. But if you want to be face-to-face with history, pick your way up the dusty wooden stairs to a room above the workshop. It's an unsettling experience. Hanging all around you in the narrow attic are life and death masks of poets and artists, politicians and revolutionaries: Napoleon, Robespierre, Verlaine, Victor Hugo, the robust, impatient face of the living Beethoven and the sallow, diminished features of the composer's death mask. Yet, surprisingly, of all the visages of the great and the good on display at Lorenzi's, the best-seller is the mask of a young woman. She has a pleasant, attractive face, with the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Her eyes are closed but they look as if they might spring open at any moment. Hers is the one mask that has no name. She's known simply as the Inconnue, the unknown woman of the Seine. This is how her story goes. Some time in the late 19th Century, the drowned body of a young woman was recovered from the River Seine. As was customary in those days, her body was put on display at the Paris mortuary, in the hope that someone would recognise and identify her. The pathologist on duty became so entranced by the face of the girl with the enigmatic half-smile that he asked a moulder to take a plaster cast of her face. Before long the mask began to appear for sale outside the mouleurs' workshops on the Left Bank and soon the young woman's face became a muse for artists, novelists and poets, all eager to weave imagined identities and stories around the mystery woman, this drowned Mona Lisa. Over the years Rilke, Louis Aragon, Man Ray and Vladimir Nabokov successively fell under the Inconnue's spell and at one time no fashionable European drawing room was complete without a mask of the Inconnue on the wall. One of the first stories featuring her was the 1899 novella The Worshipper of the Image by Richard le Gallienne, who portrays the mask as a malevolent force which bewitches and ultimately destroys a young poet. Other authors have been kinder, many of them telling the story of an innocent young woman from the country who comes to Paris, who's seduced by a rich lover and then abandoned when she falls pregnant. With nobody to turn to, she drowns herself in the waters of the Seine, a modern Ophelia. At the mortuary, her beautiful face, now peaceful in death, is preserved forever with a plaster cast. It was another drowning - or near-drowning - that ensured the Inconnue a place in medical history. In 1955 Asmund Laerdal saved the life of his young son, Tore, grabbing the boy's lifeless body from the water just in time and clearing his airways. Laerdal at that time was a successful Norwegian toy manufacturer, specialising in making children's dolls and model cars from the new generation of soft plastics. When he was approached to make a training aid for the newly-invented technique of CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the combination of chest compressions and the kiss of life which can save the life of a patient whose heart has stopped - his son's brush with death a few years earlier made him very receptive. He developed a torso or whole-body mannequin which simulates an unconscious patient requiring CPR. Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents' house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you're one of the 300 million people who's been trained in CPR, you've almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue's. Through Resusci Anne, students of first aid have for more than 50 years been trying to bring back to life the young woman from the Seine. But was the Inconnue actually dead in the first place? Is that peaceful face really a death mask or was it taken from a live model? When a few years ago I was making a Radio 4 programme about the Inconnue with the novelist Louise Welsh, we decided to show the mask to the men and women who specialise in recovering drowned bodies from the Seine - the Paris river police, known as the Brigade Fluviale. Sitting in the wheelhouse of one of the brigade's boats moored at their headquarters near the Pont d'Austerlitz, Chief Brigadier Pascal Jacquin was less than convinced that the girl was dead when the mask was made. "It's surprising to see such a peaceful face," he said. "Everyone we find in the water, the drowned and suicides, they never look so peaceful. They're swollen, they don't look nice." Over the centuries, artists and writers may have used the stories of Ophelia and the Lady of Shallot to portray drowning as a romantic and peaceful death but Pascal knows from years of dredging bodies out of the Seine that the truth is very different. Even suicides fight for life at the last moment and their faces betray that struggle. And the process of decomposition starts much more quickly in water too. This woman, he remarked, "looks like she's just asleep and waiting for Prince Charming to come". Like so many others before him, Jacquin's imagination had been piqued by the young woman's face and he had already begun to weave a tale of his own around the closed eyes, that secretive little smile and the enigma of the Inconnue. Other experts we consulted seemed to agree that the Inconnue seemed just too healthy, too vital for the mask to have been taken from a corpse. At the workshop in Arcueil, Michel Lorenzi, the current proprietor, is mystified by people's fascination with the Inconnue. "This doesn't look to me like the face of a dead person. It's very hard to maintain a smile while a cast is being taken so I think she was a professional, a very good model." For me the story has two postscripts. The first came a few weeks after the programme was broadcast in 2009. I was visiting Edward Chambre Hardman's photographic studio in Liverpool, the National Trust's perfectly preserved time capsule from the first half of the 20th Century, where anyone who was anyone in Liverpool sat for a portrait with Hardman. Seeing the mask of the Inconnue on the wall of his waiting room, I asked the guide, disingenuously, who the young woman was. Without hesitating she told me the story of two sisters, identical twins, who'd been born in Liverpool more than a century ago. One of them, she said, had embarked on a love affair with a rich suitor and eloped to Paris, never to be seen again. Many years later the other sister had visited Paris on holiday. Walking down a street she was shocked to see the mask of the drowned Inconnue hanging outside the mouleurs' workshops. She had instantly recognised the girl as her long-lost twin, condemned - or blessed - to remain forever young, while her sister grew old. I was captivated by the story. Once again, a tapestry of imagination had been woven around the enigma of the Inconnue and in this case it had been given a Liverpool twist. The other postscript comes from an Oxford-based artist called John Goto. Several years ago he decided to create his own fiction for the Inconnue. He constructed an apparently factual account of detective work and a trail of clues leading to the discovery of a turn-of-the-century carte de visite in a Buenos Aires junk shop. This and other evidence supposedly proved finally and beyond doubt the identity of the Inconnue - she was as a Hungarian actress named Ewa Lazlo, who was murdered by her lover, Louis Argon. Goto put the story and its "supporting evidence" online and moved on to other projects. It was intriguing, therefore, to come across details of this week's London symposium for European Restart a Heart Day. During the day a series of speakers share the latest research on improving survival rates after cardiac arrest. But in the evening entertainment is provided by the ensemble Mulberry Hawk. They're putting on a performance which, according to the blurb, "tells the story of Ewa Lazlo who became the inspiration for the face of Resusci Anne, the first CPR training manikin, and the most kissed girl in the world". So, I thought, Ewa is beginning to take on a life of her own. In fact several websites and blogs are quoting as fact that she's the Inconnue. Goto admits to feeling a little uncomfortable with his creation. "I'd assumed that people would have a postmodern view and treat it as fictional," he told me. "I really didn't expect them to take it seriously." But even if Ewa is an object lesson in not believing quite everything you read on the internet, it's unlikely that the story will go much further. What we love about the Inconnue is the uncertainty, the enigma. As Louise Welsh remarked when we returned from recording our search for this drowned Mona Lisa in Paris, the mask's value lies in its mystery. "The moment we have a name, a life story, that mystery is dead." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>How much better is standing up than sitting?</title>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The lettings group said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. </body>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is $6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in place in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural towns in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those towns. The Scottish towns are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." The UK most now secure approval for the expanded scheme from the EC, which is expected to announce its decision next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander added. The 10 towns selected for the application have higher pump prices than in locations that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's First Minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>
      <description>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.</description>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Brazilian oil workers on strike</title>

      <body>Oil production in Brazil has been disrupted by a strike against a planned auction for rights to explore a huge offshore oilfield near Rio de Janeiro. Union leaders say 90% of employees of the state oil company, Petrobras, joined the strike on Thursday. Forty-two platforms and several refineries have been affected. The unions say the Libra oilfield auction will damage national interests by allowing foreign companies to share production rights with Petrobras. They have taken legal action to try to halt the sale, which is due to take place on Monday. The 40,000 Petrobras employees are also demanding a pay rise and changes to plans to have some of the services contracted out to private companies. "Our aim is not to hurt the population, but we will carry on with the strike for an indefinite period, until our demands are met," said José Antonio de Moraes, president of the Unified Federation of Oil Workers (FUP). In a statement, Petrobras said it had taken "all the measures needed to guarantee operations and the supply of products to the market". There were demonstrations outside the Petrobras headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao could not reach his ministry, which was surrounded by demonstrators. "The country understands the strikes. I regret I was not able to work today. But these things happen," he said. Mr Lobao said that the auction will go ahead as planned on Monday despite the industrial action. Petrobras and six foreign companies are taking part: China National Petroleum Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Colombia's Ecopetrol, , France's Total, China National Offshore Oil Corporation and a consortium made up of Spain's Repsol and China's Sinopec . The Libra field is a deepwater oilfield in the Santos basin, some 230km (140 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It belongs to the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) and is part of huge oil reserves discovered in 2010 under a layer of rock, sand and salt beneath the seabed. The government estimates "the volume of recoverable oil belonging to the nation could vary from 3.7 billion to 15 billion barrels, with the most likely estimate being 7.9 billion barrels". National Petroleum Agency president Magda Chambriard said she expected production to peak in Libra at 1.4 million barrels a day in a decade. </body>

      <body>At least 40 people were arrested after a protest at a shale gas development in the Canadian province of New Brunswick turned violent, say police. A shot was fired, petrol bombs were tossed and police cars torched at the blockade near the town of Rexton. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said arrests were made for firearms violations, threats and intimidation. Protesters have blockaded a staging area where an energy firm stores its equipment since 30 September. Violence erupted as officers moved in to enforce a court injunction won by the company to remove the protesters' highway camp, said police. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officials say at least five of their vehicles were set on fire and destroyed, Molotov cocktails were hurled at officers, and at least one shot was fired by someone who was not a police officer. SWN Resources, owned by Houston-based Southwestern Energy, is exploring the coastal province for shale gas. The reserves are removed from the ground by a controversial practice known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Opponents of the shale gas sector say drinking water can be polluted during this extraction process. The protesters, including regional First Nations, want SWN's seismic testing to stop. "There have been threats made to employees who were working with a private security firm at the site, as well as firearms offences, incidents of intimidation, mischief and other criminal behaviour," RCMP spokeswoman Constable Jullie Rogers-Marsh said in a statement. "For those reasons, and to ensure public safety, police action was required." Among those arrested on Thursday were members of the Elsipogtog First Nation, including their Chief, Arren Sock, Canadian media reported. Former Elsipogtog chief Susan Levi-Peters told the Globe and Mail newspaper the RCMP vehicles had been set on fire after Mr Sock and several other tribal members were arrested while trying to intervene. A councillor from the Elsipogtog First Nation told the Canadian Press news agency that police had used pepper spray on the protesters. "They sprayed the crowd that was there," Robert Levi said. "The chief was manhandled a little bit and all hell broke loose." He added the protesters would try to stay, despite the injunction. "This is what our people have been fighting for," Mr Levi said. </body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation. He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose". Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future". The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues." Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns. The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said. He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs." "Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future." NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future. Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments. She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away." Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made. "We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said. She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable. The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age. A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out. He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement." </body>

      <body>Retail sales grew by 0.6% in September compared with the previous month, following an unexpected fall in August. The Office for National Statistics also said sales volumes had risen by 2.2% compared with September 2012, despite a fall of sales in supermarkets. The retail sales figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 UK retailers. The performance of the retail industry is seen as an indicator of the wider economy and the strength of consumer spending. Furniture sales provided the biggest driver for the monthly rise in sales, owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Sales volumes in household goods stores grew by 3%. Retail sales have see-sawed in recent months. In July, the fine summer weather pushed sales up higher than expected, with barbecue food selling well. Then, a month later, consumers reined in spending, particularly on food, leading to a drop in sales volumes. In September, analysts had expected a rebound, but not to the degree seen in the latest official figures. In addition to household goods, sales at clothing, footwear and textile retailers increased by 1.2% compared with August. Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said although confidence was rising, growth in wages remained "stubbornly low", so many consumers were "yet to benefit" from having more money. He said pressure was on for retailers to get their product and brand "exactly right". "Those who deliver highly desirable and creative products with distinctive and well-understood branding continue to reap the rewards," Mr Geddes added. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said he expected recovery in the housing market to "start to show up shortly". But he said wages would have to rise before a more sustainable recovery could happen. "We would not be surprised to see some softer patches in retail spending ahead," he added. </body>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <title>Labour plans levy on payday lenders</title>
      <description>Labour pledges to introduce a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support credit unions and other low-cost borrowing alternatives.</description>

      <body>Labour has pledged to impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support lower-cost lending from credit unions and boost money advice services. If elected in 2015, it would introduce an extra charge on the lenders, which charge up to 4,000% interest, on top of fees already paid by all finance firms. Shadow business minister Stella Creasy told the BBC it was "payback time for these payday lenders". Payday lenders say they provide a valuable service to their customers. But Ms Creasy, who became Labour's shadow consumer and competition minister in the recent reshuffle, said: "Some of these companies are making a million pounds a week. "They need to pay their share for the damage they're doing." She said the firms were "aggressively targeting people, and once they've got them in their claws, they keep squeezing and squeezing them". Ms Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, added: "Many other industries have set up voluntary organisations, like Drink Aware and Gambling Aware, when their products are causing problems. Yet this industry sits around saying there's no damage being done. "These companies need to take responsibility for the damage that they are causing in communities like mine, where I've got 18 of these companies on my high street alone. "So we're proposing to put a levy on them that can be used to fund the expansion of credit unions, who need more capital to be able to lend, and also debt and money advice services to help people with their finances, because we are struggling with the cost of living in this country." Ms Creasy's interview preceded a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband, in which he said the measure was designed to help those already in "desperate need" and people at risk of racking up huge debts they cannot repay in future. The industry has been referred to the Competition Commission and regulators have promised a tightening of the rules, with all borrowers set to be offered an "affordability" check before being given a loan. Mr Miliband claimed that the squeeze on living standards was causing a "personal debt crisis" with a third of those taking out payday loans currently doing so to meet the cost of heating their homes. "The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid," he said on a visit to south London. "For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch." Labour has already said it will cap the cost of credit and give local authorities new powers to limit the spread of payday lending shops in town centres. But Mr Miliband added: "We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders. "And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight, accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available." He said the party would consult on the rate of the levy and how it will be implemented. Payday lenders, along with all financial service providers, already pay fees to the Financial Conduct Authority to help fund services such as debt advice. The government currently spends £13m on supporting the growth of credit unions but Labour says these organisations do not have the capacity nor the resources to offer help to all those who need it. Labour says the "explosion" in the payday lending market - with it says has doubled in size to £2.2bn in the last four years - is directly related to what it says is a "cost of living crisis". As many as five million families plan to borrow money from payday lenders in the next six months, and more than 1.5 million households spend more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, it says. Ministers say proposals announced by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month, including a ban on some products and a limit on the times loans can be rolled over, will "call time" on unscrupulous lenders. The Church of England has condemned the practices and ethics of some payday lenders and pledged to launch its own credit service to force many of them out business. But lenders say they are helping people in genuine need with no-one else to turn to and that firms who are members of Consumer Finance Association are heavily regulated already. </body>

      <title>Work 'may be no way out of poverty'</title>
      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553611</url>
      <date>1382021987</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70520000/jpg/_70520993_68329107.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month fell by 41,700 to 1.35 million. The unemployment rate drops to 7.7%, down from 7.8% the previous quarter. The number of people in work, both full-time and part-time, reached a record high of 29.87 million in the quarter, up 155,000. The ONS looks at demand for full-time work and whether part-time workers would rather work longer hours. It said almost 1.5 million people were part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The unemployment rate has become a key economic indicator for the Bank of England which, under its recently appointed new governor, Mark Carney, is targeting the unemployment rate. It says it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until it falls to 7%. The ONS also reported average earnings rose by 0.8% in the year to August. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym points out this increase in regular pay (excluding bonuses) equalled the lowest recorded in the history of this series. He adds that the fall of 0.1% in average earnings in the public sector over the year to August was the first time such a decrease had been recorded. There was a sharp difference in the number of men and women in part-time employment, with male part-timers increasing by 21,000 and women in part-time work falling by 13,000. But more women were finding full-time work than men, with male full-time employment up by 69,000 compared with a rise of 79,000 for women. Youth unemployment remains just below the one-million mark, with 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds, down by 1,000 over the quarter. The number of people unemployed for more than a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. Those without work for between six months to a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000, but there was a fall of 32,000 people unemployed for up to six months, leaving 1.1 million in that position. The worst affected areas in the UK were in Birmingham Ladywood where the unemployment rate stands at 11.4% and in West Belfast where it is 9.3%. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the figures were "good news". He added: "These are welcome figures. Of course, we all want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income increased. But the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people's taxes." The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Mr Cameron should admit that there was "a cost-of-living crisis in this country". Mr Miliband said: "Today's economic figures show a welcome fall in unemployment. They also show that prices have risen faster than wages and that is 39 out of 40 months that living standards have fallen since he became prime minister." The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the jobs data showed the recovery was "job-lite". The IoD's chief economist, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: "Today's labour market figures are not surprising. Just as employment losses during the recession were lower than expected, so too are employment gains with recovery. This isn't a jobless recovery but it is a job-lite one." The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) gave a cautious welcome to the figures. Its chief economist, David Kern, said: "Although concerns remain over youth and long-term employment, the figures show that Britain's labour market is strong and flexible, and that the economy should record satisfactory growth in the third quarter. The large fall in inactivity is particularly pleasing, as more people are returning to the workforce and are looking for jobs." He added that he expected the unemployment rate to continue to fall steadily and that the 7% unemployment rate targeted by the Bank of England would be reached in the autumn of 2015, a year earlier than the Bank had indicated. </body>

      <title>Warning of future UK power shortages</title>
      <description>The UK power system is likely to be stretched "close to its limits" in the coming years, a new report warns.</description>

      <body>There is a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years, according to a report commissioned for the prime minister. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is particularly expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Last week the National Grid warned of a higher risk of blackouts this winter. The new study was commissioned by the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology to find out how stretched power supplies are likely to be during this decade. "Although the electricity supply is expected to be sufficient to cover predicted levels of demand, it is likely to stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 2014-15," the report said. Dr John Roberts, one of its authors, added: "We've looked back at real events that happened in the past which caused shocks to our system - like very cold winters, like major power stations shutting down. "If those things happen again in the future and we don't take measures to correct what's going on, then there's a serious risk that we will have power shortages." To avoid what its authors called "a blackout scenario by 2020", the report called on ministers to: Reacting to the report, Business Minister Michael Fallon said: "The lights are not going to go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done. "We've opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You're going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations." Two years ago the UK had a buffer between energy supply and demand of 16%, but this winter that will fall to 5% and it could hit 2% by 2015, according to the National Grid and the energy regulator, Ofgem. </body>

      <title>Numbers relying on food banks triple</title>
      <description>The number of people relying on food banks to survive has tripled over the last year, according to figures from the Trussell Trust.</description>

      <body>The number of people relying on food banks to survive has tripled over the last year, according to new figures. The Trussell Trust, which runs 400 food banks across the UK, said it handed out supplies to more than 350,000 people between April and September this year. A third of those being helped were children, and a third needed food following a delay in the payment of benefits. A cross-party group of MPs has been set up to investigate the surge in demand. The Labour MP Frank Field, appointed by David Cameron as the government's poverty advisor, will head up the committee along with Conservative Laura Sandys. Mr Field said they would investigate the impact of benefit of cuts, low wages and high food prices. The Trussell Trust said the problem was so severe that some people using food banks have started to hand back items that need cooking, as they cannot afford to use the energy. The Trust is calling for a public enquiry into why so many people are having difficulty feeding themselves. "The level of food poverty in the UK is not acceptable," said Chris Mould, the Trust's executive chairman. "It's scandalous, and it is causing deep distress to thousands of people, " he added. Food banks work through a system of referrals. Professionals including doctors and social workers hand out vouchers, which in the first instance can be exchanged for three days' worth of emergency food. The Trust said that the problem of hunger in the UK is getting worse. Rising living costs and stagnant wages are forcing more people to live on a "financial knife edge", it said. It also forecast that rising energy prices this winter are likely to see more people "choosing between heating and eating." It admits that one reason for the rise in the numbers is that there are twice as many food banks in existence as last year. But the Trust says the number of people using them has still tripled, and that even the well-established food banks are reporting significant rises in their use. It claims that problems with benefit payments is a major factor. "We're talking about mums not eating for days because they've been sanctioned for seemingly illogical reasons," said Mr Mould. "Or people leaving hospital after a major operation to find that their benefits have been stopped or delayed," he added. However the government has taken issue with the report. "The Trussell Trust itself says it is opening three new food banks every week, so it's not surprising more people are using them," said a government spokesperson. On the matter of benefit payments, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said that there was "no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks". It also said that benefit processing times have steadily improved over the past five years, with 90% now being paid within 16 days. There was further evidence of increased demand for food hand-outs from FareShare, an organisation which distributes supplies to more than 1000 charities across the UK. It said requests for its services had risen by 15% over the last year. The supermarket giant Tesco has now agreed to donate all its fresh surplus food to FareShare, so providing 7 million meals a year to those who need them. </body>

      <title>Cuts and tax rises in Irish budget</title>
      <description>The Irish government announces spending cuts and tax rises worth 2.5bn euros (£2.1bn) in what it hopes will be the final Irish budget of the IMF bailout era.</description>

      <body>The Irish government has announced spending cuts and tax rises worth 2.5bn euros (£2.1bn) in what it hopes will be the final budget of the bailout era. A number of social welfare benefits are to be withdrawn or reduced. A grant to help with funeral costs and a telephone allowance for pensioners have been cut. The price of a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes will both increase from midnight by 10 cents (8p). The opposition accused the government of targeting the elderly in the budget. The savings measures include a review of the Irish medical card system, which entitles eligible people to access certain health services free of charge. The government said it aims to save 113m euros (£95m) by removing all "ineligible and redundant" medical cards, but the opposition said the changes would mean many pensioners would lose access to free health care. There will also be greater restrictions on sickness benefit - the number of days a person must report sick from work before they are eligible to claim will double from three to six days. Maternity benefit is being "standardised" for new claimants, in a move the government said will save 30m euros (£25m) over the next year. However, the government is introducing free GP care for all children under five years of age, and has set aside 37m euros (£31m) to provide this new benefit. The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, said the medical card changes would badly affect 35,000 pensioners and accused the minister of "robbing grandparents so he can give free GP care to their grandchildren". There will be no change to the state pension, child benefit or carers' allowances, and pensioners will still be entitled to free public transport and TV licences. Finance Minister Michael Noonan said his government was "100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate". The Irish coalition had come under pressure from Europe to raise the business tax in the aftermath of the international bailout. But Mr Noonan said the Republic of Ireland's corporation tax rate was a "settled policy" and "will not change". The Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an 85bn euros (£72m) international bailout in November 2010. At the weekend, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told his annual party conference the Republic of Ireland was on track to exit the bailout programme by December. Mr Noonan introduced his budget by saying: "The story of insolvent Ireland is familiar to all our people and the sacrifices people have had to make in recent years are well known. He said financial assistance from the IMF and the European authorities "came at a high price" as Ireland had "lost its sovereignty". However, he said that Tuesday's budget was the first since 2007 to be delivered against a backdrop of rising employment. "By the time the majority of the measures that I have announced today become law on the first of January next, I am confident that Ireland will have left the EU/IMF programme. "We will have closed this chapter of Ireland's history that began for most of us with the governor of the Central Bank announcing to the Irish public that the country would be forced to turn to the lenders of last resort. "There will be no promissory notes, there will be no Anglo Irish Bank and there will be no bank guarantee. We will have exited the programme and Ireland will have been handed back her purse." Mr Noonan added: "We are well along the recovery path and it is time now, as a nation, to begin to look forward." Fianna Fáil finance spokesperson, Michael McGrath, said: "We all hope the country is on the cusp of recovery but I believe it is too early too early to draw any definitive conclusions on that front." He said: "This is a budget that targets the elderly, it targets those who hold medical cards, it targets young mothers, it abandons people struggling to kept their home, and yet again, incredibly, the government has gone out of its way to insulate the better off from the worst affects of this budget". Mr McGrath criticised the withdrawal of the 850 euros (£718) bereavement grant and said the way that pensioners in particular had been treated in the budget was "nothing short of disgraceful". "Not only will many of them now lose their medical card, they will have higher prescription charges, they will lose their telephone allowance, their bereavement grant is gone and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is going up. "Even the dead, minister, are not safe from this government. As if it isn't enough to take a property tax from the estate of those who are deceased, but the modest grant that their loved one gets to given them the dignity of a decent burial is now being removed by this government," Mr McGrath added. </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>

      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan. Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van. "It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home. "I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this." Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months. His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals. Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed. And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area. "I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says. He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes. "It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham. "I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly." In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's". To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate. Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week." To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors". "I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'. "I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman. "What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful. "We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us." But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose. "I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go." Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit. The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum. Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years. But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success. "The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying." Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing. "I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends. "And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck." Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role. "It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says. "The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else." Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive. Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff. "I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that." </body>

      <title>Do sweat the small stuff</title>
      <description>Experts say paying attention to small details is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones.</description>

      <body>Jan Smits is standing in his hotel room staring at his watch and he's not very happy. But Mr Smits is no ordinary guest. He's the Asia, Middle East and Africa chief executive of International Hotels Group (IHG), the world's largest hotel chain. On a trip to India to see how young graduates are trained within the company he has just realised that the time taken to prepare the hotel rooms for bedtime - the so-called turndown service - is not standardised. At the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Rohini the process of turning down the duvet cover and closing the curtains took five minutes, but it should only take two minutes. It seems surprising that someone so senior, a member of the firm's executive committee, is concerned about this kind of small detail which one would assume would fall squarely under the remit of housekeeping. But for IHG, like all businesses, time equals money. If a regular process such as this takes longer than it should, then repeated 678,000 times for each of its rooms worldwide, the extra time spent would be significant and ultimately costly. But it's not only crucial for financial reasons, but so that a guest, whether they are staying at a Crowne Plaza in India or America, has the same experience each time. Mr Smits says IHG uses so-called "standard operating procedures" to ensure this level of standardisation. These outline every single step involved in any regular process, such as a turndown or checking a guest into the hotel, to ensure it is both efficient and consistently creates the same end result. "From my experience here tonight there's just a little bit more room to make sure it's exactly the same across all the Crowne Plazas. We're very close but it can't be very close. it needs to be the same each time to create a great brand," he says. While it may appear obsessive, experts argue paying attention to these kinds of details is not only important, but is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones. That's because creating a standard and consistent experience can be a good way of making customers loyal to a particular brand. "Ultimately it drives customer loyalty and repeat business. As long as it's an enjoyable experience people tend to go to what they know even when they're in another country," says Bridget McVerry, a principal at management consultancy Oliver Wyman where she focuses on the retail sector. She points to fast food chain McDonald's as an example. "You know what you're going to get and not just from a product point of view, but from the overall experience," she says. Recent research by Oliver Wyman in the US found that differences in customer experience were the reason behind one quarter to one third of the variation in sales and profits of individual shops within a chain. Improving the consistency of the customer experience drove sales improvements of 10% or more. And it's not just a good way of creating loyal customers, it can help create loyal employees: retail chains which focused on providing a consistent customer experience - where employees knew what they were supposed to do and were given the training and tools to do it - had staff turnover rates 50% or more below industry norms. Given the very real difference the research shows that focusing on the customer experience can have, Ms McVerry believes that it's something chief executives should be involved with, at least initially in terms of defining what she calls their "mantra'"- the experience that the business wants to deliver to its customers. Of course, the more branches a firm has the harder it can be to ensure customers have the same experience each time they visit. Coffee chain Starbucks has more than 19,000 stores worldwide, including 730 in the UK, and while Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing at Starbucks UK, admits that being consistent can be hard, he says customer feedback indicates it is important. "One of the things they value most about Starbucks is the friendly, personal service and the consistent high quality coffee. They are just not willing to take a risk on a poor experience or product when they have just a few moments on their morning commute or school run," he tells the BBC. To ensure that customers' experiences are the same, whether they order their coffee in London or Manchester, Mr Cranna says all new Starbucks staff are trained in its cultures and values before they are let anywhere near a coffee machine. These cultures and values - which include making the coffee shops a "third place" for customers away from home and work - are the same in each of the 60 countries in which it operates. "The culture and values are fundamentally important, with straightforward functional training alone it would be very hard to maintain the high quality consistent experience we strive to offer," he says. As IHG's Mr Smits says: "The devil is in the detail. You have to be very disciplined and empower your leaders to make it happen."

      <body>Italian football club Inter Milan has become the latest European club to be taken over by foreign investors. A trio of Indonesian businessmen led by media tycoon Erick Thohir have bought a 70% stake in the club. The club did not disclose the value of deal, but various reports estimated it to be between 250m - 300m euros ($340m; £210m - $405m; £250m). The two sides had been negotiating for some time amid efforts by the club to bring in fresh capital. Massimo Moratti, the president of the club, said the club's "history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes". "The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future," he added in a statement. Mr Thohir is also a co-owner of DC United, a Major League Soccer club in the US and has also served as vice president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee. The other two partners in the deal are Rosan Roeslani and Handy Soetedjo. Mr Roeslani also owns a stake in DC United, while Mr Soetedjo was involved in the purchase of basketball team Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2011. </body>

      <title>Evans to give up Pirates ownership</title>
      <description>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans is to stand down at the end of the season, but will continue to help fund the team.</description>

      <body>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans has announced plans to step aside at the end of the season, but insists he will continue to help finance the team. The 67-year-old plans to sell 150 shares in the club and has committed to providing £400,000 in funding on a two-year rolling basis. The businessman has been involved at the Pirates since 1994. "We need to alter the ownership of the club in readiness for the next push as I'm not getting younger," said Evans. In a lengthy statement on the Cornish Pirates website,   Evans laid out his vision for the future of the club over the next few years and explained his decision to change the ownership model. "I have to think of my family for a change, four people who have been incredibly supportive of me," he added. "I intend to step aside, not down, at the end of the season as the owner of the company and hand over ownership to the many superb friends and supporters who follow the team. "Consequently, over the next eight months to the end of this current financial year we need to develop a plan to enable friends and supporters of the Cornish Pirates worldwide to take ownership through a basic share issue format. "They will be taking over a company clear of all loans and debt - paying a nominal £1 for the whole shareholding." The Pirates have risen up the leagues to the Championship during Evans' time at the club, but have so far found the ultimate prize of a place in the Premiership frustratingly out of reach. Evans said the need to move to a stadium in a more central location in Cornwall - ideally in Truro - was a key hurdle for the club to clear in order to progress and increase their fanbase. The pursuit of a larger stadium in Truro has been a long-running issue for the Pirates, who are currently based at Mennaye Field in Penzance in the far south-west of the county. The club have led a nomadic existence in recent seasons having played at Kenwyn near Truro and at Camborne during the last decade. "This is the next major step in securing our future," added Evans. "The stadium will come eventually and it's essential that the Cornish Pirates are in a position to move to the centre of Cornwall and consolidate on the business and spectator support available there, witnessed by the year we spent at Kenwyn - our most successful year at this level financially. "The rugby will be of the highest calibre possible within the budget constraints that are always with us and the party atmosphere will continue both home and away. "Cornish people deserve a top-class sporting team and venue - we have the ability to produce the former and as each obstacle to a stadium is surmounted there is no doubt that will come. "The Pirates are a vital part of this dream - let's not let it go down the tubes." Evans also plans to offer some "iconic players" and coaches Ian Davies and Harvey Biljon long-term contracts until the end of the 2015-16 season as part of a commitment to working closely with the wider Cornish rugby community. "Hopefully we can work with the senior Cornish clubs such as Redruth and Launceston to provide our qualified coaches on an almost full-time basis," he said. "At the same time we can work with these clubs to lend them Pirates squad players. "And there is no reason why other players with coaching qualifications cannot work with other Cornish clubs at no salary cost to that club. "We have a deep squad this year and will continue to target all competitions. Once we have decided and agreed which players we think will make the grade we will commence negotiations and we will be cutting our cloth to suit. "Our budget funds next season should be sufficient to enable us retain a very competitive side." </body>

      <title>Rangers forced to postpone their AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers' annual meeting is delayed after shareholders seeking changes to the club's board won a court decision.</description>

      <body>Rangers have been forced to postpone their 24 October annual meeting after shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision. Lord Tyre granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, preventing the AGM from going ahead. Rangers had said there was not enough time for four directors nominated by shareholders to be put up for election. But the group said Rangers had broken the law by failing to ensure the motion was on the agenda. It is the latest development in a battle for control of the Scottish League One leaders. The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed to the board. Paul Murray told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme : "Today was all about shareholder democracy. We wanted to put in front of the shareholders, the fans and the other stakeholders of the club the ability to have a democratic vote at the AGM. "We submitted four nominations on 27 September. Those have been shown today to have been perfectly valid legal notices. "The club's board chose to ignore those notices and issue an AGM notice that is flawed and set a date of 24 October that is now having to be rearranged." "I think both [chief executive] Craig Mather and [finance director] Brian Stockbridge have to seriously consider their positions tonight because I think they are untenable. "The board chose to tie us up in all sorts of legal mechanisms that were reported today in court and we've been vindicated." Richard Keen QC, representing the shareholder group, accused the club of engaging in "guerrilla warfare" in its battle to prevent a group of shareholders from joining the Ibrox board. He told Lord Tyre the directors of the club had "committed an offence" by not informing other shareholders of the requisition. "An offence has been committed by every member of this board," Keen said. "The board have placed themselves in a very difficult situation by failing to discharge their statutory obligations. They have committed an offence. "If I am right, the consequences of that must be visited upon them." Mather and his fellow board members have been sued by the requisitioners. The current Rangers board has so far blocked the attempts at change, claiming the application was not properly authenticated and that it did not arrive on time. Keen claimed the signatures requested by the board had been offered "timeously" before adding: "These requests have been sent by the relevant companies and, on the face of it, there is no reason to doubt their validity." However, Heriot Currie QC, representing the board of Rangers International Football Club, told Lord Tyre: "The petitioners have known since 12 September that they had to organise themselves for a shareholder meeting by no later than 30 October." The Murrays, along with shareholders Ian Cormack, John Graham and Colin Howell, made requests in writing to Rangers International Football Club plc to give notice to members of the resolutions to appoint new directors at the AGM on 27 September. They maintained they had enough support from institutional shareholders to take them over the key threshold of 5% of the total voting rights to allow such a move. Currie said there was no obligation on the part of the company to circulate the resolutions and claimed documents and related information were supplied that at the very least raised "very significant doubt" over three of the backers of the move making valid requisitions. Rangers must re-arrange their AGM to be held before the end of December and must give shareholders at least 21 days' notice. They say they will fix a new date "as soon as possible" with the requisitioners' business included, but they have defended their decision to initially oppose the notices. Following the Court of Session decision, Rangers issued a statement on their website  : "The board of directors of the company received clear and firm advice from its solicitors and senior and junior counsel that on the face of documents provided by the petitioners, the notices had not been signed in a manner that was authorised and as a result the directors were obliged to seek further clarification from those shareholders. "Every effort was made to engage with the petitioners on these issues. However, the petitioners chose to resolve the matter in court. In Lord Tyre's opinion, these irregularities did not invalidate the notices." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>How big retailers learnt the tricks of high fashion</description>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Taiwan's older students</title>
      <description>Can the elderly save Taiwan's universities?</description>

      <body>Every night after dinner, many of Taiwan's older people go out to nearby parks to chat with their neighbours, or stay home to watch TV and play with the grandchildren - but not 62-year-old Yu Chin-shan. He takes his briefcase full of books and notebooks, and goes to college. The semi-retired Mr Yu owns an IT services company and has been a boss for 20 years. But now he wants to fulfil a dream he couldn't afford when he was younger. "I didn't go to college when I was young because my family didn't have the money. So I started working and eventually started a business. But I found there were many things about business management that I still wanted to learn," said Mr Yu. He is among a new wave of older people going to college for either short-term classes or degrees as Taiwan's life expectancy increases and the population ages. In 2008, Taiwan's government began offering subsidised university courses for older people, as a way to help them live more active lives. At first, older people had to be persuaded to attend college. Now they bring their friends and travel from other cities to take classes ranging from healthcare to history and law. This year, 100 universities in Taiwan have offered these courses and the older student population has shot up from about 800 in 2008 to more than 3,000 today. This is happening as many of Taiwan's 160 universities are facing declining enrolment from younger students. At Taipei's China University of Science and Technology, the student population has dropped by several hundred this year. The university had 10,000 students a few years ago, but is now down to about 9,000. Universities, who must compete for the shrinking number of students, fear that some will have to close in the coming years if the trend continues. The university blames the decline on Taiwan's low birth rate. Many young people are delaying getting married, not marrying at all, or are having fewer children or none at all. Meanwhile the island's universal health care system, which provides medical care to 99% of the population at relatively low costs for patients, is also improving health and prolonging the lives of Taiwan's people. The average lifespan in Taiwan has reached 80 years. As early as 2016, Taiwan's 65-and-overs will outnumber those under the age of 14 for the first time. By 2060, four in every 10 people on the island will be 65 or older. Tien Chen-jung, president of the China University of Science and Technology, says some institutions, including his own, are hoping to attract more older students - many of whom never had the chance to go to college, or even secondary school back in the days when Taiwan was still a developing economy. "We feel this is a huge market," Mr Tien said. "Many elderly people don't want to just stay at home all day. They have a thirst to learn. We've found that with the right programmes and good teachers, they are very happy to take classes here, and we believe they will even pay full tuition to get a degree." Enrolment among older people has increased by about 25% a year over the past few years, with nearly 1,000 enrolling last year. After taking the subsidised classes, Mr Yu became even more interested in learning. This year, he enrolled for a degree in enterprise management. "Some people might think it's too late for me to go to college, but I think it's never too late to learn. I believe in the saying, 'Live until we reach old age, learn even after we've reached old age,'" he said. "I think lifelong learning is very important. It keeps our mind active and strong." For his bachelor degree programme, Mr Yu even has to take general education courses, like his younger classmates. That includes sports. In a school gymnasium full of young students playing table tennis one night, he's clearly the only one with gray hair. But although he hasn't played in 40 years, he returns his opponent's serves almost every time. He's not only keeping up in this and other classes, he's doing better than some of his younger classmates. That's perhaps a sign of what's to come, for Taiwan's rapidly ageing society. </body>

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 year's ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>How bad are US debt levels?</title>
      <description>How does the US compare with other major economies?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24541140</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70526000/jpg/_70526925_richardanderson180956181.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Taken out of context, the numbers are staggering. The US has a total debt pile of almost $17 trillion (£10.6 trillion), which is expected to rise to almost $23tn in the next five years. But how does that compare with other major economies? Japan is not far behind, with current debts totalling $11.5tn. By any standards, these are big, big numbers. And these countries are not alone - almost every major global economy has debts of more than a trillion dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But context is needed - after all, debt is not necessarily a problem if you have the income to cover it. That is why the two most common measures used to gauge a nation's indebtedness are: Some governments actually run a surplus - in other words their income exceeds their expenses. Running a surplus is one of the best ways to reduce overall levels of debt. Looking at debt-to-GDP tells us that total US debt is roughly equivalent to its annual economic output. It is by far the largest economy in the world, and has the largest debt pile. Japan is the world's third largest economy, but its huge pile of debt is more than double its GDP. The only other country whose debts outstrip economic output is Italy, although a number of others come close - namely the UK, France and Canada. Even Germany, traditionally seen as fiscally responsible, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 80%. Much of this debt has been accumulated over the long term, but the numbers have rocketed in recent years as governments have struggled to cope with the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessions that have ravaged almost all major economies. Banking bailouts, economic stimulus measures and falling tax revenues have all forced governments to borrow more. For example, in 2007, the UK's debt pile was just 44% of GDP compared with 88% last year. This reflects in part the country's large financial sector relative to its overall economy. The US's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was 64%, the same as France and Germany. By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio in China and India, which have seen economic slowdowns but no recession, has not moved significantly over the past five years, nor is it set to deteriorate in the next five. Indeed in the case of China, it is set to fall significantly. The picture elsewhere is less encouraging. The IMF estimates that Germany aside, those countries with high levels of indebtedness will struggle to reduce debt levels in the coming years. The UK, where the government has made much of reducing debt levels, will actually see the debt ratio edge towards 100% of GDP. One reason for this is governments' inability to move from an annual deficit to a surplus. In other words, an inability to live within their means. The IMF estimates that only Australia and China of the world's 12 largest economies will move into surplus by 2018, while Germany will increase its surplus further. Russia, it thinks, will move from a surplus to a deficit. However, most major economies are expected to make good progress in reducing their deficits. </body>

      <title>Impact of a Royal Mail strike?</title>
      <description>Contingencies and opportunity during a postal strike</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24551650</url>
      <date>1381941928</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70524000/jpg/_70524338_70521370.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A nationwide strike of Royal Mail workers is to go ahead, says the Communication Workers Union, after its members voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action. The last time national strikes by postal workers were seen in the UK was in 2009, when a series of walkouts led to widespread disruption. It was estimated that in the first wave of nationwide strikes in 2009, there was a backlog of 30-60 million pieces of post. In the second wave, the backlog was of more than 50 million. It was also reported that some businesses suffered heavy losses, orders were unfulfilled, staff were unpaid, and some were even laid off. So what will the impact be now, in 2013? The context of the postal service has changed. In the past four years competition has boomed, and while any disruption to the six-day-a-week universal service will be unwelcome to many, this time a lot of businesses have already made other plans. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman John Allan is urging his members to start preparing now to avoid a hit on their revenues. "We would encourage businesses to look at contingency plans," he says. "Ultimately, those firms reliant on using the postal service to deliver goods will be put at a disadvantage, with consequential negative impact on their bottom lines." A glance at the websites of online retail giants such as Asos will reveal statements reassuring customers that in the event of a strike, parcels will be directed to other service providers. Amazon, the Royal Mail's biggest single business customer, said in a statement on Wednesday: "If one of our carriers was unable to provide delivery services at any time, we would employ contingency plans which include routing orders through our other carriers." These other carriers have boomed in the past few years - from UK Mail to TNT, DX Exchange, and the likes of Hermes and Yodel. Some of Royal Mail's competitors were even established, says former postal regulator executive Stephen Gibson, of SLG Economics, because of previous industrial action. "The difference really between the strikes of the recent past and now is that there is more competition now," he says. "Previous strikes became a market opportunity for companies, and after winning that business, they've kept it." David Stubbs, a postal economist, agrees that a lot has changed in the world of deliveries since 2009. He says that competitors have proved themselves reliable, especially for businesses who were reliant on the Royal Mail, such as many eBay companies. However, he says, for smaller companies, strikes could cause real problems, especially given the timing. "If there were to be more strikes, leading up to Christmas, there would be real issues," he says. "Royal Mail processes almost double the volume in December over a normal month. "For the big retailers, they will have already got other plans in place, and they will have contracts with competitor companies. However, it will be disruptive. Those competitors are already straining with deliveries." He adds that some services, such as TNT, may look to expand their network. "There is a potential that alternative postal companies may expand their end-to-end delivery networks - TNT might try and deliver more to the home," he says. "But there is some uncertainty around what Ofcom [which regulates the sector] would do in that situation - the regulator has threatened to impose universal service conditions on competing mail providers." Andrew Starkey, the head of e-logistics at IMRG, the body that represents the UK's online retailers says that more choice in service has also been matched by a surge in the volume of parcels delivered, so taking on more business contracts will be a problem. "Royal Mail has been the default carrier of choice along with the post office network while the online shopping sector has developed, and though more competition has come into the market, there is also a lot more volume," he says. He says that by the end of 2013 there will be an estimated 1.24 billion online orders generated by UK retailers and eBay traders. "There are tens of millions more orders this year than last from online retails and Royal Mail carries about 50% of them," he says. That figure rises to 90% for returns, Mr Starkey adds. "If Royal Mail goes down everything creaks." Yet Mr Starkey says that the alternative network can cope with a one-day strike. "If it's more frequent, or a week-long stoppage, then that's a problem," he says. However, he and postal economist David Stubbs agree that the increasing popularity of "click and collect", whereby online orders are collected by the customer at a local shop, will ease congestion for parcel deliveries. Mr Starkey adds: "This came into its own in the very bad snow of 2010. It caught on from that point, and for small retailers who don't have this in their own stores, their networks have grown. "There are about 12,000 outlets now. That's about the same number as there are Post Offices anyway." </body>

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>The struggle for profit in Australia's surfing industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>

      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Are Indonesia's elderly changing course?</title>
      <description>Changing attitudes towards residential homes in Indonesia</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24530350</url>

      <body>On any given Wednesday at the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan care home for the elderly, on the outskirts of Jakarta, you'll find 78-year-old Sisi Sihombing participating in a gentle exercise routine with her friends, in an attempt to keep her body fit and her mind active. Dozens of elderly residents take part in this keep-fit workout. It's an energetic way to ward off the loneliness that old age can sometimes bring. Most of them live in this charitable institution because they do not have families to look after them. Some pay a subsidised fee to live here, while others are accommodated thanks to the generosity of donations. Mrs Sihombing one of the few residents with close family living nearby - but this sprightly grandmother of seven made the unusual decision to move here voluntarily, after her husband died. "I didn't want to be a burden to my children," she tells me in her small dorm, decorated with photographs of her grandchildren. "They have families of their own and have to live their own lives - that's why I decided it was time to move here." But it was not an easy decision for her family to understand. Her daughter Yoko tells me that she was devastated when her mother decided to move. "It was humiliating, and we didn't speak to Mama for six months," Yoko says, struggling to hold back her tears. "We are from the Batak Indonesian culture, and it is our responsibility to look after our parents in their old age. Our neighbours thought it was our decision that Mama had moved out - that we had kicked her out. "No-one understood that she wanted to do this out of her own free will," she adds. Though Mrs Sihombing is still in the minority - it appears to be becoming an increasingly attractive choice. Tjandra Kamandari, who runs the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan home, says she has seen the number of elderly residents who voluntarily choose to enrol - despite having families willing to look after them - rise considerably during the past few years. "Increasingly these days the elderly are looking for places like this because they are looking for friends, and healthcare facilities that are available to them on site," she tells me. "Also, what is life like at home in Jakarta these days? Your son will work, your daughter-in-law will work, your grandchildren go to school, and the domestic staff at home can't be bothered to look after you. "It's better to be here and have some companionship and make friends." This is why Herman Kwik, the founder of Rukun Senior Living, decided to invest in this sector. The retirement complex covers 35 hectares outside Jakarta and aims to provide a luxury lifestyle complete with beautifully landscaped gardens, a swimming pool, a jogging track and even fishing facilities. It offers a number of services to residents, from regular health checks to gourmet lunches. Mr Kwik says it was visiting the US that led him to believe this concept could work in Indonesia. "We've seen that Indonesia is a few years behind the US in everything - fast-food trends, fashion, cuisine," he says as we walk around the well-kept grounds. "So I thought, 'why not this segment of the market?'. Senior care issues haven't been addressed very well by the government or the private sector." But accommodation at Rukun isn't cheap by Indonesian standards. A month here costs at least $1,000 (£600). And only five of the 60 rooms are occupied full time. Mr Kwik says the market is not yet mature enough to sustain his business. "In these early days of trying to develop this market we have a lot of vacancies, so we are trying to utilise our space," he tells me. "We have also accommodated non-senior types of functions - like banquets, parties and events. That's what we have to do in order to pay the bills while we're trying to develop our senior market. "There is a term for filial piety in Indonesia - durhaka - it's almost like a guilty feeling, or that you've betrayed your parents if you don't care for them until they die," he says. "We've had enquires from many elderly residents, but then they are prohibited from enrolling because of their children." Back at the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan, Yoko has finally accepted her mother's decision. "It was very challenging to get over the fact that Mama decided to break ties with us and move here," Yoko says. "But I can see that she is genuinely happy now. What more can you ask for your parent?" I ask Mrs Sihombing if she ever gets lonely. "Sometimes," she says, smiling. "But I keep busy and my children and grandchildren are only a phone call away. And here I'm in control of my own destiny. There's no feeling quite like it." </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s. The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery". The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab". And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s. The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994. He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years". "For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote. He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment". Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court. The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together. The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths". "The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote. Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey. When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair". Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run". The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'". In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?" The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare". One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over. "At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote. The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement". </body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <title>Ex-BBC man guilty of sex attacks</title>
      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <body>US filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have received France's highest cultural honour at a ceremony in Paris. The brothers, who won three Oscars in 2008 for their crime drama No Country For Old Men, were each made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. Accepting the award, Joel said: "Sometimes life plays jokes on you - some of them are very unfortunate, some of them are very fortunate. "This is one of the most fortunate jokes I think life has played on us." The award is given by the French government to people who "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance". Eight of the Coen's films have premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, with 1991's Barton Fink winning the Palme d'Or. Their latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, also won the Grand Prize of the jury at this year's festival. Released in the UK next January and starring Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, the film tells the story of a struggling singer-songwriter against the backdrop of the 1960s New York folk scene. French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who presented the honour to the pair, said: "We have extremely strong links between French cinema and American cinema so it's natural there's this recognition for two of the greatest directors in the US today." Other recent recipients of the honour from the world of film and music include Ringo Starr, Bono and Bruce Willis. </body>

      <description>The corporation has revealed how it plans to mark the centenary of World War I, beginning in 2014 and culminating in 2018.</description>

      <body>The BBC has revealed how it plans to mark the centenary of World War I. Programming and events will span four years, across television, radio and online, from 2014-2018, echoing the time frame of the war itself. "I want 2014 to be remembered for our national commemoration of all those who served on the battlefield and on the Home Front," said BBC chief Tony Hall. "And a chance for us all to learn something new about a war we think we know well." The season will include 130 newly commissioned programmes, spanning almost 2,500 hours. Among them will be two major TV dramas on BBC One: The Ark will take viewers into the lives of the medics and their patients at a fictional field hospital behind the trenches in France; while The Passing Bells tells the story of the war through the eyes of two very ordinary young men. On BBC Two, Ian McDiarmid stars in 37 Days, which will explore the politics behind the build-up to war. The events will also be retold on BBC Radio 4 in 1914 Day-by-Day, a 42-part series featuring archive news excerpts, from the day of the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand to the outbreak of war five weeks later. Radio 4 will also air two dramas. Homefront is the story of "the 41 million Britons who didn't fight in the great war but whose hearts were pinned on the five million who did", and will run across four years in 15-minute instalments, pitting fictional stories against a background of truth. Tommies, a series of plays narrated across the four years of war, revolves around British Empire soldiers, focusing on a sergeant in the Lahore division of the Indian army and a group of signallers. Kate Adie tells The Story of Women in World War I on BBC Two, and relates the role of women as nurses, ambulance drivers and surgeons during the great war. "We are setting out to broaden people's understanding of the war, to commemorate and remember those who were caught up in it and to tell both well-known stories from fresh perspectives and original stories so far untold," said Adrian Van Klaveren, BBC controller behind the centenary season. Horrible Histories The season will also include programming about poetry, paintings and music, as well as programmes by eminent historians including Sir Max Hastings, Christopher Clark and Niall Ferguson, tackling some of the biggest debates about World War I. Meanwhile, BBC Children's and BBC Learning will seek to explain the war to younger viewers, through programmes including a specially-commissioned Horrible Histories. "A century on, we should perhaps remember and respect that sacrifice," said Jeremy Paxman, who fronts the documentary series, Britain's Great War, looking at the impact of the World War I. "And realise that more than any other event, this was the one that made modern Britain." </body>

      <body>Comedian Russell Brand is to edit a special edition of British political magazine the New Statesman. The 38-year-old will preside over a revolution-themed issue, with contributions from Alec Baldwin, Noel Gallagher and Naomi Klein. In a statement, Brand said his "first act" as editor would be to rename the magazine "the Nude Statesman". The comedian has recently been engaging with politics, appearing on both BBC Question Time and the Andrew Marr show. His Question Time performance received mixed reviews. A polemic about the treatment of drug addiction, of which he has experience, went down well, but his views on Syria and the banking crisis were felt to be too simplistic. The star, who quit the BBC in 2008 over the "Sachsgate" prank phone call row, also caused a storm at the GQ Man Of The Year awards last month, after criticising the event's sponsors, Hugo Boss. Receiving the award for Oracle Of The Year, Brand declared: "If anyone knows a bit about history and fashion, they'll know it was Hugo Boss who made uniforms for the Nazis." He was subsequently ejected from the ceremony, but defended his comments in a column for The Guardian. "The jokes about Hugo Boss were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them," he wrote, before skewering the uneasy relationship between celebrity culture, politicians and corporate sponsors at such events. "Subsequent to my jokes, the evening took a peculiar turn," he noted. "Like the illusion of sophistication had been inadvertently disrupted by the exposure. It had the vibe of a wedding dinner where the best man's speech had revealed the groom's infidelity. With Hitler." Previous guest editors of New Statesman include the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, whose criticism of the coalition government's policies caused a political row. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei took the helm last year, and his issue won an Amnesty International award for human rights journalism. In a statement announcing his issues, Brand said: "I am honoured to be editing an issue of the New Statesman. "My first act is to edit the name of the magazine to the Nude Statesman, which will allay fears that this populist move will descend into puerility. "This issue will either recapture the glory of JB Priestley's piece which created the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, or plunge the title into despair not seen since it alleged that John Major was giving Downing Street's caterer an unconventional bonus. "I am also suggesting a 'Man of the Year' award ceremony and am looking for sponsors with a spotless past. No time-wasters please." His issue will include discussion of climate change and gay rights as well as "transcendental meditation", the magazine said. Deputy editor Helen Lewis said they had chosen Brand because he was "entertaining, inquisitive and provocative" "I mean, looks-wise, he's no Ken Livingstone, but you can't have everything." </body>

      <body>Comedy Central was forced to repeat an old episode of South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being finished. Computers at South Park Studios in Los Angeles were down for three hours on Tuesday, halting work on the episode Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers. Co-creator Trey Parker told fans "it sucks" but admitted it was inevitable. "After all these years of tempting fate by delivering the show last minute, I guess it was bound to happen," he said. It is the first time he and Matt Stone have missed one of their tight deadlines in 16 years, after famously starting each show from scratch just six days before it is due to air. Most animated TV shows are written several months in advance, but South Park's creators hope to keep the show current and fresh by working to a tight deadline. The US office of Comedy Central said in a statement on Wednesday: "From animation to rendering to editing and sound, all of their computers were down for hours and they were unable to finish episode 1704, Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers, in time for air tonight." The planned episode was replaced with a repeat of Scott Tenorman Must Die, an episode featuring British band Radiohead, which fans had voted their second favourite of all time in a poll in 2011. The team posted pictures of the blackout on the show's Twitter feed and revealed that Goth Kids 3 was now scheduled for next week. Earlier this year Parker and Stone's musical The Book of Mormon opened to rave reviews in London's West End, after a sell-out debut on Broadway. They confirmed two years ago that they would continue animating the adventures of South Park's Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman until 2016. The show recently kicked off its 17th series in the US to its highest ratings since 2011, with 4.3 million viewers tuning in across three broadcasts. The taboo-breaking animation is broadcast on Comedy Central in the UK at a week's delay and Goth Kids 3 is now expected to air on 30 October at 22:00 BST. Scott Tenorman Must Die will be broadcast in its original slot on 23 October. </body>

      <title>Man Booker gets youngest winner</title>
      <description>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton becomes the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries, which is also the longest to win in the prize's history.</description>

      <body>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton has, at the age of 28, become the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries. Her 832-page tale of the 19th-century goldfields is also the longest work to win in the prize's 45-year history. "It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling," said Robert Macfarlane, chair of the judges. Catton was announced as the winner on Tuesday night at London's Guildhall. When her name was called out, "it almost seemed like the rest of the room ceased to exist," she told the BBC's World Update. Her book, a Victorian mystery tale set during the New Zealand gold rush, is intricately structured according to astrological charts - with each section exactly half the length of its predecessor. When it was shortlisted last month, the judges described it as a "Kiwi Twin Peaks". "You begin it and you think you are in the clutches of a big baggy monster," said Macfarlane on Tuesday, adding that what followed was an "accelerating, quickening tilt to the narrative". "We have returned to it three times now and we have dug into it - to use its own metaphors - and the yield it has offered at each new reading has been extraordinary," he said. The prize, announced live on the BBC News Channel, was presented this year by the Duchess of Cornwall. On receiving the award, Catton admitted that her lengthy, complex novel had been "a publisher's nightmare", saying she had been compelled to buy a bigger handbag to carry it around. She then thanked her publishers for striking the "elegant balance between making art and making money". The other authors on the shortlist were NoViolet Bulawayo, for We Need New Names; Jim Crace, for Harvest; Jhumpa Lahiri, for The Lowland; Ruth Ozeki, for A Tale for the Time Being; and Colm Toibin, for The Testament of Mary. Crace had been the bookies' favourite to win, with Catton reported to have a late surge of support over the weekend. Macfarlane said the judges' final decision had been made after "just under two hours of pretty tough discussion". Canadian-born Catton was raised in New Zealand and is the second writer from that country to win the prize. The first was Keri Hulme in 1985 with The Bone People - her first and only novel. The Luminaries is the longest ever Booker winner, beating Hilary Mantel's 672-page Wolf Hall which won in 2009. Macfarlane joked: "Those of us who didn't read it on e-readers enjoyed a full upper-body work-out." Set in 1866, The Luminaries begins with Walter Moody arriving to make his fortune on the New Zealand goldfields. He stumbles across a tense gathering of 12 local men, who have met in secret to discuss a series of unsolved crimes. Moody is then drawn into a mystery involving a missing wealthy man, a prostitute who has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune which has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Catton began writing the novel at the age of 25 and completed it when she was 27. She turned 28 last month. The previous youngest winner was Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won for The Famished Road in 1991. Kiran Desai was previously the youngest woman to win, at 35, with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006. "One can approach this as a murder mystery with seances, corpses, lawsuits and puzzles," said Macfarlane. "It does require investment… but it operates like the best kind of goldmine. You pan and then the yields are huge." Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles, said: "For those who are simply looking for a great story, the murder mystery at the heart of the book is thoroughly gripping and that alone should ensure very strong sales. "But there is so much more to it: a vivid cast of characters who leap from the page, a joyful celebration of language and some remarkable experiments with the underlying process of novel writing; critics who have dismissed it as a pastiche of 19th-century fiction have scarcely scratched the surface. "Catton is a writer of rare insight and intelligence, who is at the vanguard of the evolution of the novel. "I'm confident that she is destined to be one of the most important and influential writers of her generation." The six shortlisted writers each win £2,500 and are presented with a hand-bound edition of their book. As winner, Catton receives a further £50,000. This year marks the 45th year of the prize, which was won last year by Hilary Mantel for Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Wolf Hall. Next year the Man Booker Prize will be open to authors writing in English from all corners of the globe. It is currently awarded to English-language authors from the Commonwealth, including the UK, Ireland and Zimbabwe. The decision has split the literary establishment, with critics saying that American novelists will come to dominate the prize. </body>

      <body>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, has admitted struggling to remember how to write a play. He told The Times that he has found it hard to find time to focus on what will be his first stage play in seven years. "I can't just put things aside for a day and come back. My brain just isn't good enough anymore," said Sir Tom, whose career has also seen him write extensively for TV, radio and film. "I know what I want to do in the next six months. I don't know if I can." Sir Tom, whose radio play Darkside - inspired by Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon - was recently broadcast on BBC Radio 2, told the newspaper (subscription) that he was hoping to find a hideaway so that he could concentrate on writing. "When I was younger I could do something useful just by being free for half a day, but now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head," he said. Sir Tom added: "I wish I could remember how to write a play. I can't remember how they happened." However the writer, who spent four years adapting Ford Madox Ford's book Parade's End for a BBC drama which aired last year, admitted taking on multiple projects could be to blame. "There are too many things I find it difficult to say no to," he said. "So I'm clearing the desk and planning to work without interruption." Sir Tom, who won an Oscar for the Shakespeare in Love screenplay he co-wrote with Marc Norman, also adapted Anna Karenina for the big screen last year. Breaking Bad He has written more than 30 plays for the stage, including The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, and this latest untitled project would be his first since Rock'n'Roll in 2006. It is said to tackle "the intersection of science and metaphysics". Earlier this month, Sir Tom collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London. It was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter, to be awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies". But when asked about his long-term plans, Sir Tom joked that it involved "a very protracted deathbed in which I watch Breaking Bad and all the box sets people keep talking about." </body>

      <title>Mysterious elephant wins photo prize</title>
      <description>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit whose picture has earned him one of the world's top photo awards.</description>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries. You can see more images by clicking here. Some viewers may find the last photo in the gallery distressing. The WPY exhibition opens on Friday 18 October at the Natural History Museum. </body>

      <title>Prisoners survives box office slump</title>
      <description>Child abduction thriller Prisoners holds on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.</description>

      <body>Child abduction thriller Prisoners has held on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million. The Hugh Jackman movie remained the UK's number one picture for the third week in succession, despite making only £968,990 between Friday and Sunday. Its takings were almost twice that of WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, which opened in a disappointing sixth place. The film made £502,495 in its first three days in UK and Ireland cinemas. Previews of animated movie Turbo, not included in this week's chart, are understood to have taken more than any title in the official Top 15. The DreamWorks release officially opens in the UK on Thursday and will have its preview takings added to its first weekend tally. The lacklustre landscape allowed Edinburgh-based musical Sunshine on Leith to claim second place in this week's chart after opening last week at three. Dexter Fletcher's film, which features songs by Scottish sibling duo The Proclaimers, took £732,296 in its second weekend on release. Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is ranked at number three with a third weekend tally of £642,241. The film, which boasts an Oscar-tipped performance by Cate Blanchett, has now made £3.33m, making it Allen's most profitable title ever at the UK and Ireland box office. With Filth at four and Rush at five, The Fifth Estate held the dubious honour of being this week's highest new entry. This is despite a major promotional push and the presence of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Its failure to woo UK audiences was further underlined by the performance of marital drama Le Week-End at number seven. On a screen-for-screen basis, Roger Michell's film - which stars Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a long-married couple spending a weekend in Paris - made more than twice as much as its tech-savvy rival. Further down the chart, action sequel Machete Kills languished in 12th place with a three-day tally of £165,586. Its takings were only marginally superior to those recorded by Romeo and Juliet, an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, whose £137,448 tally saw it open outside this week's Top 15. </body>

      <title>Fassbender too 'busy' for Oscar push</title>
      <description>Actor Michael Fassbender says he will not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role in 12 Years A Slave.</description>

      <body>Michael Fassbender has said he will not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role in 12 Years A Slave. "It's just a grind. And I'm not a politician. I'm an actor," the Irish Prometheus star told GQ magazine. Two years ago, Fassbender hit the campaign trail, chasing an award for his performance as a sex addict in Shame, but failed to earn a nomination. "I won't put myself through that kind of situation again," he added. Fassbender is widely considered a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for his role as Edwin Epps, a sadistic Louisiana plantation owner, in the new film which has been directed by Shame's Steve McQueen. "You know, I get it. Everybody's got to do their job. So you try and help and facilitate as best you can." But the X-Men star - who is currently filming the latest sequel in the Marvel franchise, Days of Future Past - says he will be "too busy working" to take part in the endless parade of screenings and interviews that Oscar campaigning requires. "I just don't really have time," he told GQ's Zach Baron. "I'll be in New Zealand. I'll be on the other side of the world," he added, explaining that he will be shooting his production company's first feature - a Western - before moving on to film Macbeth, opposite Marion Cotillard. Last year, the 36-year-old called award ceremonies "a vanity thing", adding, "It does become important to you. And it shouldn't." In 2012, Joaquin Phoenix flatly refused to campaign for an Oscar for his role in The Master, deeming the awards circuit "total, utter bulls**t". The actor went on to win a best actor nomination. The film, 12 Year a Slave reunites Fassbender with McQueen, who gave the actor his first big break when he cast the actor as Bobby Sands in Hunger. It will open across the UK in January and is the harrowing story of a free black man Solomon Northup, played by Britain's Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is kidnapped and sold at auction. Fassbender will next be seen on the big screen in Ridley's Scott's The Counselor. In some US awards related news, it was also announced that the release of Gone Girl has been moved to October next year, putting the film - based on Gillian Flynn's bestselling book - in contention for the 2015 awards season. The thriller, starring Ben Affleck and directed by David Fincher, will open on the same weekend in the US as Fincher's multi award-winning The Social Network opened in 2010. </body>

      <title>Epic row over final cut of Noah film</title>
      <description>Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky is at loggerheads with Paramount over the final cut of his biblical epic Noah.</description>

      <body>Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky is at loggerheads with Paramount over the final cut of his biblical epic Noah. The film, which is reported to have surpassed its $125m (£78m) budget, has received negative reactions following test screenings across the US. According to the Hollywood Reporter, screenings have taken place in New York, Arizona and Orange County to allow for religious diversity. Christian and Jewish audience reactions were said to have been "worrisome". The film is based on the story of Noah, who in the Bible was warned of an impending flood and built an ark to carry two of each species of animal to safety. The film, which is set for release next March, stars Russell Crowe as Noah, alongside Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson and Ray Winstone. It also involves extensive CGI, including all the featured animals. "We had to create an entire animal kingdom," Aronofsky told the Director's Guild of America's Quarterly magazine earlier this month "We chose the species and they were brought to life with different furs and colours. We didn't want anything fully recognisable but not completely absurd either," explained the New York-based filmmaker. 'Wacko' Aronofsky, whose Oscar-winning movies have included Black Swan and The Wrestler, is well known for his left-field work with a body of films that includes Requiem for a Dream, Pi and The Fountain. Last year, screenwriter Brian Godawa obtained a version of the Noah script and posted his summary online, deeming the film "Environmentalist Wacko". He concluded that the film was "an uninteresting and unbiblical waste of a hundred and fifty million dollars that will ruin for decades the possibility of making a really great and entertaining movie of this Bible hero." In July, Aronofsky screened footage for the church-based Echo conference in Texas and subsequent tweets from audience members suggested the preview was well received. Paramount, which is sharing the cost of the film with New Regency, is reportedly eager not to alienate the Christian audience but it currently remains unclear as to whether the studios or director have rights over the final cut. Rob Moore, vice-chairman of Paramount, told the Hollywood Reporter the film was undergoing a "normal preview process" and the result will be "one version of the movie that Darren is overseeing". He said the studio had "a very long post-production period, which allowed for a lot of test screenings." While Aronofsky "definitely wants some level of independence," he added, "he also wants a hit movie." "We're getting to a very good place, and we're getting there with Darren," he added. . </body>

      <body>Grunge band Nirvana are among 16 acts nominated for entry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. It is the first time the US rock group behind the seminal 1991 album Nevermind have been eligible for admission. Rules state that candidates must have released their debut album or single at least 25 years before 2012. Linda Ronstadt, Hall and Oates, Peter Gabriel and British prog-rock band Yes are among the other hopefuls receiving their first nominations. Ronstadt's nomination follows the 67-year-old's revelation in August that she has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. More than 600 music industry personnel will vote to select the inductees, who will be announced in December. An induction ceremony for the chosen honourees will be held in New York in April. Brit rockers Deep Purple, Kiss and The Replacements are among the other bands in contention. Rap artists N.W.A and LL Cool J and folk legend Cat Stevens - who now performs as Yusuf Islam - have also been shortlisted. Disco stars Chic, funk band the Meters and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band have received nominations for the second consecutive year. If selected for induction, Nirvana will enter the Hall of Fame almost exactly 20 years on from frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide in April 1994. According to the Hall of Fame's nomination citation, the Seattle rockers are "proof that the right band with the right noise can change the world". Gabriel, previously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 as a member of Genesis, is in contention again for his work as a solo singer-songwriter. Based in Cleveland, Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has been inducting performers since 1986. This year's inductees included late disco queen Donna Summer, hip-hop group Public Enemy and singer-songwriter Randy Newman. </body>

      <body>Maxine Powell, the etiquette instructor who taught Motown Records' artists how to carry themselves during the label's '60s heyday, has died at the age of 98. Her Artists Development Department - known as Motown's Finishing School - was considered as important to its operations as any singer or producer. Some of its training included teaching Marvin Gaye to sing with his eyes open and the proper way to exit a limousine. Powell died of natural causes on Monday at a hospital in Southfield, Michigan. Her death comes less than two months after a tribute event held in her honour at the Motown Museum in Detroit. The August event saw singer Smokey Robinson describe Powell as an "integral part" of the label's legacy. Born in Texarkana, Texas, Powell was raised in Chicago and began her career as an actress before moving to Detroit. There she opened the Maxine Powell Finishing School, which led to her being brought to Motown to help prepare its artists for their lives in the spotlight. Label chief Berry Gordy remembered some of Powell's advice to her students included "do not protrude the buttocks". "You had style," said the Motown founder in a videotaped tribute played on 26 August. "You gave them class." "I love all the Motown artists,'' Powell said on that occasion, adding she intended to teach "until there's no breath left in my body". According to a Motown Museum spokeswoman, she died at Southfield's Providence Hospital "peacefully surrounded by Motown family and close friends". </body>

      <title>Stars 'made sex objects' - Church</title>

      <body>The music industry has a "culture of demeaning women" that forces stars to sell themselves as sex objects, according to singer Charlotte Church. Church said she was "pressurised" into wearing revealing outfits in videos by male executives when she was 19 or 20. Now 27, the star said young female artists were routinely "coerced into sexually demonstrative behaviour in order to hold on to their careers". She made her comments during BBC 6 Music's annual John Peel Lecture. Her stinging attack on sexism in the music industry comes amid a heated debate over the sexual imagery used by pop stars like Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. The music business is "a male dominated industry with a juvenile perspective on gender and sexuality" and increasingly wants "sex objects that appear child-like", Church claimed. The star accused record labels of encouraging young singers "to present themselves as hypersexualised, unrealistic, cartoonish, as objects, reducing female sexuality to a prize you can win". She continued: "When I was 19 or 20 I found myself in this position, being pressurised into wearing more and more revealing outfits. "The lines that I had spun at me again and again - generally by middle-aged men - were: 'You look great, you've got a great body, why not show it off?' "Or: 'Don't worry, it will look classy, it will look artistic.' I felt deeply uncomfortable about the whole thing, but I was often reminded by record label executives just whose money was being spent." She recalled feeling "massively uncomfortable" about dancing suggestively in little more than a basque and knee-high boots in the video for her single Call My Name in 2005. "Whilst I can't defer all blame away from myself, I was barely out of my teenage years and the consequence of this portrayal of me is that now I'm frequently abused on social media, being called slut, whore and a catalogue of other indignities," she said. "Now I find it difficult to promote my music in the places it would be best suited because of my history." She particularly criticised Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Robin Thicke. Cyrus's routine at the MTV Awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger, sparked a furore over whether she had gone too far. Sinead O'Connor wrote an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business. Church also accused video websites of doing too little to prevent young viewers from being able to see explicit videos, and supported Annie Lennox's recent call to give pop videos film-style age ratings. In her speech, delivered at the Radio Festival at The Lowry in Salford, Church added that radio stations should consider dropping singles by artists whose images were too risque. She said: "As Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, announces the new iPlayer channel for Radio 1, the question must be asked - should programmers take into consideration the image of an artist when deciding whether to play and promote their music? "There are countless examples from the last few years of songs that have been in high rotation, that have little to no artistic worth, but are just plain rude." BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour broadcast a special live edition on Saturday, dedicated to women in music, to mark the lecture. </body>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom will begin a regular audit of the quality of broadcasters' subtitles from next year. It follows complaints by viewers about inaccurate subtitles, or subtitles which are delayed, freeze or disappear. Under the new measures, broadcasters will be asked to monitor the quality of their subtitling on live TV shows every six months, for two years. Subtitles are used by more than a million people in the UK suffering from hearing impairments. In the past, viewers have made clear that, although pre-prepared subtitling is generally of good quality, the quality of live subtitles is often poor. In particular, the speed, accuracy and synchronisation (or latency) of live subtitles. A consultation, which began in May and ended in July, suggested more problems arose when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitling to be prepared in advance. Ofcom intends to publish the first of its reports on subtitling standards in the spring of 2014. In addition, the watchdog is asking broadcasters to report on any technical problems that disrupted subtitling. These reports will allow broadcasters and viewers to monitor progress and see where there is room for improvement. Ofcom will also use this evidence to consider whether changes to its current guidelines are necessary, and whether there is a need to set targets for broadcasters. Following the consultation, some broadcasters have advocated greater use of block subtitling (in which a chunk of text appears on screen rather than a word by word basis) in programmes containing a mix of pre-recorded and live content, such as news bulletins. Viewers have made clear that they prefer block subtitles, provided this does not come at the cost of increased delays, and as such, Ofcom has encouraged their use by broadcasters. It has also called on broadcasters to consider a time delay to live programmes, which are not time-sensitive, in order to improve the quality of subtitles . Ofcom's Claudio Pollack said the watchdog was taking "important steps towards improving the quality of subtitling on live programmes". "Ofcom expects regular reporting by broadcasters to help improve subtitles over time, as well as allowing us to identify exactly which areas need most progress." Seventy TV channels now provide subtitling in the UK. </body>

      <body>Award-winning comedian and actor John Bishop is to host the Royal Variety Performance next month. It will feature stars such as Gary Barlow, the cast of hit West End musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Attraction, the winners of this year's Britain's Got Talent. Brit Award winner Olly Murs will also perform on 25 November, with the show set to be screened by ITV in December. Stand-up star Bishop said he "never imagined" he would host the show. "As a child, the Royal Variety Show was like the Grand National and the FA Cup final - it was something our family always watched - the only difference being that we didn't bet on the winner," he said. "I trust my parents will be proud when they take their seats in the audience, although I have told my dad not to shout, 'Come on son.' It's not a match or a horse race!" Dame Edna Everage will take a break from her farewell tour to appear in the variety show, with more acts set to be announced nearer the time. The evening at the London Palladium hopes to feature the best musical performers, theatre, comedy and speciality acts from the UK and abroad, as well as several surprises. The event is staged in aid of the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund - whose patron is the Queen - which helps people from the world of entertainment who are in need of care and assistance. Each year the winner of ITV's Britain's Got Talent gets the chance to perform on the show as part of their prize. This year's competition was won by Hungarian shadow dancers Attraction at the show's grand final in June. At the time judge Simon Cowell said: "It just shows that this country welcomes people from all over the world and they loved this act." </body>

      <body>The BBC has been criticised for paying some staff "excessive" allowances for relocating to its Salford offices. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the scale of some allowances was "difficult to justify". But the committee said the BBC "did a good job" overall, completing the move on time and within the £224m budget. A BBC statement said it was pleased the committee had "recognised BBC North was delivered on time, under budget and with no break in services". BBC Sport, Children's, radio station 5 live and BBC One Breakfast were among the services that moved from London to MediaCityUK in Salford in an attempt to make the corporation better reflect the UK. More than 850 staff relocated to Salford, with the last movers there by April 2012. The committee's report said relocation costs for 11 staff members exceeded £100,000 per person, with one costing £150,000. The average relocation cost was £28,000. "Some relocation allowances that the BBC paid to staff to move to Salford seem excessive and its recording of exceptions, some of which resulted in higher payments, was inadequate," the report said. The BBC said that the 11 cases reflected the higher stamp duty and other costs involved in relocating staff who owned high-value properties in the South East, according to the PAC report. Around 10% of relocating staff received allowances that were exceptions to the BBC's standard policy, the PAC added, noting the reasons for many of these were not clearly recorded. But the committee concluded "the BBC completed most aspects of the move to Salford successfully". In the long term, it said the success of the move "depends on the BBC achieving the wider benefits it promised". It continued: "These include reducing the gap between northern and southern audiences in the BBC's market share and stimulating economic and other regional benefits, including creating up to 15,000 jobs." The report went on to suggest the BBC "risks becoming overly dependent" on the Peel Group, the property giant which owns the BBC's Salford buildings. It also said signing a 10-year contract to use TV studios was "risky" because the pace of technological change could see the BBC having to pay for studio services it did not need. The committee also said it was "dismayed" by the failure of the Digital Media Initiative, a BBC IT project that was scrapped in May at a cost of £100m. It said it would examine the matter further later this year. In response, the BBC statement added: "We have just celebrated two years of award-winning TV, radio and online content and the whole region is sharing in the momentum of MediaCity with spend by the public service broadcast channels in the region up from 15.9% to 20%." Speaking on the BBC Blog on Wednesday, Peter Salmon, director of BBC North, said there were "lessons to be learned" from what he called "the biggest move in British broadcasting history". He also admitted the corporation "made a couple of slip-ups" in relocating 854 people from the south of England to the north and said it would "never happen again". However, Mr Salmon said that MediaCity remained "a big success story for the north of England". And he insisted that the "flexible nature" of the BBC's deal with the Peel Group meant "we don't pay them a penny that we don't use to put programmes on air". "What underpins the success of the site... are the brilliant skills of the people we recruited," he continued. "That's why the place is thriving - because great people make it work, every hour of every day." </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show.

      <title>Real story behind Scottsboro Boys</title>
      <description>The real story behind the civil rights musical</description>

      <body>The Scottboro Boys, which opens at The Young Vic tomorrow, is a musical based on the true story of a group of black teenagers wrongly accused of rape. Their case became a milestone in the history of US civil rights - but the daughter of one of the real Scottsboro Boys mainly recalls her father's private suffering. Professor Dan Carter first published his book on the Scottsboro Boys trials as long ago as 1969, so he's become adept at summarising how the complex legal and human saga began. "One day in the spring of 1931 a group of hobos, black and white, were travelling on a train in north Alabama. A fight broke out and the train had to be stopped near the town of Scottsboro. Nine young black men - the youngest was 13 - were arrested. "But then the Deputy Sheriff realised two of the white hobos were in fact women. The young women worried they might be accused of prostitution, so they accused the black boys of having raped them. "I think anyone today who studied the evidence would conclude no rapes occurred. In any case, what happened after March 1931 took on an astonishing life of its own. What happened on the train was just a part of the story." For the rest of the 1930s, the Scottsboro Boys (as they soon became known) were front page news in America. At the first of numerous trials, eight of the nine received death sentences and some of them spent long periods on Death Row. That ultimately no one was executed was in part the doing of the Communist Party USA. The communists paid for the services of celebrated attorney Samuel Leibowitz to defend the Boys. The involvement of political radicals infuriated Alabamans - some of whom didn't much enjoy being lectured by a Jewish lawyer from New York. But Dan Carter says the party's money and organising abilities proved crucial. "Without them, some of the Scottsboro Boys would surely have gone to the electric chair." At times it seemed the Scottsboro Boys had become pawns in a protracted face-off between liberal America and the conservative (and still segregated) south. But over the years the authorities in Alabama lost faith in the evidence against the Boys, who were now men. And perhaps Alabama decided the whole thing was more trouble than it was worth, with repeated appeals to the Supreme Court in Washington. The last of the nine men walked free in 1950, almost two decades after the original charges. Clarence Norris had been paroled in 1946. Seeking a fresh start he assumed his brother's identity and moved north to New York City. He married and took jobs as a warehouseman and in sanitation. His daughter Deborah Webster remembers with absolute clarity the day her father told her and her sister about his earlier life. "I was around 14 or 15 and he was in his late 50s. I was shocked at what he told me. Shocked. "As a teenager in New York I had never heard of the Scottsboro Boys so he had to explain the whole story. But the fact my father spent years in jail for something he didn't do hurt me deeply." "I could see the hurt in his eyes too - and I will never forget it. The pain never left him. It wasn't just his freedom that was taken from him. He didn't have his family anymore and he'd had to assume someone else's identity. Who wouldn't be pained at that? But Deborah thinks ultimately the revelation helped her understand her father better. "My father was very distant. There were times he came off a little too hard. I used to always feel he had no heart at all. But, in later years, I could connect and understand where all that was coming from. It was from a real dark place." "He wasn't educated, due to his situation when he was a young man. So I would get home from school and he would ask me to read his mail to him. "I thought he was checking up on my schooling but then I realised he didn't know how to read. With all the things he went through we had modest means and we struggled a lot. We're still struggling. "But my father never spoke of any hate. He never taught us to be prejudiced and I honour him for that. That had to take a special kind of human being to not have that in his heart after all he'd been through." In 1976, Alabama governor George Wallace agreed to a full pardon for Clarence Norris. Speaking for the TV cameras, after years of lying low, Clarence Norris said he held hate for no one. He wished only that 'these other eight Boys' were around. Deborah recalls that the pardon brought her father great happiness. "He even learned how to read. I took great pride in that, to see him overcome a lot of the barriers he had to face. I will always remain proud of my father and I'm very honoured to be his daughter." Three years ago Deborah and her son Harsan were invited to the original New York production of The Scottsboro Boys. The story might not seem a natural fit for a musical - so had she hesitated? "I was in two minds at first, though I was thrilled that all these years later people are still interested in the Scottsboro Boys. But the way the play was brought across it took a lot of the harshness out of the actual story. So I could sit there and enjoy it. Music lightens the heart." Some see the Scottsboro trials as a precursor of the civil rights movement of later years. Dan Carter says one effect was an important Supreme Court judgement which made it illegal to exclude black jurors in a trial. Professor Carter has been at the forefront of those seeking a full pardon for all nine Scottsboro Boys. It's thought the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles may decide before the end of the year. "I'm pretty optimistic," says Professor Carter. "Of course everyone concerned is dead or presumed dead. But even if it's only a symbol of reconciliation and respect it's one many people would welcome profoundly." The Scottsboro Boys opens at the Young Vic 18 October.

      <title>NoNoNo: Whistling their way to chart success</title>
      <description>Pop trio NoNoNo on their songwriting secrets</description>

      <body>Swedish imports NoNoNo are about to launch an assault on the UK charts with their intoxicating pop anthem Pumpin Blood. Despite its whistled refrain, it was born from the band's frustrations with the music industry, they tell the BBC. It's late August and Stina Wappling is chilling out at her country house in the woods, one-and-a-half hours north of Stockholm. She needs the rest, because soon she'll be spun across Europe and the US in a promotional whirlwind for her band's breakout single Pumpin Blood. A cheery pop riot, it's climbing up the global airplay charts after being featured on an advertisement for a certain popular phone brand. "I haven't heard it on the TV because I don't have a telly," admits Wappling, "but I know it's there". She doesn't have any qualms about her music being used in a commercial. "It's one way to get the music across to more people," she argues, at a time when broadcasters have abandoned pop music shows. "So I don't mind it, as long as it's not a commercial for something evil or bad." Such as? "I wouldn't want to be in a diet bar commercial." Wappling has been around the music industry since she was 17, when Warner Brothers signed her to a publishing contract. She spent her summers working with various songwriters while she completed a psychology degree in Brighton - but the dream didn't live up to the reality. "People are really hit-oriented," she says. "They want to replicate something that is a hit right now - like that would be the best thing that could ever happen. "But that made me really sad, and I started thinking I didn't like writing music that much." Disillusioned, she started working as a psychiatric nurse in a day centre for people with mental disorders. "You help them with their medicine and their day-to-day activities," she explains. "They're in apartments surrounding the centre, so they can always come in to you if they have a problem or they want to talk." She also found a way to put her musical talents to use. "I don't know if it's proven, but there are two people I work with who are really amazing with music," she says. "It seems it can relax a haunted brain. "If you have schizophrenia or something like that, and there's lots of impulses firing off in the brain, music can help you focus and get into a space where you're free from voices and illusions for a little bit. "I feel like I've experienced that. It can be really good for someone who has those kinds of disorders." Wappling hasn't entirely given up on psychiatry ("when I'm 40, I'm going to be a therapist," she says) but music eventually came calling again. Her salvation came in the form of Astma and Rocwell (Tobias Jimson and Michel Flygare), two producers who turned out to be kindred spirits. "It kind of happened gradually," she says. "I was working on my solo project and they were working as producers, and we noticed we liked the same kind of songs." Their tastes were so similar, in fact, that it started to cause problems. "We always wanted to keep the songs for our own projects!" the singer laughs. "In the end, it was so much better if we could put all our energy into one project. "Everyone had been thinking about it unconsciously. When Tobias and Michel asked me, it was like 'of course'. It was almost a relief." And so, NoNoNo was born in summer 2012. The name, disappointingly, is not a tribute to 2 Unlimited's No Limits (ageing ravers take note: Stina is too young to remember it). Instead, it's a two finger salute to the uninspired writers they'd been working with. "It's so scary to say no, to close a door," says Wappling. "You worry that you won't know what to do next. But I think it's more probable that you'll find something you really want to do when you give yourself space. "So we think NoNoNo is something that's positive. You have so much more freedom than you think." With its defiant, optimistic lyrics ("And the whole wide world is whistling!") Pumpin Blood was one of the first songs the band completed. "It almost wrote itself," recalls Wappling. "It all started with Michel having the whistling tune on a very basic track. He played it to me and it made me really, really happy, instantly. "I was like, 'I really want to write something on top of this.'" Whistling is a dangerously unstable element for any songwriter to handle: For every Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay, there's a Wind Of Change. Were they worried it might go wrong? "If it had been 'let's make a whistling hit,' then maybe we'd have had to worry," says the singer. "But it came without a plan. We don't really analyse the music we make - because if you calculate it, that's when it can get a little bit cheesy." While Pumpin Blood is poised for a UK release in November, we're playing catch-up with Scandinavia, where it was a major hit earlier this year. The single was preceded by another, equally-infectious record, Like The Wind, which marries the squawking vocals of Kate Bush to the stroppy percussion of fellow Swede Lykke Li. As a result, the band are under pressure to release an album at home, while touring the rest of the world as newcomers. "The plans are different everywhere," says Wappling. "Everything is really ahead in Sweden. It's a little bit difficult to keep it straight in your head!" The album is almost finished, she says. They just need a decent idea for the title. "Oh, I had a really, really awful one just before I went to sleep," she cringes. "Peace, Love and Cinnamon Buns! "Very strange. I don't even know where it came from. So I gave up and fell asleep." Pumpin Blood is released in the UK on 3 November. NoNoNo play the Ja Ja Ja Festival, a celebration of Nordic music, at London's Roundhouse 9 November. </body>

      <body>Kate Winslet has said her new film Labor Day marks a departure from the strong, feisty women she is used to playing. The Titanic and Little Children star appears alongside Josh Brolin in a much more "fragile" role, as a troubled single mother who is forced to take an escaped prisoner into her home. "I haven't really played a character who was so obviously weak in so many ways," Winslet said at the London Film Festival. "That was intriguing to me. But I admired her strength as well and I felt it was very important that she was strong, because I think that we all have the capacity to be both of those things, no matter how broken a person can sometimes be." Winslet, who won an Oscar for her performance as Nazi concentration camp guard Hanna Schmitz in The Reader, said she loved the fact that her character Adele still managed to be "a good mother" to her teenage son. And she admitted to mothering 14-year-old co-star Gattlin Griffith, who played son Henry, off camera too. "It was one of the most wonderful working relationships that I've ever had," said Winslet. "I just knew that I had to really be his friend and I wanted to guide him. I mean he was really my priority on set." Luckily the actress also found time to bond with Brolin, who revealed he "adored" his co-star. "I think we were very lucky," said Winslet. "Because I mean I hate Leo (DiCaprio) for example." "Obviously that was a joke!" she quickly added, referring to the long-running friendship with her Titanic and Revolutionary Road co-star DiCaprio. Brolin, who plays Frank, a man on the run after 19 years behind bars, revealed they have come in for some stick about the relationship that develops between him and Adele. "You know I've heard it a couple of times. 'It's not very likely this would happen'," said Brolin "And then you go in to watch Jurassic Park, and you go, 'But this would?' You know, it is indeed a movie." For director Jason Reitman, who has had hits with Juno, Up in the Air and Young Adult, the film marks a slight departure from his usual style. "Reading a book or a script for the first time that you're considering directing, it's either love at first sight or its not," explained Reitman of the story, based on a novel by Joyce Maynard. "I just clicked with this book. It made me weep. Having spent a career of just trying to make people laugh, it's kind of nice to be after their tears." However one particular scene involving Adele, Henry and Frank making a peach pie could certainly diffuse the tension. It bears striking similarities to the famous pottery scene between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in 1990 film Ghost. "You know it's funny, I keep on hearing this Ghost reference and it's kind of awesome," Reitman told the BBC. "The Ghost scene, and I guess my pie scene, boarder on being ridiculous. They're an inch away from being satirical and yet they're earnest and lovely." And he revealed pies actually played quite a large role on set. "Joyce (Maynard) taught me to how to make a pie, Joyce taught Josh to make a pie. Josh made a pie every single day of this shoot," said Reitman. "You'd show up at his cottage and he'd be there in an apron, this picture of masculinity, talking about 'look at the crust!'. He'd get all excited." Brolin said he honed his catering skills while working in a restaurant for three years when he was younger, but his career never took off as his father James Brolin had hoped he would be a lawyer. "I like cooking very much, I cook for my kids all the time," said Brolin. "I cooked many pies, this is true. When you watch the film, we gain more weight. Every 15 minutes you see everybody a little bit heavier." Labor Day is being screened as part of the London Film Festival, but will be released across the UK in February. </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <title>Complaints over immigration texts</title>
      <description>The Home Office receives more than 140 complaints after sending text messages which wrongly accused recipients of being illegal immigrants.</description>

      <body>Home Office texts wrongly accusing people of being illegal immigrants have prompted more than 140 complaints. Among those contacted was a veteran civil rights campaigner who has lived in Britain since 1966. Officials have sent messages to almost 40,000 people they suspect of not having a right to be in the UK. Meanwhile, a minister has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be rolled out across the UK. Mark Harper, the immigration minister, told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. His department defended texting people urging them to contact border officials to discuss their immigration status. "We believe it is right to enforce the rules," the Home Office said. "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." It said only 14 people had been contacted in error. But two of them - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the messages. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear." Ministers awarded outsourcing company Capita the contract to trace people believed to have outstayed their visas. The message read: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The complaints come after the government was criticised for using vans with a picture of handcuffs telling immigrants to "go home" if they were not entitled to be in the UK. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. But Mr Harper told Question Time he did not "have any problem" with the overall message and if they had proved successful could be used in other parts of the country. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". And his party colleague, Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, who has since lost his job, said the Lib Dems would not "be agreeing any proposals to bring them back". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper said: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." He added: "It's a pilot. We are assessing the results at the moment." Mr Harper also said: "We are going to publish the results when we have done the evaluation. If it's successful, we will roll it out. If it's not, we won't." </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases of human trafficking discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to new government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often trafficked for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims of trafficking were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims are brought to the UK do anything from work as house slaves to work in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work, in particular laying paving, drives or ground work. Other victims are forced to work in nail bars or takeaways. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud. The trafficking gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to their victims. Those targeted by the traffickers are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes members of their own family. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. She also said the government's Modern Slavery Bill would contain new anti-trafficking measures, including: </body>

      <title>Warning over No vote consequences</title>
      <description>Westminster will "turn the screw" on Scottish spending if people vote against independence, the SNP deputy first minister will tell her party conference.</description>

      <body>Westminster will "turn the screw" on Scottish spending if people vote against independence, the SNP deputy first minister will tell her party conference. Nicola Sturgeon will claim some MPs are "itching" to cut Holyrood's devolved budget, which is Treasury funded. Her speech in Perth comes ahead of the independence referendum on 18 September next year. She will say independence can build on the progress achieved under devolution. Ms Sturgeon will also appeal to undecided voters ahead of the referendum. She will also pledge to continue a £20m funding package to help alleviate the impact of UK government housing benefit changes, dubbed the bedroom tax by critics, into the year 2014-15. The UK government is cutting housing benefit to those deemed to have spare bedrooms. The SNP has called for the policy to be scrapped and has promised to reverse it if Scotland votes for independence. Ms Sturgeon will tell the conference: "Be under no illusion - if we don't vote Yes, Westminster will turn the screw. "And the limitations of devolution will be exposed for all to see." The SNP deputy leader will point out that, under devolution, the Scottish Parliament has the power to distribute the money but Westminster decides the budget. "And we know this much - there are Westminster MPs in all the UK parties itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending," Ms Sturgeon will tell delegates. "So I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote - they are clear cut and they are real." Ms Sturgeon will argue: "Scotland's social security system will be dismantled. Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat. Scotland's budget will be cut. "Scotland can't afford a No vote. If we are to protect, and build upon, the progress of devolution, then we must vote Yes." </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in place in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural towns in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those towns. The Scottish towns are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." The UK most now secure approval for the expanded scheme from the EC, which is expected to announce its decision next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander added. The 10 towns selected for the application have higher pump prices than in locations that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>Litigation 'could paralyse' military</title>
      <description>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential think tank warns.</description>

      <body>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential right-leaning think tank has warned. A report for Policy Exchange says legal action may paralyse the armed forces. It highlights a surge in legal claims against the Ministry of Defence - totalling 5,827 in 2012-13. But lawyers for the families of service personnel dismissed the findings as "political" and "biased". The report says litigation has led to the MoD employing around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year. Entitled 'the Fog of Law', it points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces. The report's authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer, teaching international and operational law. The main "weapon" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), they argue. Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts. This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts. In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government using Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision thrown out by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR. This year, the Supreme Court ruled that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. The report's authors claim that in the long run, "legal creep" could pose a "mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed." They say that the extension of law risks "catastrophically weakening the UK". And they claim it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. Military personnel should not be above the law, says Lt Col Tugendhat. But he added: "As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended." Their report recommends that: But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions. "This report seems to me to be part of a concerted political attack on the Human Rights Act," said Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones and Allen. "Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad. "It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat." Martyn Day from the law firm Leigh Day, which has also fought several high profile cases against the MoD, labelled the report "biased". He said his firm would argue that it is "the breaking of laws which poses the greatest threat to those who risk all for their country. "This includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone." He added: "Greater adherence to the laws, both domestic and international, are the only way in which the MoD's litigation will decrease." The arguments in the report echoed those of the Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, who remains concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements, which could make it more difficult for troops to carry out operations in the future. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats are being "Stalinist" in pushing for the Lobbying Bill to be passed by Parliament, a senior Labour peer has claimed. Lord Bassam, shadow chief whip in the House of Lords, said Nick Clegg's party was wary of losing MPs through campaigns by student groups. He added the bill, aimed at cutting groups' campaign spending on elections, would make Lib Dems less "vulnerable". Ministers say the bill will make politics more transparent The Transparency of Lobbying, non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill would set a £390,000 cap on the amount any organisation - excluding political parties - could spend helping candidates across the UK during elections. Charities, trade unions and other organisations argue this could hamper their work. But the government, which has made some amendments to the proposed legislation after complaints from MPs, argues that change is needed to curb the influence on political contests of unaccountable groups. Speaking to The House magazine, Lord Bassam said the Lib Dems feared concerted attacks on their vulnerable parliamentary seats in revenge for the party's U-turn on increasing university tuition fees in 2010. He said: "I'm rather puzzled why the Lib Dems in particular are supporting it [the Lobbying Bill]. Some cynics have suggested that it's because Lib Dem MPs and candidates are vulnerable to particular campaigns, and the one that everybody mentions is the NUS [National Union of Students] tuition fees. "So perhaps the Lib Dem Stalinism on the issue down at the Commons end is partly explained by that. The Tories seem to be rather looser on the subject than the Lib Dems so there's something in that argument." Lord Bassam added: "The Lib Dems are really nervous about losing their MPs, and they seriously think they'll be targeted. "The Lib Dem base is Stalinist-like, whereas the Tories are a bit more flaky because they can see the argument [against the bill]." </body>

      <body>Giving up a seat for someone in greater need is "the right thing to do", Downing Street has said following claims a heavily pregnant MP was forced to stand at Prime Minister's Questions. Equalities minister Jo Swinson was pictured standing next to colleagues during Wednesday's half-hour session. Westminster commentators on Twitter said it was outrageous the Lib Dem MP had not been offered a seat. But Ms Swinson later replied that she had been "happier" standing. The 33-year-old, who represents East Dunbartonshire, is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames. The Spectator magazine's political editor James Forsyth caused a flurry of comments when he tweeted about Ms Swinson on Wednesday. "Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat. Really shocking lack of manners and decency," said Mr Forsyth. According to the Daily Mail, a source close to Ms Swinson said the suggestion that she had been unable to "fend for herself" was "quite sexist". But David Cameron appeared to disagree with this view. Asked if the prime minister would offer a pregnant woman a seat if he were to find himself on a bus, his official spokesman said: "I'm sure he would." "If we take the example of public transport, if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself, then offering that seat is the right thing to do," he said. Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. The MP did manage to find a seat on the government front bench later on Wednesday, when most MPs had left the chamber. Writing on Twitter on Thursday, she joked: "About to get on the Tube - seat offers welcome and definitely not sexist :o) But I was happier standing at pmqs yesterday." </body>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no". The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away. He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny". On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country". Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future. He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no. "And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country. "We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities. "They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract." The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland". He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector. Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself." At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant. He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. </body>

      <title>Army disbandments condemned by MPs</title>
      <description>MPs give their support to a motion urging the government to delay the disbandment of certain Army units.</description>

      <body>MPs have backed a motion urging the government to delay the disbandment of certain Army units. The motion, introduced by backbench Conservative MP John Baron, called on ministers not to dissolve regular regiments until plans for overhauling reserve forces are finalised. Ninety-two MPs voted in favour of Mr Baron's motion. None voted against it. Those who backed Mr Baron included 18 Conservatives and two Liberal Democrats. Backbench business motions are not binding and, since the debate was not whipped, it is not counted as a government defeat. Mr Baron, who served with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in the 1980s, said the government's plans to replace regular personnel with reservists were "on the rocks". "Territorial Army numbers are at a low ebb, reserve recruitment targets are being missed, costs are rising, and there are delays and disorganisation," Mr Baron added. The government wants to expand the Reserve Force, formerly the Territorial Army, to 30,000 by 2018 to help fill gaps left by cuts to the regular Army. The Army will lose 17 major units as it cuts 20,000 regular soldiers by 2020, the coalition announced in 2012. Labour lent its support to John Baron's signal of discontent. Shadow defence minister Kevan Jones warned that "unless ministers change tack now we could have a situation in the not-too-distant future where the capability and defence of this country is at dire risk". Defence minister Mark Francois acknowledged "issues in the process" of boosting recruitment to the reserves and that the system was "too bureaucratic. But he went on to say: "We are working with our recruiting partner Capita and the senior Army leadership to actively address these issues and I believe we can work through them, simplify the system and meet the objective. "Remember, the key target is 30,000 trained reservists by 2018. We are two thirds of the way there." Following the vote, a Ministry of Defence spokesman commented: "The Army is pulling out all the stops to ensure we deliver this new force." Under the government's plans, four infantry battalions are expected to disappear - the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards), the 3rd Battalion the Mercian Regiment and the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh. A fifth infantry battalion, the 5th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders), will become a single company to carry out public duties in Scotland. The Armoured Corps will be reduced by two units with the mergers of the Queen's Royal Lancers and the 9th/12th Royal Lancers and the 1st and 2nd Tank Regiments. </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>Gloria de Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has accused a news agency of trying to obtain topless pictures of her taken when she was 15. In a blog post, the Labour MP said the agency claimed to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper and was offering thousands of pounds to people who might have copies of the pictures. She would find it "humiliating" if they were published, she told the BBC. She had grown up in poverty and had posed topless for the money, she added. "It's part of me, it's part of my life, it's part of my story," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. "I've got an amazing mum and dad, but after the age of about 10, no-one worked in my household due to my father's ill health. "My parents had jobs, they never had careers, and they were very, very ambitious for their daughter to have a better life than them." The Ashfield MP said she had played truant on days when pupils were able to wear their own clothes, because she was ashamed of her wardrobe. "I wanted some money, like my friends," she said of her decision to pose topless. "There are reasons why I thought that they might be a way out for me, but I would respectfully say that I hope they are not published. "I would find it embarrassing, humiliating." The existence of the pictures "says something about poverty, growing up in poverty", she added. "I'm not going to be a victim here," she said, adding that she did not want to see politics full of people "who, at 15, are thinking 'Ooh, I might be a politician one day'". "Goodness, if someone had suggested that to me, at 15, I'd have thought they were absolutely barking." In her blog, she elaborated: "I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens. I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about. "No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level." Ms de Piero concluded: "It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet." </body>

      <title>Housing benefit review begins</title>
      <description>The government has commissioned independent firms to conduct research into the impact of its changes to housing benefit rules.</description>

      <body>A government commissioned review by independent firms has begun into the impact of housing benefit changes. Under reforms that took effect in April, council or housing association tenants of working age will lose some housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need. The independent review of the policy was promised when the bill became law. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was "responsible" to check on how any new policy worked in practice. In an exchange in the House of Commons on Tuesday deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman claimed that "for 96% of [affected] tenants, there is no smaller home to go to". Mr Clegg told her: "Lots of wildly different figures have been cited about the policy's impact. That is why we are commissioning independent research to understand its impact. "I suspect that it varies enormously between one part of the country and another, and one local authority and another." He was asked about the review during his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio, saying: "What I confirmed in the House of Commons is something that is not new, it's something that we announced back in March. With a "big policy like this, it'd be irresponsible for a government to say 'oh well, it's happening' and not work out or try and assess how it's actually being implemented on the ground", he said. "So we've commissioned a number of independent bodies to provide an ongoing review about exactly how it's unfolding on the ground. The picture is really quite unclear at the moment." Nick Clegg's fellow Liberal Democrats signalled their dissatisfaction with the changes - called a bedroom tax by critics and a spare room subsidy by supporters - when they voted for a review of the policy at their party conference in September. A government spokesman said: "The Department of Work and Pensions routinely commissions research on their new policies. "The deputy prime minister was referring to evaluation work already being carried out by an independent consortium into this policy." The research is being carried out by Ipsos-MORI and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, a division of the University of Cambridge. The initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report in late 2015, according to the Department of Work and Pensions. </body>

      <body>Lord West, the Labour peer and former security minister, has revealed that he was court-martialled about 30 years ago for losing confidential material. The former First Sea Lord and head of the navy was commenting on the government's move to simplify how government documents are classified. The designations Unclassified, Protect, Restricted and Confidential are to go, but Secret and Top Secret are to stay. The peer said it was a subject that went "straight to my heart". On the BBC's Daily Politics programme, he explained: "Some thirty years ago I was court-martialled for losing something that was classified, so as you can no doubt imagine, I pay particular attention to classification of these issues." The new regime will have just three classifications: Official, Secret and Top Secret. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude noted that the previous system had been designed "decades ago". The reforms would "speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and save hard-working taxpayers' money," he added. "There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly. This can devalue the basic security principles. "We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as Top Secret or Secret but for other information the new Official category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what government does." Lord West said: "It's time that this was done, and it's right that this was done." He continued: "It's quite clear that we have too much that's over-classified, and when you're working in an area where quite a lot of things are secret people think: 'Hmm, I'd better make that secret just in case.' "We end up with a plethora of these documents, and handling them, either on computers or sending them to someone else, is incredibly complex and expensive. You have to have special rules for doing it, specials ways of doing it. "I did discover... that if I really wanted a minister to look at something I didn't just have it top secret, I would make a code word. "And then they had to be indoctrinated into it, you would make them sign a piece of paper, and then they really wanted to see it. "But if you gave them something that just said confidential, then they weren't so fussed." </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's First Minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned. The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms. But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize. The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable. Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two. Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home. But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties. The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation. "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize. "If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy." It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure". It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved. It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level. The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents. "Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls." This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies. Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction. Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation. "There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to. "We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added. A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms. "However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales." The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was. Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns. </body>

      <title>VIDEO: Food scandal 'could happen again'</title>
      <description>With cuts to food inspection and reports of increasing fraud, can the public be confident the food we eat is what we think it is?</description>

      <body>With cuts to front line inspectors and reports of increasing food fraud, can the public be confident about food standards following the recent horse meat scandal? Food writer Jay Rayner investigates how well food producers and retailers have responded and visits Tesco's laboratories in Wolverhampton to see what the retailer is doing to improve testing. But the industry is vast and the system of keeping it under control is complex. A new report by the National Audit Office has found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food are not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place. Andy Foster from the Trading Standards Institute says the inspection system is "creaking" and in his view "the horse meat scandal could happen again". The Food Standards Agency says the current financial environment is challenging but it has invested considerably more in the last year to boost efforts and resources to detect problems. Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One England on Monday, 14 October at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>

      <title>What became of the 'Geordie mafia'?</title>
      <description>North East MPs used to dominate the front benches in the Blair years, but not any longer. Why and does it matter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24483810</url>

      <body>There was a time when some said the UK government was run by a "Geordie mafia". And Tony Blair's cabinets were certainly dominated by politicians based in the North East constituencies close to his Sedgefield seat. There was Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn, Jack Cunningham, Stephen Byers, Nick Brown, Mo Mowlam, Hilary Armstrong and latterly David Miliband. Now though, not a single government minister represents a North East constituency. The reshuffle of the government hasn't changed that. William Hague comes closest as his Richmond seat constituency is next to Sedgefield over the North Yorkshire border. Scarborough and Whitby MP Robert Goodwill was also promoted to become a transport minister in the shake-up, but otherwise northerners are thin on the ground. Perhaps that's not surprising, given that the North East isn't a power base for either the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats. But then the shadow cabinet is also devoid of any North East MPs. There are plenty - 13 if you include Cumbria's Jamie Reed - lurking in the junior ranks, but none of them have yet broken into the top team. Part of this may be a result of the demise of that New Labour North East generation. The region saw a big turnover of MPs in 2010 as many of the more established names chose to stand down. It may then need more time for the next generation of North East Labour to make it into the shadow cabinet. Newcastle Central's Chi Onwurah has already been tipped by website Labour List as shadow cabinet material. Her neighbour, Catherine McKinnell (Newcastle North) also occupies a key role in the Labour treasury team. Others are clearly on the rise too. Sunderland Central's Julie Elliott was brought into the shadow energy and climate change line-up in the reshuffle, while Houghton and Sunderland South's Bridget Phillipson is taking her first step on the ladder by being appointed as a whip. Then there are those who are now well-established in the shadow teams - Helen Goodman (Bishop Auckland) in culture, Jamie Reed (Copeland) in health, Kevan Jones (Durham North) in defence, Iain Wright (Hartlepool) in business, Roberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham) in communities and local government and Sharon Hodgson (Washington and Sunderland West), formerly in education, now in women and equalities. But the question is does it matter that the North East doesn't have MPs on the front benches? Many of the current generation are making an impact in other ways. Stockton South MP Conservative James Wharton's push for a European referendum has got him plenty of headlines, and if his bill eventually does trigger a vote, he might have played a part in one of the biggest political moments of our times. Hexham's Guy Opperman has also had more freedom to say what he thinks because so far he has not become a minister. He's spoken out against regional pay, in favour of the living wage and campaigned for fuel duty cuts. He's written a radical book on prison reform. All areas he might have had to steer clear of with a government role. On the opposition benches, Labour's Grahame Morris has led recent debate in parliament on the gun laws following the shooting of three of his Easington constituents. Others on both sides have also played a part in the parliamentary committees that are increasingly influential. Redcar Lib Dem Ian Swales has been helping to question BBC managers on executive severance pay on the public accounts committee. Labour's Alex Cunningham (Stockton North), Pat Glass (Durham North West), and Ian Mearns (Gateshead) have had a chance to hold Michael Gove to account on the education committee. And then all of the area's MPs have more time to dedicate to constituency matters than the likes of Blair and Miliband probably did. Conservatives in the North East have also pointed to the fact that the north-south divide remained stubbornly in place despite a 10-year period of government led by a PM from the North East. But others do still believe the region needs a place at the top table. Newcastle East's Nick Brown - the last remaining member of that North East 'mafia' in parliament - has campaigned for the region to have its own minister. He believes it is essential that someone is championing the region's cause at the heart of government. The government believes that's unnecessary, but there's no question it is now keen to promote northern MPs. The problem is, until the Conservatives and Lib Dems win more seats in the north, there are still too few candidates to choose from. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24563535</url>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. Britain needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <description>More 'plebgate' allegations in growing power struggle</description>

      <body>Tonight yet another serious allegation in what is fast becoming a power struggle between the police and Parliament. An allegation that chief constables overruled a proposal to charge their own men with misconduct. An allegation that - once again - centres on the way Andrew Mitchell was forced from his Cabinet job for calling an officer a "f***ng pleb" - something he insists he never actually said. The minister's fate was effectively sealed after that fateful night in Downing Street when a couple of weeks later he met three representatives of the Police Federation. They stand accused of lying about what was said by Mr Mitchell at that meeting by none other than the Prime Minister himself. "Fortunately, this meeting was recorded, so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue," David Cameron told MPs. The officers have been effectively cleared of misconduct by their bosses - the Chief Constables of West Mercia, the West Midlands and Warwickshire - who found there was insufficient evidence against them. But the prime minister is echoing the police watchdog in declaring that to be wrong. Tonight the Independent Police Complaints Commission has gone even further revealing that the police forces involved changed their minds about their own investigation. A letter from the IPCC's deputy Chair states that: "I note that in the first draft ...the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct although their final report submitted in August did not" MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee have asked the three chief constables involved to come down to Westminster to help them with their enquiries into what on earth went on. "The fact that there is now indications of a second report - the first having been changed - is a serious alteration to the story and we need to look carefully at why there was that change," its Labour chair Keith Vaz has said. What might seem a horribly complex story is in fact rather simple. A growing number of politicians suspect the police have been systematically covering up wrong doing by those in their own ranks. </body>

      <title>Elderly care all sorted? Think again...</title>
      <description>Many pensioners face significant fees before they get help</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24534268</url>

      <body>When the government unveiled its plans for a £72,000 cap on elderly care costs from 2016, ministers were quick to claim they had solved the problem. The era of huge bills for care, an issue which resulted in tens of thousands of people selling their own homes each year, was over, they said. But as politicians and campaigners sift through detail it is becoming more and more clear that all is not quite as it seems. One of the measures trumpeted by ministers was the fact that the bill individuals face could be deferred by getting councils to pay for the care and then allowing them to recoup it from an individual's estate after their death. This option is already available in some areas, but under the changes every council would have to offer it, they said. But it has now emerged the option of deferring payments will not be open to wealthier people. Only those needing residential care who have assets of less than £23,250 (excluding the value of their home) will be able to get their local council to pay the costs. For example, it means someone with £50,000 in the bank when they enter a care home will have to pay the bills as they come in until that has been reduced to £23,250. Only then will they be able to defer the costs. Labour peer Lord Lipsey believes this is such a significant loophole that it amounts to a "sabotaging" of the safeguards. The £72,000 cap will not include the amount an individual pays for the "hotel costs" of a care home - that is to say the normal cost of daily living such as food, energy bills and the accommodation. Under the reforms, these so-called "hotel costs" will be set at £12,000 a year. For a typical care home place that accounts for about a third of the fees. Therefore, it would mean that an individual could find themselves paying over £100,000 over three years (£72,000 in care fees and £36,000 in hotel costs) before the cap kicks in. And once it does they will still be liable for the £12,000-a-year hotel costs until their wealth is whittled away. With any system, there is always winners and losers. In this case it is those in the middle. The poorest will continue to get social care free as they do now. But those with assets of over £118,000 (including the value of property) will be liable for care home costs until they reach the £72,000 cap or their assets fall below the £118,000-mark. It means those with assets of between £150,000 and £200,000 face losing between a third and nearly a half of their in care costs. That compares to 0% for people with below £17,000 and a sixth for those with £500,000. Those even wealthier than that lose even less. It will be up to local authorities to calculate how much an individual has to pay. They will do this by working out the average they pay for care home places for those who get state help. This will stop people moving into a luxury care home and racking up £72,000 in costs in super quick time. Fair enough, you might say. But the problem - recognised by the Health Select Committee earlier this year - is that councils, with the benefit of buying places in bulk, can often negotiate lower fees than an individual can. This could lead to disputes over what the true costs are. The original proposals suggested setting the cap at a much lower level. But in the end ministers came up with the figure of £72,000. This was not plucked out of thin air. Once a person enters a care home, not many live beyond two years. In that time just those requiring the most intensive care are ever likely to accrue bills in excess of £72,000. It means only an estimated one in eight people will benefit from the cap, according to estimates by the government. And that is why Age UK, which has been campaigning for years for reform of the social care funding system, sees the cap as only a start. It argues the cap only benefits those with "the greatest needs" who end up in care homes "for a considerable amount of time". </body>

      <body>MPs who have a past career in front of the TV camera did well in last week's reshuffles and follow in the path of other politicians who made their name in the media before they faced the ballot box. The Daily Politics looked back into the former careers of past and present political figures who also moved from the role of interviewer to interviewee in the television studio.

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have? Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers. And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent. But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved? In some ways, the face of politics is changing. Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female. Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero. The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender. That isn't a misprint. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class. What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps". In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence. Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale. And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss. So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents. Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up. Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction. None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections. It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife. It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland. He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence. But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode. So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail. But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience. So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election. But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry. At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past. At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments. And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms. Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders. And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left. He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership. And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future . Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly. Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed. The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader. And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government. The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2. Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal. She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis. But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent. Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price". And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence. Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election. He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was. Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come. But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed. The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise. At least, not this side of an election. So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties. </body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions. Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget. The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer. Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years. In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists. Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation. Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so. The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn). The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects. This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden. The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects. EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit. </body>

      <title>'Boost family learning in schools'</title>
      <description>Millions of children are being held back by their parents' poor educational attainment, suggests a report.</description>

      <body>Millions of children in England and Wales are held back by their parents' poor basic skills, suggests a report. Involving the whole family in learning can boost educational attainment across generations and should be integral to schools says the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE). Governments should give family learning more support, the report says. England is "a nation in crisis" as far as skills are concerned said inquiry chairwoman Baroness Howarth. "Adults whose parents have low levels of education are eight times more likely to have poor proficiency in literacy than adults whose parents had higher levels of education," writes Valerie Howarth in her foreword. "Surely it is a moral outrage that a nation such as ours should be in this position." The report draws on a recent OECD study which found that adults in England score among the lowest results in international literacy and numeracy tests when compared with the same age group in other industrialised countries. The OECD study, published earlier in October, found England was 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. The NIACE team also looked at research from national and local government, Ofsted and from educational, family and children's charities. They found "particularly compelling evidence that family language and maths programmes benefit children's skills as well as those of their parents and carers". They also found evidence of wider benefits from improving adults' confidence and self-esteem to reducing ill health, unemployment and re-offending. NIACE urges head teachers to fund family learning through the Pupil Premium which is paid to schools to support the attainment of pupils on free school meals or in care. It also calls for government departments to work together to support family learning and to ensure that there is enough funding to meet demand. David Hughes, chief executive of NIACE said: "Imagine growing up in a home where there are no books, no stories and where your parents don't have the confidence to help you with your homework. "Unfortunately that is a reality for too many children - but this situation can be overcome. "Across the country there are examples of family learning programmes which have transformed the prospects of adults and children. "But these programmes should not be the exception, they need to be the norm in every school and community." A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said the government already supported adults to improve English and maths skills, whether or not they were in work, fully funding GCSE and other qualifications. "We support a wide range of provision so that adults can participate in learning in the way that suits them, including community learning, traditional college courses and online learning." The government also supports family learning through the £210m community learning budget to fund a range of flexible courses, including English and maths tailored to individuals' needs and learning styles, said the spokeswoman. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College Leaders said he broadly welcomed the report. "Parents play a hugely important role in their children's success at school, and schools already do a great deal to engage parents and help them to support their children. "There are a lot of examples of good practice already in schools around the country to draw on. "It is a two-way street however, and while schools can offer opportunities parents have to be willing to engage in them. "Sadly some parents can't or won't support their children's learning and in those cases it is incredibly challenging for schools to create family learning links." </body>

      <title>More universities look beyond grades</title>
      <description>More UK universities are using extra and personal information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>More UK universities are using personal and extra information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests. A study says 37% of the 67 institutions who replied to a survey said they used such "contextual data" - and most of the remaining ones planned to do so. UK universities are encouraged to use such data to recruit more students from poor homes. University leaders are calling for an informed public debate on the issue. In England, permission to charge tuition fees higher than £6,000 a year is on condition that universities work to attract and recruit more poorer students. Less formal arrangements, also encouraging this move towards "widening participation", are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research carried out by a publicly funded but independent body called Spa (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) looked at what kind of extra information universities were using when making offers to students or deciding whom to admit. It says a survey it carried out of UK universities in November last year found that 37% of those who responded (67 in total) used contextual data and 57% planned to do so. Extra information used (beyond grades and predicted grades) includes personal details put on an application, information about applicants' school or college, the kind of area they live in and whether they have taken part in activities designed to "raise aspirations". Such data is used mostly, Spa found, in considering whether to admit "borderline" pupils at the point when places are confirmed. After that, it is used in Clearing - the process run in August to match students to places - to decide whom to offer places to, to interview and to admit. Finally, the researchers say such information is used to consider "whether or not to make a differential offer" - that is, when deciding to make someone an offer at lower grades than is usual because of the potential they show. Contextual data has been used for "many years", according to Spa, but is now "playing an increasing role in strengthening fair admissions and access at all stages of the admissions process". It says more research is needed - as well as more transparency from institutions about their admissions systems. The study says more universities are moving towards a centralised system for admissions, away from individual departments controlling this. Professor Janet Beer, chair of the Spa steering group and vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: "Spa's report brings together, for the first time, the evidence base for using contextualised admissions in the UK higher education sector. "It shows us that this information has an important role to play in ensuring fair access for applicants as well as helping to sustain academic excellence by admitting those who demonstrate the strongest potential to thrive in higher education." Professor Beer added that there was a "growing appetite" among universities for using contextual data, not least because of the more competitive market. Paul Clark, from Universities UK (which represents university leaders), said universities were "driven by the desire to maintain excellence by recruiting the best students for their courses and identifying candidates with the most potential to succeed". "This report shows that increasing numbers of universities are looking to use contextual data to do this," he said. "University can be a life-changing experience. Contextual data is one way of ensuring that anyone with the ability and desire to go to university has the opportunity to do so. "As the report concludes, it is also important that universities are open about their use of contextual data and information. There is a need to have an informed public debate about the merits of using this additional data in the university admissions process." There has been some criticism of the use of such data and accusations that this amounts to "social engineering". Private school heads say they support the "sensible and sensitive" use of such information - as long as it is used fairly. Chris Ramsay, from the Independent Schools Council and head master of the King's School in Chester, said contextual data was an important part of the admissions process - and his school used it too. "We are not opposed to its use - as long as it is personal to each student, sensitively and sensibly used, and as long as it is not simply blanket bias for or against certain student types - for example, bias for or against students who went to a particular type of school," he said. "Each student deserves to be treated as an individual, not as part of a politically-determined group. "A student who has been, for example, educated at a low-performing school for only part of his or her career, or who is state-educated but from a socially privileged background, should not be advantaged over one who has worked hard or been given a bursary at an independent school." </body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed across much of England as teachers went out on strike over pay, pensions and jobs. Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed. The action was part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions. Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education". NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice". Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth. Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions. Twenty out of 33 London boroughs provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected. Of those, about 445 schools were completely closed and 450 partially closed. And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools were affected by the industrial action. Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers. More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were affected by the action. She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates." Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare. The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'." A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October. Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education." Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike. She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly. "No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers." Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions". "I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said. "And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews. "I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating. "So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids." A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed. However, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed. She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible. "In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today." </body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening. An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards. The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures. The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward. Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly." However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools. "When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said. The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated. The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair. Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective". It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional". Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen. Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures. This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed. Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards. "Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson. "It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report." In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes. Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future. "Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward." Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address". "Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school." One parent told the BBC: "I know they are teaching my children well. I'm seeing their progress and I have no concerns at all about the school." Another, Razwana Akbar, said: "I am very angry. They have broken the trust as professional teachers, they have let us down." Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city." Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy". He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen." He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all". "David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said. But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure".

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford. It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results. Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published. The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970. Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13. It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level. It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential. Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level. Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications. The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills. And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education. What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement. The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there. Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility. Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results. Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi. Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence. But it was an uphill struggle. The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest. It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels. "We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi. "It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential." </body>

      <title>Apprentice schemes 'need reform'</title>
      <description>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being offered practical qualifications that have little worth, a study says.</description>

      <body>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being awarded practical qualifications that have little worth, a report says. Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns. It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects. The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards". The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved. The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level. The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems. Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels. The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330. The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work. And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship. In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor". The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said. "Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said. He said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop. The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels. No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says. Sir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees. "Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice. "England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs." Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do. "The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved. "The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved." A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers. "Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job. "We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month." </body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned. Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found. Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added. Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said. The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly. But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision." The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election. In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty. Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income. The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week. In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty. For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million. The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families. Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found. It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future. Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to: "Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said. Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase. She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter. "We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News. Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy." Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said. "These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal." Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits. He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment. Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life". Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots". "As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first". On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period. </body>

      <body>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay. Institutions across the UK are expected to be affected by the action, taken by three unions - the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the move. The news comes as teachers plan a strike in parts of England on Thursday. Members of the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT are staging a further regional strike in their continuing row over pay, pensions and workload. The unions planning the university strike for 31 October claim a 1% pay rise offered to staff - including lecturers, technicians and administration workers - means there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison declined to release details of what percentage of its membership had voted. It only said of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay. Quite simply, enough is enough. "We urge the employers to reflect on the fact that they are about to face their first ever strike by three unions at the same time and come to the negotiating table to resolve this dispute. "The suppression of academic pay is one of the most sustained pay cuts since World War II and, while strike action is always a last resort, the fact that staff are prepared to take this step demonstrates just how angry they are." A spokesman for UCEA said: "Employers do understand that the general 1% uplift offered to all may be frustrating to these trade unions, with 5% of the workforce saying they will support strike action. "However, we also know that much more than this is going into pay increases for HEI [higher education institution] staff: 3% incremental rises for many plus merit payments beyond this. "Our HEIs tell us that the vast majority of their staff understand the reality of the current environment and would not want to take action that could harm their institutions and their students." </body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests. Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text. The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common. "These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight. "It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said. For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country. Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met. About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger. Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else. More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger. Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting. "I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight. Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else. "I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place." Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way." According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013. Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm. Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply. With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people. Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands. "What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said. Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content. Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school. But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons. "Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said. She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme. "It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added. </body>

      <title>Fear over part-time student numbers</title>
      <description>Rising fees and pressure on household spending are behind a 40% fall in part-time student numbers, say university leaders.</description>

      <body>A "perfect storm" of causes is leading to a rapid and worrying decline in part-time student numbers in England, university leaders have warned. The Universities UK study blames rising fees, pressure on household budgets and reduced support from employers. It examines why part-time students have fallen by 40% in two years, equivalent to a reduction of 105,000. There are concerns that such part-time courses are necessary to provide the skills needed by industry. Sir Eric Thomas, who headed the review, said "something is going wrong". There has been widespread recognition of the economic importance of part-time courses in allowing adults to improve their skills. Most of the 500,000 students taking part-time courses are adults, a majority are women and most will be studying a vocational or work-related course. But the numbers have been been tumbling for two years and the report says that next year's recruitment figures do not suggest that this downward trend will be reversed. Professor Thomas, who is vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: "The reality is that the UK needs more graduates and relies heavily on part-time higher education to meet these fast-changing skills needs in a fast-changing world. "We ignore part-time study's transformative power for individuals and society at our peril. "In England in particular, numbers are declining and do not look like rallying." The report says that the sharp decline in numbers reflects a combination of factors. It calls for part-time courses to be seen as an integral part of higher education and "not as an add-on". "There needs to be an urgent push at all levels - national, regional and local - to help potential students and employers understand the value of and opportunities for part-time higher education," says the report. Rachel Wenstone, National Union of Students vice president, said there needed to be more thought about how part-time degree courses were compatible with people's lives. "This obvious decline cannot be swept under the carpet any longer - there needs to be a collective response from all levels to the challenges that these groups of students are facing," she said. The Confederation of British Industry's chief policy director, Katja Hall, said: "It's shocking that the number of part-time undergraduate students has plummeted over the last two years. "For our economy to stay competitive we'll need more people with higher levels of skills, so it's more important than ever that working people have the opportunity to re-train and up-skill." Alex Bols, executive director of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities, said: "A decline in part-time study could hamper the UK's attempts to extend its skills base and economic growth." </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Oxford raises exam reform concerns</title>
      <description>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor says.</description>

      <body>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor has said. Mike Nicholson said universities and schools were worried about the limited evidence available on reforming exams. He said plans to make AS-levels a stand-alone qualification would hinder attempts to increase the numbers of disadvantaged students doing degrees. Ministers said single exams would end the "test treadmill" in sixth-forms. Speaking at a Westminster Education Forum in central London, Mr Nicholson, who is director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford University, said changing A-levels was "another great example of a government's tendency to meddle in things they should probably just leave alone". He said: "There is widespread concern, not restricted to the secondary-school sector, but also to higher education, about the limited evidence that there is need for any change and widespread concern that the impact of bringing in both GCSE and A-level changes at the same time is going to just wreck the English education system. "Part of the problem is a total misunderstanding and confusion over activities and information that is in the public domain," he said. Under the government's plans, teenagers will no longer take "modular" A-levels with exams throughout but "linear" A-levels with exams at the end of the two-year course. AS-levels will be separated from A-levels to form a qualification in their own right. Mr Nicholson said that there was an assumption that linearity was good, partly because some universities still operated a system of exams at the end of a three-year degree course. But he added that universities had "managed to cope with modularity". He said students also applied for degree courses with different types of qualifications, including the International Baccalaureate, the Cambridge Pre-U and A-levels. Mr Nicholson also raised concerns about the planned changes to the AS-level. "The loss of AS-levels will have tragic consequences for widening participation and access to higher education. "AS-levels are excellent because they give students a very clear indication of what they are capable of achieving. "The real danger is students will plough on believing that they may not be capable of applying to a highly selective course, but equally believing that they are capable of applying to a highly selective and competitive course. "Losing AS-levels will have a really significant result on the likelihood of students from a disadvantaged background progressing to higher education." Mr Nicholson also said there were misconceptions around the A-level subjects that Russell Group universities - which are considered among the best in the UK - required from prospective students. In 2009 - following calls for universities to be clearer about their admissions procedures - the Russell Group published a list of subjects that tended to be required more often than others. Mr Nicholson told Tuesday's forum:"We tried to respond and give advice. That however has been totally misinterpreted. It states very clearly in the document what the intention is. "People choose to ignore that and say what it's basically saying is here are the 12 subjects that will guarantee you a place at a Russell Group university. "That's total nonsense. If you believe that's the case then I'm sorry but you are deluded." He also said that no university required students to have the government's English Baccalaureate at GCSE. This covers English, maths, sciences, a language and history or geography. "If anything, with GCSEs, we much prefer students to have high grades across a range of subjects," Mr Nicholson said. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "We are putting universities, not politicians, in charge of A-levels to ensure they prepare children for work and higher education. "According to [the exams watchdog] Ofqual, the clear majority of universities favour A-level predictions over AS-levels as an indicator of ability. "Returning A-levels to single exams will end the test treadmill in sixth-forms - something which many teachers complain about." </body>

      <title>Gove urged to monitor free schools</title>

      <body>Michael Gove has been urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt wrote to Mr Gove saying he was concerned problems at Al-Madinah School revealed a "systemic complacency". The government said it was looking into the school before issues became public. A junior education minister warned the Derby free school it had 17 issues to address including poor standards. Free schools are state-funded schools set up by faith groups, parents, teachers and other individuals and groups. They are directly accountable to the Education Secretary as they are not within the local authority sphere of influence. Al-Madinah School was closed for seven days earlier this month after a single day of inspections by Ofsted which found incomplete records of child protection checks for staff. And concerns were raised about female teachers at the school being told to wear the hijab even if they were not Muslim. In his letter to the education secretary, Mr Hunt said: "In the coming days, we expect Ofsted to publish the inspection report on one of your flagship free schools, the Al-Madinah Free School in Derby. "You will be very aware of the high level of public interest and concern generated by the recent temporary closure of the school and the imminent findings of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. "As I am sure you will agree, there should be no excuse for underperformance in any school. But it is especially troubling that 400 pupils should be deprived of a week of schooling because a publicly funded free school failed in its duty to meet basic child safety requirements." He added: "Moreover, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for schools has recently acknowledged that the Al-Madinah Free School is 'delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education', and I am extremely concerned that this situation could be indicative of a systemic complacency on standards." Mr Hunt went on to ask whether Mr Gove was satisfied with current arrangements for spotting underperformance in free schools. He also asked the education secretary to explain how parents would be provided with a "firm guarantee that their children's education and safety is not being put at risk due to the inadequate oversight of your free school programme". The letter also highlighted claims there were warnings from Ofsted regarding potential issues with welfare, health and safety of pupils at the Derby school before it opened in September 2012. Mr Gove was asked to explain what steps were taken to ensure that these "warnings were heeded" and that "all issues were resolved before the school opened". The Department for Education did not address many of these questions in its statement, but it did say: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. "We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence." The Al-Madinah school was among the first free schools in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils. But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward. A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating. "While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur." The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. Ofsted is expected to publish its report on the school in the next week or so. </body>

      <description>Ofsted chief warns of weak leadership in children's services and irresponsible parents.</description>

      <body>"Manifestly and palpably weak" leadership and a high turnover of directors are undermining efforts to improve children's services in England, says Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw. There are 20 local authorities rated as inadequate for protecting children. Sir Michael branded Birmingham as an example of bad practice, which he called a "national disgrace". He suggested the local authority might need to be broken up. Sir Michael also called for a wider recognition of the impact of children's home environments, such as irresponsible and alcohol-dependent parents and living on streets lined with betting shops and fast-food shops. Presenting his annual report on social care, Sir Michael delivered a series of hard hitting messages about weaknesses in protecting children. Inspectors only rated four in 10 local authorities as "good" or better for safeguarding. It should be an "urgent priority" of government to examine the role of local authority safeguarding bodies, said Sir Michael. His inspectors had often reported major concerns about these bodies, he said. And he warned about the negative impact of too much "volatility" in the senior leadership in children's services. "One in three local authorities has had a change in their director of children's services last year alone. The combination of unstable communities and political and managerial instability in our social care services is a dangerous mix," said Sir Michael. He warned that poor leadership was often isolated from frontline staff, such as social workers, many of whom felt "profoundly undervalued". Sir Michael said that the average career span in social work was only eight years and the profession faced a "demographic timebomb". He delivered a stinging attack on Birmingham's services for children - accusing them of long-running failures in supporting the safety and well-being of young people in England's biggest authority. The city had a poor record on child mortality and child poverty, he said, and there had been repeated failings in inspections and inadequate serious case reviews. This was "failure of corporate governance on a grand scale", he said. Asked after his speech if he meant that the authority should be broken up, he said that was the implication of his argument. In response a Birmingham City Council spokesman said: "We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe. This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority." "What we don't need, however, is simply a repetition of our failings without any proposed solutions," said the council spokesman. Sir Michael also warned of the destructive force of "social breakdown" on young lives and how they were let down by their families. "They lack more than money, they lack parents who will take responsibility," he said. There were 705,000 children living with alcohol-dependent parents and 130,000 in homes where there was domestic violence. "Compassion should not be about making excuses," said Sir Michael, who warned about the corrosive consequences of the "hollowing out and fragmentation" of families. He quoted Louise Casey, the so-called troubled families tsar, as warning that there was too much "pussyfooting around" in supporting families, with too many meetings and too little action. Debbie Jones, Ofsted's national director of social care, said that the child protection system was under "huge pressure", with rising volumes of work at a time when local authority budgets were under pressure. The 20 councils where the standard of child protection services has been judged "inadequate" by Ofsted are: Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset. </body>

      <title>Universities 'can drive economy'</title>
      <description>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and given funding to drive economic growth, a report urges.</description>

      <body>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and funded to stimulate growth, a report is urging. It says the government should put £1bn into what it calls Arrow Projects, to turn "globally competitive technological ideas into real business". Current funding streams are too complex, argues author Sir Andrew Witty, boss of GlaxoSmithKline. The government and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, described Arrow Projects as a "great idea". Universities Minister David Willetts said the government would consider what recommendations to make following the publication. "We know that universities are engines of innovation and have an important role to play in driving our industrial strategy," said Mr Willetts. The report, entitled Encouraging a British Invention Revolution, says the UK is a world leader in technology and invention, adding that "the research strength of the UK's universities in an enormous national asset". But it warns: "We will have to work hard to maintain our position of strength in the face of increasing competition." In his foreword, Sir Andrew writes that UK universities have "an extraordinary wealth of ideas, technology and human energy - much of which is world-leading and capable of seeding not just new companies but whole industries". But without better-focused funding, organisation and collaboration, he says, there is a risk of delay and of "British inventions building foreign industries". He says a "thicket of complexity" in funding "leads to unnecessary hurdles for those striving to translate ideas to job-creating businesses". Arrow Projects are his plan for an taking ideas from "mind to factory" with a "globally competitive sense of timing and scale". If they were successful they "could herald a British invention revolution to rival the transformation witnessed in the 19th Century," Sir Andrew writes. He envisages the projects as large collaborations in technologically advanced fields. The partners would not necessarily be "geographically co-located", and would include a range of universities - not just leading research institutions - as well as industry, business and local and central government. The report says the government "will need to create a new funding stream to bring the Arrow Projects into being." This could be composed of both public and private money, from both new or existing sources and delivered perhaps in the form of block grants which would allow project managers to use their judgement as to how it is spent, it says. Universities and businesses would form themselves into consortiums to bid for the funding. The funding would be channelled through the lead university in each project. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "The future of the UK economy depends upon making the most of the knowledge, innovation and energy to be found in universities. This work is already happening but the report challenges us, quite rightly, to do more." Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research universities, also welcomed the proposal: "Discoveries at our world-leading, research-intensive universities have generated billions over the years. "But it's vital for the UK's economy that groundbreaking discoveries make it all the way from idea to implementation and from prototype to profit. "Collaboration with business is a core part of the mission of all our academics. But we need to bridge the gap and help everyone work together." Mr Cridland added: "We also need to ensure that more mid-sized and smaller businesses benefit from the huge potential universities bring. "A single point of entry for companies wishing to engage with universities and a sharper focus on supporting innovation in mid-sized businesses are logical first steps." </body>

      <title>League tables measure eight subjects</title>
      <description>Secondary school league tables in England are to be based on progress in eight subjects, rather than focusing on C grades in five GCSEs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24521957</url>

      <body>Secondary school league tables in England are to be re-designed to discourage an over-emphasis on pupils achieving C grades at GCSE, says Schools Minister David Laws. From 2016, schools will be measured on overall results in eight GCSE subjects. There will be four key league table measures, showing pupils' progress as well as final grades. Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart has hailed the change as an "educational breakthrough". Mr Stuart said it would remove the "damaging obsession" with the C grade boundary. Setting out the reforms in the House of Commons, Mr Laws said they would remove "perverse incentives for schools to act in a way which is not in the best interests of pupils". It will mean shifting away from the current league table system, where schools are ranked by the percentage of pupils achieving five GCSEs grades A* to C, including English and maths. There had been concerns that a disproportionate amount of attention is paid to pupils on this C/D borderline, to the detriment of pupils who achieve at a much higher or lower level. "This gives schools a huge incentive to focus excessively on the small number of pupils around the five Cs borderline. This is unfair to pupils with the potential to move from E grades to D grades, or from B grades to A grade," said Mr Laws. He told MPs that it could also conceal "coasting" schools in more affluent areas, rewarding them with high positions in the league tables without stretching their pupils to achieve their full potential. From 2016 there will be four league table measures for schools. It will show pupils' achievements across their best eight subjects - including English and maths, three core English Baccalaureate subjects including history, geography, physics, chemistry and languages and three other subjects which can include art, music, drama and business. This result will be shown as an average grade for the school, such as a B-. As well as showing GCSE results there will be a measure of progress, showing how pupils have advanced since taking tests at the end of primary school. This will be expressed as a score showing how much the results vary above or below expected levels. If schools achieve the expected levels they will score zero - and if they are below expected levels, they will have a minus score. There will be extra weighting for specific subjects, with English and maths worth double points. Other measures are the percentage of pupils achieving C grades or higher in English and maths and the proportion gaining the English Baccalaureate subjects, English, maths, history or geography, the sciences (including computing from next year) and a language. The revised league tables will mean changes to the way underperformance and minimum "floor targets" are measured. The new floor targets will be based on the amount of progress pupils should have made since primary school. Mr Laws defined the new floor standard as "progress half a grade lower than reasonable expectations. So, if pupils at a school are expected to average a B in their eight subjects, the school will be below the floor if they average less than four Bs and four Cs". In terms of how this threshold will be shown in the new-look tables, such a half grade below expectations would be expressed as -0.5. If schools perform above expectations in pupil progress, equivalent to a full grade above, or +1.0, they will not face an Ofsted inspection the following year. At present there are 195 schools below the minimum level of achievement, but Mr Law said that if the new plans were applied to current results the number of schools below the threshold would double. "The fact that the new accountability measures will put many more schools below the new floor targets will be devastating to many," said the National Union of Teacher's leader, Christine Blower. But she welcomed the "move away from a 'spotlight' on pupils on the C/D borderline. It still remains the case however that a league table and target culture will persist". Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman said there was much to welcome in the changes, including the shift away from focusing on the C grade boundary. But Mr Lightman, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this was "seriously undermined by other ad hoc changes to the examination system". Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, backed the principle of "prioritising the progress schools make with their pupils rather than simply rewarding those with the top grades". But she cautioned that the measurements of progress depended on the reliability of Sats results as the starting point - saying that their validity "cannot be counted on". Mr Stuart welcomed the changes to the league table system: "These plans are an educational breakthrough that will blow away the damaging obsession with the C/D grade boundary and help every child achieve the best possible results." Chris Paterson, author of a report on school accountability for the think tank Centre Forum, said: "Getting the measure that drives school league tables right could be the single most important education reform of the coalition government." </body>

      <description>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad says the British Council.</description>

      <body>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad, says the British Council. More than 14,500 UK students took part in the European Union's Erasmus student exchange scheme in 2012-13, the highest since it was launched in 1987. But the UK lags behind France, Germany and Spain, where almost three times as many students are on the scheme. The British Council says foreign study has been shown to boost job prospects. Ruth Sinclair-Jones, of the British Council, described the scheme as "an ideal way to learn another language and culture". "As the number of specialist foreign language courses decline in the UK, Erasmus is becoming even more essential. "The international experience offered through Erasmus has been shown to make a real difference in terms of people's employability." The British Council has managed Erasmus in the UK for the past six years. Since then, the number of UK students on the scheme has more than doubled, according to British Council data. The latest UK participation figures show a rise of 7% on the previous year. In all, more than 2.5 million students across Europe have taken part in the scheme. Despite the recent rise, the UK is still well behind other major European countries - the latest figures show 39,000 Spanish students took part in the scheme in 2011-12, along with 33,300 from Germany and 33,200 from France. Last year the University of Nottingham was the UK institution to send the largest number of students on to Erasmus exchanges, with 522 participants. The scheme is also popular among students at other members of the Russell Group of research based universities. Last year Leeds sent 459 students, Sheffield 447, Manchester 438 and Bristol 422. Although the numbers are rising across the UK, there has been particular success in Scotland, with 1,877 students taking part last year. Some 13% of Erasmus participants last year came from Scottish institutions, which represent just 8.5% of the UK student population. The University of Edinburgh was the most enthusiastic Erasmus participant in Scotland, with 356 students on the scheme. Vincenzo Raima, director of Nottingham's international office, said the university had set a target for 25% of its undergraduates to be taking part in some form of international scheme or experience by 2015-15. "All the evidence out there tells us that students who undertake international activities gain the additional skills employers are looking for," said Mr Raima. </body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby, which is threatened with closure, says it will support female staff who do not wish to wear head coverings.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings. It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped. Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards. The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled. Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair." Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible." However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation. "We have never received any complaints from our staff." One of the other concerns raised in the letter was that women and girls were being treated less favourably than men and boys. Head of Islamic studies, Mohammad Burhaan, said: "We are an Islamic school and if we were to discriminate against women in any way we wouldn't be faithful to our faith. "If you look at the tradition of Islam, it has a very rich history and heritage of female scholarship - both religious and in the field of science, languages and mathematics - we are very proud of that heritage. "If we were going to discriminate we would have applied to be a single-gender school from the outset." He said the chair of governors was female, most staff were female and most pupils were female. "I think actions speak louder than words and we can't give a bolder statement to our dedication to equality of gender than that," he said. During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Burhaan said head scarves were the code of dress adopted by the school. "If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress. "We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business," he said then. The government had told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they did not have to wear a hijab if it was in conflict with their religion or beliefs. In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by: "I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement." He urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys". The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November. </body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists. Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places. He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools. Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove. More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011. Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally. Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP. Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools". Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment". Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved. Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted. "What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said. New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable. Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards. "If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side. "We are in favour of enterprise and innovation." But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places. Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply". Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached. "Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing." Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs. Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing. Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>Slang such as "ain't", "innit" and "coz" has been banned from a school in south London to try to help students find future employment. Harris Academy Upper Norwood said it implemented the initiative to allow its students to "express themselves confidently and appropriately". Pupils heard using "informal language" will be asked to "reflect" on it. Other banned words include "like", "bare" and "extra" and the phrases "you woz" and "we woz". Starting sentences with "basically" and ending them with "yeah" is also considered to be too informal at the Croydon school. In a statement, the school said: "In addition to giving students the teaching they need to thrive academically, we want them to develop the soft skills they will need to compete for jobs and university places. "This particular initiative is just one of the many ways in which we are building the vocabulary of our students and giving them the skills they need to express themselves confidently and appropriately for a variety of audiences." Terry Victor, editor of the New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English said: "It's wrong. "You cannot censor a young person's language, they're not talking about words that are offensive, they're talking about some of the words that politicians use. "[The word] 'ain't' was around in the 19th Century, people like Dickens used it... and how many politicians have you heard say "basically" to begin a sentence? "Yes, it's irritating but it's part of deliberate language." Harris Academy Upper Norwood opened last month, replacing a secondary school that was in special measures. </body>

      <title>Clangers to make TV return</title>
      <description>Beloved children's show the Clangers is to make a return to television, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015.</description>

      <body>Beloved children's show, the Clangers is being resurrected, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015. Debuting in 1969, the show told the tale of a race of knitted aliens eking out a threadbare existence on a cold blue planet, not far from Earth. The pink, mouse-like creatures lived in craters covered by dustbin lids - whose noisy "clang" gave the show its name. Co-creator Peter Firmin said the new series would involve "great storytelling with lots of heart". The puppet-maker, whose other credits include Ivor The Engine and Bagpuss, promised the new series would be markedly different from the crude, jerky animation of the original. "When you watch the original Clangers you have to make allowances for the limitations of the animation techniques when it was made," he said in a statement. "It was magical for its time, but this is a new Clangers for a new age!" Firmin dreamt up the Clangers with puppeteer and writer Oliver Postgate, who also narrated the series. It was first shown on BBC1 in November 1969, just four months after Nasa's moon landing, and one episode even showed the Clangers making inventive use of a flag left behind by some astronauts. The characters even appeared in Doctor Who - watched by the Doctor's arch-nemesis The Master in the 1972 story, The Sea Devils. Although the creatures communicated in a spooky, swooping whistle, Postgate later revealed that their "dialogue" was written out in full, in English, and often included swear words. On receiving the scripts, the BBC objected, telling him, "Darling, you can't say that on children's television," he told Clive Banks' science fiction website. "I said, 'It's not going to be said, it's going to be whistled,' but [the BBC] just said, 'But people will know!'" Eventually, Postgate won - and the Clangers apparently swear like troopers, for those who can translate. Postgate's son Daniel is writing the scripts for the show's 21st Century incarnation, which he described as a "labour of love". "I've always loved Clangers," he said. "I was about five years old when it was made - just the right age. "The new Clangers is not something we've rushed into. It has been carefully considered." CBeebies controller Kay Benbow added: "Nostalgia is a funny thing, and we always think very carefully about remakes or re-imaginings of classic children's programmes. "The Clangers is a programme that has an enduring magic. The new proposition has been built firmly upon the joyful foundations of the original, and will be produced by a team of exceptional talent which includes the extraordinary Peter Firmin." The £5m production is already under way, and is being co-produced by US pre-school TV channel Sprout, which will broadcast the programme in North America. </body>

      <title>Meeting over funding of NI schools</title>
      <description>People give their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast.</description>

      <body>People have been giving their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast. In June, the education minister proposed changes to the Common Funding Scheme, which determines how funds are allocated to Northern Ireland schools. The proposals had been brought forward by an independent panel of experts who examined the current scheme. They found it was outdated, too complicated and was failing pupils. The panel recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby. The meeting on Monday evening was attended by about 40 people. The majority of those were teachers, with a number of parents there as well. Concerns were raised at the meeting about how the funding changes are implemented. A Department of Education spokesperson said: "When the minister set out the way ahead for how local schools are funded, he undertook to gather the views of everyone who might be affected, or with an interest, who wishes to have their say. "Schools already have a mechanism for responding to the consultation, but, in keeping with the minister's views, we wanted to be able to engage with a wider audience. "This public meeting in Belfast follows one held already in Omagh and enables those who wish to put their views across verbally to have their say. "It forms part of the wider consultation process that has included an online response form, children's and young people's versions and focussed engagement with parents, children and young people." The consultation closes on Friday 18 October. </body>

      <title>Fears autistic pupils 'missing out'</title>
      <description>There are fears some children with suspected autism in Wales are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.</description>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing. In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed. Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis. In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis. According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education. But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed. Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties. But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis. His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area. "I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn. She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities. "When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said. "They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space." Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism. "I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said. "In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well." Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom. "It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said. "The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas." A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need. "We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities. "We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD." A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times. "The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said. "The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner." More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday. </body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report. The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England. The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups. The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints. The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation". It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances." The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship. It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions. The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools". The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise". The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns. One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield. He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda". Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such. "A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents." A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school. "State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman. "They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning. "Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils. "Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice." Paul Bate of the Association of Christian Teachers and a former head of a faith school said: "Some schools, including faith schools, have a clear statement in their articles prohibiting staff from proselytising within the school. "Indeed, the faith school where I was head had such a statement within their articles and the RE curriculum was based around the teaching of philosophy, ethics, and giving the students an understanding of all faiths - which included secularism." </body>

      <title>Thousands of teenagers fail three Rs</title>
      <description>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a GCSE C-grade in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a C-grade at GCSE in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest. And most who do not get a good grade in these key subjects by 16 then drop them. The figures are revealed in new government statistics. From now on, all teenagers will have to continue studying maths and English if they do not get at least a C-grade. The statistics, which have been published for the first time and are described as "experimental" by government officials, show that in 2009-10, about one in three young people (220,000) had not gained a grade A* to C in English by the age of 16. Of these, about 34,000 (15%), went on to re-take the GCSE after 16. About half of those then got at least a C. The figures are similar for maths. Schools minister David Laws said: "English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy. "These figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand. "With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects." The figures come days after a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said literacy and numeracy rates of England's 16- to 24-year-olds were among the lowest in the developed world. Among 16-year-olds in England, only six in 10 achieve the government's minimum target of five good GCSEs including English and maths. Under changes introduced last month, teenagers now have to stay in some form of education or training until they are 17, although this may be work-based. This is due to rise to 18 in 2015. Ministers say they are writing to 12 local councils who are not tracking whether 16- to 18-year-olds are in education or training. New figures show that nationally, 88% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in education or training in June, up 1% on 2012. But the government said there were differences between areas and some councils were poor at tracking what many teenagers of this age group were doing. </body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families. Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing". The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life". The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture". The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards. Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read". "This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories. "Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability." The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents. It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions. "In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average. "The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries. "We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most." Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture. She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again. "There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available. "She will be paying for it until November 2022. "There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads. "The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either." Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier". But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families. The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child. The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights. Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that. The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights. "There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper. "Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived. "Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living." </body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest. Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists. The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early. It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages. The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six. They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain. To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life. Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict. This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests. It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest. Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study. He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age. "This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait." Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly. Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words. Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain. The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language. In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders. "This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study. "This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism." Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions. "There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said. "Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function." The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK). </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson. Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life. The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either. "I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?' "If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on. "I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back." Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture. But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime". "I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said. "I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn." In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths. "People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free." After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust. "Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days. "The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out." Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices." He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point. He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path". Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s. Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching. "The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.' "Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work." Frank says things then went further downhill. "I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored." Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years". He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence. "People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there. "Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story. "If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education. "Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable." </body>

      <title>Corruption and bribery in the classroom</title>
      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report. Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free. In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions. The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews. This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education. In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt". The findings show a huge range of malpractice. In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers". "Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school. In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education. In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools. The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents. So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption? Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places. It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years. But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling. The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges. Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating. Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties. In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found. There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery. The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities. In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications. This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant. It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree. The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College. He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system. And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information. The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality. "Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney. "In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems." There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery. In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials. The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools. Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption. There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds. But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school. "Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney. While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments. Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain. Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets. "Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all. "Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest." </body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>
      <date>1381370654</date>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day? Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess? Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy? Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders. On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security. There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen. But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry. The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS. There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy. Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves. Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups. Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area. There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income. Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China. Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers. The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship". The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future. He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do." "There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says. He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics. In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff. "You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available." There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives. He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment. "This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home." The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning. "I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it." It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals. The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away. The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training. The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms. Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus. But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon? On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields. It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats. There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation. Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect". "I don't take too precious a view of that." But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich. When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players. Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change. "We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades. "There is something powerful in having great seats of learning." </body>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to say. In a speech later, Mr Hunt plans to highlight the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he will say. We should improve our treatment of elderly people, he will conclude. According to pre-released extracts of his speech, to be delivered at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference later, he will say: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He is expected to say: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He will also tell delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicate that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector is improving, he will argue. The Conservative MP will say that the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, will start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014, with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt believes we should learn from Asian cultures, where there is "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he will explain. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he will conclude. </body>

      <body>A "sustained legal assault" on British forces could have "catastrophic consequences" for the safety of the nation, an influential right-leaning think tank has warned. A report for Policy Exchange says legal action may paralyse the armed forces. It highlights a surge in legal claims against the Ministry of Defence - totalling 5,827 in 2012-13. But lawyers for the families of service personnel dismissed the findings as "political" and "biased". The report says litigation has led to the MoD employing around 310 lawyers and legal consultants at a cost of £36m a year. Entitled 'the Fog of Law', it points to the application of the Human Rights Act and the growing application of civilian norms to military conduct via the courts as risks to the UK's armed forces. The report's authors are Territorial Army Lieutenant Colonel and strategy consultant Tom Tugendhat, and retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Laura Croft, who served in Iraq and also as a lawyer, teaching international and operational law. The main "weapon" used in the legal challenge is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), they argue. Although the ECHR had applied since September 1953, the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998 gave individuals the ability to appeal directly to domestic courts. This, combined with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, saw a rise in actions brought through the courts. In the past, those serving in the military were protected from prosecution under Combat Immunity, while the Law of Armed Conflict regulated the conduct of war. But recent judicial findings have extended common law claims of negligence and civil claims of duty of care to the combat zone, and the authors claim this is already affecting the combat capability of the services. They cite cases such as that of Ahmed al-Fartoosi, the leader of the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia, who is in the process of suing the British government for compensation. He alleges abuse during his captivity in Basra, and claims that he was denied his rights under the ECHR. Other claims include that of Ali Al Jedda v the UK (2011). The claimant was arrested travelling from London to Iraq in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in Iraq. He sued the government using Article 5 of the Human Rights Act, a decision thrown out by the UK Supreme Court but overturned by the ECHR. This year, the Supreme Court ruled that British troops remain within the UK's jurisdiction and so fall under the Human Rights Act, even when deployed on active service abroad. The report's authors claim that in the long run, "legal creep" could pose a "mortal threat to the culture and ethos of the military which cannot be easily reversed." They say that the extension of law risks "catastrophically weakening the UK". And they claim it may not be long before a foreign power or even insurgent forces begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing UK forces through legal process. Military personnel should not be above the law, says Lt Col Tugendhat. But he added: "As the ultimate guarantors of a nation's liberty they have agreed, voluntarily, to surrender or limit many of their own rights. Without this, the nation would be undefended." Their report recommends that: But lawyers for Sue Smith, whose son was killed in a Snatch Land Rover in Iraq in August 2007, criticised Policy Exchange's conclusions. "This report seems to me to be part of a concerted political attack on the Human Rights Act," said Jocelyn Cockburn of Hodge Jones and Allen. "Wives or mothers such as Sue Smith come to me not because they wanted compensation money, but to campaign against the use of Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq because they wanted to protect other soldiers, and improve the safety of servicemen and women abroad. "It's very important to have independent scrutiny of decisions made by the MoD. War is risky, and therefore you have an obligation to reduce risk and mitigate the threat." Martyn Day from the law firm Leigh Day, which has also fought several high profile cases against the MoD, labelled the report "biased". He said his firm would argue that it is "the breaking of laws which poses the greatest threat to those who risk all for their country. "This includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone." He added: "Greater adherence to the laws, both domestic and international, are the only way in which the MoD's litigation will decrease." The arguments in the report echoed those of the Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond, who remains concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements, which could make it more difficult for troops to carry out operations in the future. </body>

      <title>Complaints over immigration texts</title>
      <description>The Home Office receives more than 140 complaints after sending text messages which wrongly accused recipients of being illegal immigrants.</description>

      <body>Home Office texts wrongly accusing people of being illegal immigrants have prompted more than 140 complaints. Among those contacted was a veteran civil rights campaigner who has lived in Britain since 1966. Officials have sent messages to almost 40,000 people they suspect of not having a right to be in the UK. Meanwhile, a minister has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be rolled out across the UK. Mark Harper, the immigration minister, told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. His department defended texting people urging them to contact border officials to discuss their immigration status. "We believe it is right to enforce the rules," the Home Office said. "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." It said only 14 people had been contacted in error. But two of them - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the messages. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear." Ministers awarded outsourcing company Capita the contract to trace people believed to have outstayed their visas. The message read: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The complaints come after the government was criticised for using vans with a picture of handcuffs telling immigrants to "go home" if they were not entitled to be in the UK. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. But Mr Harper told Question Time he did not "have any problem" with the overall message and if they had proved successful could be used in other parts of the country. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". And his party colleague, Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, who has since lost his job, said the Lib Dems would not "be agreeing any proposals to bring them back". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper said: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." He added: "It's a pilot. We are assessing the results at the moment." Mr Harper also said: "We are going to publish the results when we have done the evaluation. If it's successful, we will roll it out. If it's not, we won't." </body>

      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases of human trafficking discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to new government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often trafficked for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims of trafficking were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims are brought to the UK do anything from work as house slaves to work in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work, in particular laying paving, drives or ground work. Other victims are forced to work in nail bars or takeaways. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud. The trafficking gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to their victims. Those targeted by the traffickers are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes members of their own family. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill.

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in place in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural towns in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those towns. The Scottish towns are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." The UK most now secure approval for the expanded scheme from the EC, which is expected to announce its decision next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander added. The 10 towns selected for the application have higher pump prices than in locations that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <title>Warning over No vote consequences</title>

      <body>Westminster will "turn the screw" on Scottish spending if people vote against independence, the SNP deputy first minister will tell her party conference. Nicola Sturgeon will claim some MPs are "itching" to cut Holyrood's devolved budget, which is Treasury funded. Her speech in Perth comes ahead of the independence referendum on 18 September next year. She will say independence can build on the progress achieved under devolution. Ms Sturgeon will also appeal to undecided voters ahead of the referendum. She will also pledge to continue a £20m funding package to help alleviate the impact of UK government housing benefit changes, dubbed the bedroom tax by critics, into the year 2014-15. The UK government is cutting housing benefit to those deemed to have spare bedrooms. The SNP has called for the policy to be scrapped and has promised to reverse it if Scotland votes for independence. Ms Sturgeon will tell the conference: "Be under no illusion - if we don't vote Yes, Westminster will turn the screw. "And the limitations of devolution will be exposed for all to see." The SNP deputy leader will point out that, under devolution, the Scottish Parliament has the power to distribute the money but Westminster decides the budget. "And we know this much - there are Westminster MPs in all the UK parties itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending," Ms Sturgeon will tell delegates. "So I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote - they are clear cut and they are real." Ms Sturgeon will argue: "Scotland's social security system will be dismantled. Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat. Scotland's budget will be cut. "Scotland can't afford a No vote. If we are to protect, and build upon, the progress of devolution, then we must vote Yes." </body>

      <title>Most people 'have spiritual beliefs'</title>
      <description>Most people in the UK believe in the power of spiritual forces on earth, despite a decline in church attendance, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite the falling popularity of organised religion, most people in the UK still believe in the power of spiritual forces, research suggests. A study for the Christian think tank Theos recorded 77% as believing some things could not be explained by science or any other means. Among the other findings, 8% said they or someone they knew had experienced a miracle, while one-in-four expressed a belief in angels. ComRes surveyed just over 2,000 people. "The study appears to confirm that, despite a steady decline in congregations and in formal religious belief, a sense of the spiritual remains strong in Britain," said the BBC's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott. Only a quarter of those questioned thought spiritual forces had no influence on earth. And almost two-thirds of those who identified themselves as Christians thought such spiritual forces could influence people's thoughts or the natural world. More than a third of the non-religious shared that belief. Between 2001 and 2011, the proportion of people in England and Wales identifying themselves as Christian fell from 72% to 59%. In the last census a quarter of the population said they had no religion - up from 15% 10 years earlier. "Some secularists have concluded from these trends that over recent decades Britain has become more secular, or more sceptical, or more rational," says Theos in its "belief in post-religious Britain" report. "But the picture is actually very different - more complex and more interesting - than that." </body>

      <body>A police officer shot dead when he tackled a gunman in the street near his home has posthumously been given a national bravery award. PC Ian Dibell, 41, was voted as the most courageous officer at the annual Police Bravery Awards, where 13 other officers were also honoured. They included a PC who dived into a quarry to save a boy from drowning. Mr Dibell died while trying to stop Peter Reeve, who had fired at a couple in Clacton, Essex, in July last year. He was selected as the overall winner after officers were nominated for awards by 37 forces across England and Wales. Other winners were: Peter Reeve, 64, had fired shots at his neighbour Trevor Marshall and Mr Marshall's girlfriend, Katarzyna Karolak, and then chased Mr Marshall in his blue Toyota. PC Dibell, a father-of-two, leaned into the car window to try and grab the gun, and a bullet passed through his hand and into his chest, causing fatal injuries. The constable had ran back to his house to get his warrant card when he realised a gunman was on the loose, meaning that technically he was on duty when he died. Mr Reeve took his own life in a churchyard in Writtle, Essex, the next day. Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "Officers put others' lives before their own. "Sadly, as our winner's story highlights, this can have tragic consequences. "PC Ian Dibell was a valiant team player; his bravery on that fateful day typifies his whole life - always putting others before himself." Home Secretary Theresa May said: "Ian Dibell's death is a reminder not just of the bravery police officers show on a daily basis, but also the depth of their commitment to public service. "PC Dibell was off duty when he stepped in to help a neighbour in distress. He could have walked away, but he chose to put himself in harm's way. "His bravery, and that shown by thousands of his colleagues up and down the country, is yet another reminder that we have the best police officers in the world." </body>

      <title>Transsexual PC sues Essex police</title>
      <description>A transsexual police officer is suing her force after she allegedly had to "out" herself over a police radio system, the BBC learns.</description>

      <body>A transsexual police officer is suing her force after she allegedly had to "out" herself over a police radio system, the BBC has learned. PC Emma Chapman claims Essex Police failed to help its officers understand transgender issues and properly investigate what had happened. The case, believed to be the first of its kind, was heard at an employment tribunal which is now considering its findings. Essex Police disputes the allegations. PC Chapman, 44, was born male and underwent gender reassignment in 1999 while serving as a volunteer officer with Essex Police. Four years later she became a full-time constable and now works on the force's response team. It is thought she is the only transgender officer in the force. PC Chapman said that after initially telling people about the sex change and raising awareness of transgender issues at conferences, she became "frustrated" at the lack of support and understanding about the problems transsexuals faced. She decided not to be "open" any longer and "stepped away" from dealing with transgender issues in 2009. According to legal documents, seen by the BBC, her claim centres on three incidents when she had to speak to the police force's control room via her radio handset. PC Chapman says that on the first occasion, in October 2012, the operator did not believe who she was, saying she had a "male voice". In her witness statement, the police constable said: "I felt a combination of alarm and distress. " I replied... 'I am a transsexual'. "I felt very embarrassed and desperate. The incident took my breath away." PC Chapman said she was left feeling "very distressed" that she'd had to "out" herself over a radio channel that was listened to by hundreds of officers and staff. She reported what had happened but claims Essex police failed to carry out a full investigation and interview the control room operator. Legal papers say two further incidents occurred in June 2013 when the officer was again challenged by control room staff who questioned her identity. "I felt a growing sense of apprehension whenever I had to use the radio, concerned that there may be further, similar incidents," she said. "The radio is also a lifeline at times and I should not have to feel hesitant or anxious about using it." PC Chapman, who's a Police Federation constables representative in Essex, secured the backing of the federation to bring legal proceedings against the force. The officer said the incidents created an "intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment" for her to work in. She is seeking compensation for injury to her feelings and a declaration of discrimination and wants the force to improve the way it deals with transgender issues. Essex Police said it "disagreed" with PC Chapman's assertions and was contesting the case. A spokesman acknowledged that conversations between PC Chapman and the control room had taken place but said the force disputed the "precise wording and tone" said to have been used. The case was heard at the East London Tribunal Court last week after PC Chapman turned down an out-of-court settlement. A decision is expected in the next few months. It is thought that, if she is is successful, PC Chapman could receive compensation of up to £3,000, though her main objective is said to be to highlight the way transgender people are treated. Roy Scanes, Essex Police Federation's branch board secretary, confirmed that PC Chapman had the federation's backing for what was an "important" and "unusual" case but declined to comment until there had been a ruling. </body>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The lettings group said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. </body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation. He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose". Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future". The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues." Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns. The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said. He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs." "Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future." NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future. Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments. She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away." Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made. "We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said. She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable. The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age. A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out. He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement." </body>

      <body>A stone was discovered lodged in County Armagh student Natasha McShane's throat following a random street assault in Chicago, a court has heard. Ms McShane's injuries were so serious that a brain surgeon was immediately told of her admission to hospital. Heriberto Viramontes is accused of the attempted murder of Ms McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in April 2010. Ms McShane has been left with extensive brain injuries after being hit with a baseball bat. She has also struggled with her speech and mobility. The Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago heard evidence on Thursday from the trauma surgeon on duty in the emergency room of Illinois Masonic Hospital when Ms McShane and Ms Jurich were first admitted. Trauma surgeon Dr Marius Katilius said Ms McShane suffered a traumatic brain injury, with blood discovered both inside and outside the skull. Three separate lacerations were discovered. There was blood in her hair, and on her scalp and face. There was "a lot of blood", Dr Katelius said. But he also revealed that following a scan "an opaque structure in the back of the throat" was identified. The medical team "pulled out a stone from the back of the throat". The friends were attacked under a viaduct as they walked home together after a night out in Chicago three and a half years ago. Ms McShane, from Silverbridge in County Armagh, was a 23-year-old student attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault. She had been on an exchange programme, studying urban planning. Her family watched intently as items of her clothing found at the crime scene were pulled from a brown paper evidence bag at the trial. Images of the scene, with Ms McShane's cream-coloured jacket entwined in an olive green sweater beside pools of blood, were also shown in court. A police evidence technician was giving testimony on what she found at the scene. Later, images of Mr Viramontes at a petrol station were shown. Prosecutors allege he tried to use Stacy Jurich's credit card at the station less than half an hour after the two young women were attacked. The trial earlier heard evidence from Ms Jurich, who also suffered serious injuries in the attack. In testimony, Ms Jurich described the moment she was hit. "I heard my head being hit and I felt an excruciating pain and sort of lost my equilibrium," she told the court. "Stupid bitch," her attacker whispered as he snatched her purse and ran off. Ms Jurich said she never saw a face as all her attention was directed towards her friend. "She was not moving on the ground. The blood started coming out of her head," she said. Mr Viramontes, 34, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and 23 other charges linked to his alleged involvement in the attack on 23 April 2010. Apart from Ms Jurich, the trial has also heard testimony from Sheila McShane, Natasha McShane's mother. She described how her daughter remains severely disabled, unable to walk without support, incapable of conversation and barely able to communicate. The jury saw video footage of Ms McShane as she was helped to walk and of her struggling to pick up and drink from a cup of tea. The state's key witness, Marcy Cruz, has pleaded guilty to attempted murder for her role in the attack. The trial of Mr Viramontes is expected to last up to two weeks. </body>

      <title>More universities look beyond grades</title>
      <description>More UK universities are using extra and personal information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>More UK universities are using personal and extra information - not just grades - to decide which students get places, a report suggests. A study says 37% of the 67 institutions who replied to a survey said they used such "contextual data" - and most of the remaining ones planned to do so. UK universities are encouraged to use such data to recruit more students from poor homes. University leaders are calling for an informed public debate on the issue. In England, permission to charge tuition fees higher than £6,000 a year is on condition that universities work to attract and recruit more poorer students. Less formal arrangements, also encouraging this move towards "widening participation", are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research carried out by a publicly funded but independent body called Spa (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) looked at what kind of extra information universities were using when making offers to students or deciding whom to admit. It says a survey it carried out of UK universities in November last year found that 37% of those who responded (67 in total) used contextual data and 57% planned to do so. Extra information used (beyond grades and predicted grades) includes personal details put on an application, information about applicants' school or college, the kind of area they live in and whether they have taken part in activities designed to "raise aspirations". Such data is used mostly, Spa found, in considering whether to admit "borderline" pupils at the point when places are confirmed. After that, it is used in Clearing - the process run in August to match students to places - to decide whom to offer places to, to interview and to admit. Finally, the researchers say such information is used to consider "whether or not to make a differential offer" - that is, when deciding to make someone an offer at lower grades than is usual because of the potential they show. Contextual data has been used for "many years", according to Spa, but is now "playing an increasing role in strengthening fair admissions and access at all stages of the admissions process". It says more research is needed - as well as more transparency from institutions about their admissions systems. The study says more universities are moving towards a centralised system for admissions, away from individual departments controlling this. Professor Janet Beer, chair of the Spa steering group and vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, said: "Spa's report brings together, for the first time, the evidence base for using contextualised admissions in the UK higher education sector. "It shows us that this information has an important role to play in ensuring fair access for applicants as well as helping to sustain academic excellence by admitting those who demonstrate the strongest potential to thrive in higher education." Professor Beer added that there was a "growing appetite" among universities for using contextual data, not least because of the more competitive market. Paul Clark, from Universities UK (which represents university leaders), said universities were "driven by the desire to maintain excellence by recruiting the best students for their courses and identifying candidates with the most potential to succeed". "This report shows that increasing numbers of universities are looking to use contextual data to do this," he said. "University can be a life-changing experience. Contextual data is one way of ensuring that anyone with the ability and desire to go to university has the opportunity to do so. "As the report concludes, it is also important that universities are open about their use of contextual data and information. There is a need to have an informed public debate about the merits of using this additional data in the university admissions process." There has been some criticism of the use of such data and accusations that this amounts to "social engineering". Private school heads say they support the "sensible and sensitive" use of such information - as long as it is used fairly. Chris Ramsay, from the Independent Schools Council and head master of the King's School in Chester, said contextual data was an important part of the admissions process - and his school used it too. "We are not opposed to its use - as long as it is personal to each student, sensitively and sensibly used, and as long as it is not simply blanket bias for or against certain student types - for example, bias for or against students who went to a particular type of school," he said. "Each student deserves to be treated as an individual, not as part of a politically-determined group. "A student who has been, for example, educated at a low-performing school for only part of his or her career, or who is state-educated but from a socially privileged background, should not be advantaged over one who has worked hard or been given a bursary at an independent school." </body>

      <body>Housework and DIY are not strenuous enough to count towards people's activity targets, a paper has found. It had been thought they could count towards the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense activity per week. But the BMC Public Health study, which surveyed over 4,500 adults, found those who counted housework were heavier than those who did other activities. Experts said activities only counted when they made breathing more rapid and the heart beat faster. NHS recommendations do say housework does not count towards the 150-minute goal. But the researchers in this paper say there has been a move towards promoting a "lifestyle approach" to physical activity - encouraging "domestic" activities in people who may not take part in sports or go to the gym. And they warn that, while any activity is better than none, people should be aware that they still need to meet the moderate activity target on top. Participants completed a detailed interview about their activity levels, whether they played any sports or did formal exercise as well as their diet and smoking and drinking habits. They were particularly asked about activity linked to looking after their homes. Domestic housework in 10 minute bursts or more accounted for 36% of the reported moderate to vigorous physical activity people said they did. But when weight and height were taken into account, researchers found that those who counted housework as exercise were heavier than people doing other exercise for the same amount of time. Among women, just a fifth reached the weekly exercise target if housework was discounted. The research team, which included experts from the Universities of Ulster, Sheffield Hallam and Wolverhampton as well as Sport Northern Ireland concluded: "Domestic physical activity accounts for a significant proportion of self-reported daily moderate to vigorous physical activity particularly among females and older adults. "However such activity is negatively associated with leanness, suggesting that such activity may not be sufficient to provide all of the benefits normally associated with meeting the physical activity guidelines." Prof Marie Murphy, from the University of Ulster, who led the study, said: "Housework is physical activity and any physical activity should theoretically increase the amount of calories expended. "But we found that housework was inversely related to leanness, which suggests that either people are overestimating the amount of moderate intensity physical activity they do through housework, or are eating too much to compensate for the amount of activity undertaken." She added: "When talking to people about the amount of physical activity they need to stay healthy, it needs to be made clear that housework may not be intense enough to contribute to the weekly target and that other more intense activities also need to be included each week." Chris Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Your exercise should make you breathe harder, feel warmer, and make your heart beat faster than usual. "So, unless your household chores tick all these boxes, they won't count. "If you're daunted by the prospect of a 150-minute target, think of it in 10-minute chunks. "It doesn't necessarily mean forking out for a gym membership either - try a brisk walk on your lunch break or make a resolution to take the stairs rather than the lift each morning." </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>A £107m project linking Port Talbot and the docks to the M4 will be officially opened later. It is hoped the three-mile (4.8km) Harbour Way running from junction 38 at Margam will boost the docks area with land being opened up for development. It would also help to cut congestion through the town. The road is one of the largest local council transport projects the Welsh government and European Regional Development Fund has backed. "The completion of Harbour Way is a significant development both for the town of Port Talbot and for the county borough as a whole," Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas said. "By linking key employment sites and opening up land for development along the waterfront, the project will present numerous opportunities for growth and regeneration. "The economic benefits will be far-reaching and indeed this investment is already beginning to pay dividends." The docks area is being transformed into a new knowledge-focused business hub, creating hundreds of skilled jobs. Plans are also in place for further development of the wider Harbourside Park area as the 150-acre site has the capacity to accommodate an additional 75,000 sq ft of space It could lead to a potential investment of over £12m and creation of a further 700 new jobs. Proposals are also in the pipeline for a future residential and leisure development which will sit next to the dockside and river corridor. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will open the road, said: "With Harbour Way now complete, and a further £9.5m of Welsh Government funding for the re-development of Port Talbot Parkway train station, robust infrastructure links will soon be in place to attract further investment to the region to transform the area into a vibrant, well connected place to live, work and do business for many years to come." </body>

      <title>Salmond urges Grangemouth resolution</title>
      <description>The first minister calls on both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant to return to normal production.</description>

      <body>Management and unions have been urged by Scotland's First Minister to get Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical plant fired up again. Alex Salmond wants a written pledge that Unite will not strike this year, and at the same time, for owners Ineos to restart operations and return the site to normal production. The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike. Mr Salmond met representatives of Ineos and Unite on Thursday evening. He said there was a long way to go but he believed both sides wanted "a great future for Grangemouth". He called for Unite to swiftly confirm in writing its willingness to provide a guaranteed period of normal working to 31 December and urged Ineos to fulfil its parallel commitment to fire up the plant and return to normal production. Mr Salmond said this would provide the right atmosphere for the necessary consultations and negotiations to build a secure future for the plant. "From my discussions tonight with both parties in this dispute I believe both are sincerely committed to create a great future for Grangemouth," he said. "I believe that whilst there will be a long way to go, I believe that acceptance of my proposal tonight would be an essential first step in this process." At the SNP's conference in Perth earlier he told delegates: "Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found." Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far. However, it reported that its power station at the site - which supplies steam to a neighbouring North Sea pipeline system - was continuing to operate despite the shutdown. The company said fuel was still being sent by tanker from Grangemouth to filling stations in Scotland and the north of England and that stocks of refined fuel at the site remained high, with more being brought in. Ineos has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the complex, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors. A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday. BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016. The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme. The company added that no job cuts were expected. It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday. The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs. It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers. Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday. Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs. "We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away. "It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce." Unite is holding a protest vigil outside the plant during daylight hours. On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday. The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike. A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials. "Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again. "When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities." </body>

      <title>Poverty gap 'causing unjust deaths'</title>
      <description>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say.</description>

      <body>The gap between rich and poor is leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths in Scotland, health experts say. NHS Health Scotland examined 30 years of health trends and found large differences in preventable causes of death across social groups. Director of Public Health Science Andrew Fraser said these patterns of death were not inevitable. NHS Health Scotland called for action to tackle inequality and not just the recognised causes of disease. The organisation's report noted that decreasing periods of health inequality had previously been observed in the UK, suggesting the situation could change. It said there was an urgent need for action to address inequalities in "income, resources and power" across society. The report showed that the gap in deaths across different social groups for specific causes decreased, while others emerged. It revealed that there was little difference in death rates from non-preventable diseases such as brain and ovarian cancer, but large differences in more preventable causes like alcohol-related deaths and heart disease. The common factor suggested for the persistence of health inequalities was social inequalities. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: "Health inequalities represent thousands of unnecessary and unjust deaths per year across almost all social groups in Scotland. "The reason that health inequalities did not fall as particular causes were successfully tackled may be because individuals with more resources were able to protect themselves against new threats to health." Mr Fraser added: "We need a debate and action that helps us to agree answers to the question 'What would it take to eradicate health inequalities?'. "The answers lie in tackling the causes of inequalities, and not just the recognised causes of disease. "Patterns of death that are evident in this report are the end-points of circumstances that span Scottish life rather than focus on a particular disease group. Prevention is achievable, and inequalities are not inevitable. "We can anticipate that the burden of healthcare facing the NHS, communities and families will become progressively greater if we, as a country, don't provide the answers." </body>

      <description>Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk broadcaster Michael Souter is found guilty of historical sex attacks on boys.</description>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16. Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child. Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October. Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke. The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial. He faced two more counts of possessing indecent images of a child, but was cleared of one and the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on the other. He was remanded in custody. The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims. He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999. The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach their verdicts. After the trial, detectives revealed they were investigating further allegations of abuse against Souter. Norfolk Police confirmed a "live inquiry" was continuing into outstanding claims. A total of 595 people have been identified as witnesses and it is understood a number have raised concerns about his behaviour. Det Insp Paul Brown, of Norfolk police's child abuse investigation unit, said Souter had shown no remorse. "In the trial the evidence was overwhelming and he denied what had appeared to be really obvious," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind his interaction with different agencies and organisations was based around the persona that he had around the county. "He used that to ingratiate himself into situations to allow him to offend." Sheila Lock, interim director of children's services for Norfolk County Council, said that when Souter first volunteered as a mentor for vulnerable youngsters, he underwent a "robust" assessment before he was allowed any contact with children. "No concerns were raised through police checks, interviews or references," she said. When abuse allegations came to light in 1993, the council took them "extremely seriously", she added. "We worked alongside police to investigate the concerns and took appropriate protective action to safeguard the children Souter had had contact with. "Souter was clearly a manipulative and predatory man and it is right that he will now serve many years in prison, having added to his victims' suffering by forcing them to give evidence. "Souter's victims have shown incredible courage in coming forward after so many years and today's verdict proves it is never too late to speak out." Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services. "All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed." A BBC spokesman said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms. "Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s." A spokesman for the Scout Association said Souter had not been a member for 25 years. "The Scout Association condemns the actions of Souter and is pleased that the judicial process is now complete and he will now be punished for his crimes," he said. The association had co-operated fully throughout this case, he added. "We can confirm that he will never be allowed to work within the Scout Movement again," he said. </body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24563131</url>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence. Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland. "He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said. Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response. It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed. A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately. "If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded. "Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up." Hodgson was reported  to have referenced the joke when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more. The joke, the exact wording of which is still unclear, revolves around an astronaut and a monkey on a Nasa mission. The monkey performs all the tasks requested by mission control, with the punchline being that the astronaut's only role is to feed the monkey. The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!" Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team. "He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks. "He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken. "We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil." England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day. "All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter." Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport. "Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said. However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong. "This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar. "I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail." </body>

      <body>Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" after recent back surgery. The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after a disc operation last month. Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January. "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," he said. "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year." Murray, who received an OBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of the injury. He recovered in time to become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936. His defence of the US Open ended in the quarter-finals, but he helped Great Britain beat Croatia in the Davis Cup before surgery. He tweeted a picture of himself in hospital with his thumbs up after the operation. </body>

      <title>England will not be World Cup seed</title>
      <description>England rise to 10th in the Fifa rankings, but will not be one of eight seeded teams at next year's World Cup in Brazil.</description>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday. Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament. England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches. But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December. The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded. But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body. Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament. Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions. England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay. Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy. The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football. Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations. France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system. "From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder. He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points. As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier. Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot. Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign. Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel. </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken.</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the country's most common mental health problems.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that. Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations. "He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!" The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out. "Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him." Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia. But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures. "There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal." The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process. "We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods." Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital." The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients. There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so. Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse. "Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times." Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies. Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies". But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life. "I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone." The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients. He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option. "Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense." Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll. "Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself. "I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats are being "Stalinist" in pushing for the Lobbying Bill to be passed by Parliament, a senior Labour peer has claimed. Lord Bassam, shadow chief whip in the House of Lords, said Nick Clegg's party was wary of losing MPs through campaigns by student groups. He added the bill, aimed at cutting groups' campaign spending on elections, would make Lib Dems less "vulnerable". Ministers say the bill will make politics more transparent The Transparency of Lobbying, non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill would set a £390,000 cap on the amount any organisation - excluding political parties - could spend helping candidates across the UK during elections. Charities, trade unions and other organisations argue this could hamper their work. But the government, which has made some amendments to the proposed legislation after complaints from MPs, argues that change is needed to curb the influence on political contests of unaccountable groups. Speaking to The House magazine, Lord Bassam said the Lib Dems feared concerted attacks on their vulnerable parliamentary seats in revenge for the party's U-turn on increasing university tuition fees in 2010. He said: "I'm rather puzzled why the Lib Dems in particular are supporting it [the Lobbying Bill]. Some cynics have suggested that it's because Lib Dem MPs and candidates are vulnerable to particular campaigns, and the one that everybody mentions is the NUS [National Union of Students] tuition fees. "So perhaps the Lib Dem Stalinism on the issue down at the Commons end is partly explained by that. The Tories seem to be rather looser on the subject than the Lib Dems so there's something in that argument." Lord Bassam added: "The Lib Dems are really nervous about losing their MPs, and they seriously think they'll be targeted. "The Lib Dem base is Stalinist-like, whereas the Tories are a bit more flaky because they can see the argument [against the bill]." </body>

      <title>Pregnant minister 'forced to stand'</title>
      <description>Giving up a seat for someone in greater need is "the right thing to do", Downing Street says following claims a heavily pregnant MP was forced to stand at PMQs.</description>

      <body>Giving up a seat for someone in greater need is "the right thing to do", Downing Street has said following claims a heavily pregnant MP was forced to stand at Prime Minister's Questions. Equalities minister Jo Swinson was pictured standing next to colleagues during Wednesday's half-hour session. Westminster commentators on Twitter said it was outrageous the Lib Dem MP had not been offered a seat. But Ms Swinson later replied that she had been "happier" standing. The 33-year-old, who represents East Dunbartonshire, is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames. The Spectator magazine's political editor James Forsyth caused a flurry of comments when he tweeted about Ms Swinson on Wednesday. "Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat. Really shocking lack of manners and decency," said Mr Forsyth. According to the Daily Mail, a source close to Ms Swinson said the suggestion that she had been unable to "fend for herself" was "quite sexist". But David Cameron appeared to disagree with this view. Asked if the prime minister would offer a pregnant woman a seat if he were to find himself on a bus, his official spokesman said: "I'm sure he would." "If we take the example of public transport, if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself, then offering that seat is the right thing to do," he said. Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. The MP did manage to find a seat on the government front bench later on Wednesday, when most MPs had left the chamber. Writing on Twitter on Thursday, she joked: "About to get on the Tube - seat offers welcome and definitely not sexist :o) But I was happier standing at pmqs yesterday." </body>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16 after a six-week trial at Norwich Crown Court. During his trial it was questioned whether the authorities could have done more to stop the abuse. In 1991 Norfolk County Council allowed Souter to adopt. Norfolk Social Services spokeswoman Sheila Lock said all the appropriate checks had been done on the "devious" abuser. Three years later he was arrested and the adoption terminated though no criminal action was taken. Chris McCann, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said because there was no file relating to that period, he was not in a position to say whether or not CPS or the police could have "done something different" in 1993.

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Syrian refugees prefer UK to France</title>
      <description>The fate of the Syrian refugees, stuck in Calais</description>

      <body>Hundreds of Syrians say they are stuck in the French port of Calais waiting to claim asylum in the UK. Some have staged sit-ins, gone on hunger strike or even threatened to kill themselves if they are not allowed to cross the Channel. An estimated 2.1 million people have so far fled the fighting in Syria. The UN says more than 100,000 people have died so far in the civil war which has been raging for more than two and a half years. Ahmed and Ali told BBC Radio 5 live why they wanted to come to Britain: "Britain would provide us with shelter. France gives us nothing." The deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire programme, says Britain is a target for Syrian refugees because it is regarded as a "paradise" for people trying to start new lives. He says mafia gangs are operating in his town and charge more than £10,000 (11,800 euros) per person to smuggle someone into Europe. Mr Mignonet called for more support from the EU in dealing with the problem. Richard Ashworth, the leader of Conservative MEPs, told 5 live: "If the mayor of Calais has evidence of such criminal gangs operating in his jurisdiction he should ensure they are investigated, rooted out and prosecuted will the full force of the law. "Criminality is criminality wherever it happens." He added: "What he should not seek to do is pass his problem on to the UK by seeking financial help just because some immigrants in Calais happen to say their intention was to head for Britain." France is one of 12 countries in Europe that have agreed to offer a limited number of Syrians the right to resettle. The group in Calais have been told by French officials they would be able to claim asylum in France, with a 95% chance of success. Most, though, still seem determined to cross the Channel and are angry at how they have been treated in France. Last week, two men threatened to jump from the roof of the Port of Calais departure lounge unless a representative from the British government went to speak to them and granted them refuge in the UK. They were eventually talked down. They remain in the town and line up daily for food near the port exit. The European Commission says it expects the number of refugees to increase. About 50,000 have so far asked for protection from European countries, the majority in Germany and Sweden. Michele Cercone, the commission's home affairs spokesman, has called for other countries to help. He said: "With a crisis of this magnitude, and the possibility of a prolonged refugee situation, we need to face the situation in the spirit of solidarity. When the pressure is too high on the reception systems of some of our member states, those countries less exposed should be able to step in and support." A Home Office spokesman told 5 live there were no plans to resettle or provide temporary protection to Syrians entering the UK, and added: "Legal and illegal migration in France is the responsibility of the French authorities." The British government has promised to pay £500m to the international relief effort for the victims of the civil war, with that money targeted at providing help to Syria's neighbours. BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire programme will be broadcasting live from Calais at 10:00 BST. </body>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>'Silver Swans' taking up ballet</title>
      <description>The pensioners who are taking up ballet</description>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. And they're very supportive of one another. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <body>It looks like a scene from a low budget science fiction series. In fact, the wooden egg floating on the water in a quiet inlet of Hampshire's Beaulieu River, is home, workspace and laboratory for artist Stephen Turner.

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>
      <date>1382063225</date>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>Friday's papers take aim at British Gas over the energy company's 9% hike in prices. The Daily Mirror sets the tone with a picture of boss Chris Weston alongside the headline: "I'm putting your gas bill up by 10% - now where's my two million pound bonus?" Sun readers should leave what the paper calls "Brutish Gas" and switch to other firms. It's launched a campaign against what it calls "hated" green taxes which it blames for adding to energy bills. "Heat or eat", the Daily Express warns as it predicts soaring bills will lead to a "devastating increase" in winder deaths. The Daily Mail reports on a warning from the Royal Academy of Engineering that the lights could go out as early as next year. And the Guardian highlights a public relations disaster for British Gas after it tried to quell criticism on social media. It says almost 16,000 mostly vitriolic tweets "rained down" on the company in just a few hours. The Times assesses George Osborne's announcement that the Chinese can take a stake in the UK's nuclear power plans. It could pose important security issues, the paper says. In his first interview since being sacked last week, Lib Dem former minister Jeremy Browne tells the Times he is puzzled as to why he lost his job. But it is the plight of a Lib Dem still with a ministerial job who was forced to stand at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday which reaches a number of Friday's papers. The Daily Mail says the Commons is obviously no "hotbed of chivalry" as none of the dozens of MPs sitting nearby saw fit to offer pregnant Jo Swinson a seat. A Daily Mirror editorial argues giving up a seat for a pregnant lady isn't sexism but simple good manners. Millions of people could be spared the agony of crippling back pain by seeking early treatment, according to the front page of the Daily Express. Several papers report criticism of a school in Leeds which apparently allowed pupils as young as eleven to smoke in the playground. The Daily Telegraph says that cigarettes have been confiscated as the children arrive each day, but handed back at break times. There's support for the England manager, Roy Hodgson, after his "feed the monkey" comment during a team talk. The Telegraph calls him "one of the most civilised people in football", while the Independent asks: "Why all the fuss?" Meanwhile children's groups and internet safety experts have rounded on Facebook, according to the Times, after it announced plans which will allow millions of teenage users to open up their profiles to strangers. And finally, a number of papers report findings from scientists who say that from the age of 18 months, children can tell when we are faking our emotions. "Smile and the world smiles with you, cry and you cry alone," says the Times. "However, smile when you feel like crying, and your toddler is going to be pretty puzzled." </body>

      <body>A driver who killed two motorists during an "outrageous" high-speed road race and then fled to the pub has been jailed for five years. Luke Jones, 24, was doing up to 100mph on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road near Brynmawr moments before the crash. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jones, of Clydach, near Abergavenny, braked sharply while racing Phillip Bath, 29. Mr Bath lost control of his car which hit oncoming traffic and he and a motorcyclist died in the "carnage" . Father-of-one Jones fled the scene and went drinking with a friend and was later arrested at a nearby pub. Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones said Jones and Mr Bath came across each other when joining the road. He added: "Their vehicles are described as racing, overtaking one another, speeding and causing other cars to dodge and swerve out of the way. "One witness described Mr Bath's car as skidding around like Formula 1 car warming up its tyres. "Another said it was an accident waiting to happen and that they were driving like lunatics. "They were driving at excessive speed - up to 90 or 100 miles an hour - for a three-mile stretch before the accident. "The collision happened when Jones misjudged the speed of a car in front and was forced to brake. "Mr Bath couldn't stop, he slammed the brakes and spun into oncoming traffic colliding with a motorcycle." Mr Bath, of Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, was taken to University of Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, by air ambulance but never recovered from his injuries. His yellow Peugeot had failed an MOT shortly before the crash and was described as being "not road worthy". Motorcyclist Glyndwr Evans, 49, of Glynneath, who used to work for the RAF, died instantly in the crash on 27 October, 2012. Another motorcyclist was treated at hospital for two and a half months following the crash and will never be well enough to ride a bike again. Jones originally told police the collision had "nothing to do with him" but later admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. He said he was racing but claimed he was only doing 70 mph. Caroline Rees, defending, said: "He had difficulty doing the right thing and pleading guilty. Jones had previously been disqualified twice from driving for not having insurance. Judge Daniel Williams told him: "This was an outrageous piece of driving over quite a distance. "You were racing each other and your driving was described as frightening. "You were using the road like a race track at a time when there were a lot of cars on the road and you represented a serious danger. "At the time you were the lead car and because of your speed you failed to brake in time and Mr Bath went out of control. "I accept you are sorry but that would be of far greater weight if you had not left the scene of carnage which you caused." </body>

      <body>A £107m project linking Port Talbot and the docks to the M4 will be officially opened later. It is hoped the three-mile (4.8km) Harbour Way running from junction 38 at Margam will boost the docks area with land being opened up for development. It would also help to cut congestion through the town. The road is one of the largest local council transport projects the Welsh government and European Regional Development Fund has backed. "The completion of Harbour Way is a significant development both for the town of Port Talbot and for the county borough as a whole," Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas said. "By linking key employment sites and opening up land for development along the waterfront, the project will present numerous opportunities for growth and regeneration. "The economic benefits will be far-reaching and indeed this investment is already beginning to pay dividends." The docks area is being transformed into a new knowledge-focused business hub, creating hundreds of skilled jobs. Plans are also in place for further development of the wider Harbourside Park area as the 150-acre site has the capacity to accommodate an additional 75,000 sq ft of space It could lead to a potential investment of over £12m and creation of a further 700 new jobs. Proposals are also in the pipeline for a future residential and leisure development which will sit next to the dockside and river corridor. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who will open the road, said: "With Harbour Way now complete, and a further £9.5m of Welsh Government funding for the re-development of Port Talbot Parkway train station, robust infrastructure links will soon be in place to attract further investment to the region to transform the area into a vibrant, well connected place to live, work and do business for many years to come." </body>

      <title>Primary school abuse lessons pilot</title>
      <description>A six-week pilot teaching primary school children about domestic violence is completed and may now be rolled out across Wales.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-24573741</url>

      <body>A six-week pilot in Carmarthenshire teaching primary school children about domestic violence could be rolled out across Wales if funding is found. Charity Hafan Cymru's school liaison project Spectrum had only previously been used in secondary schools. Gaynor Jones, schools resource officer for the charity, said the extended scheme had proved so successful, the aim was to use it right across Wales. Pupils were taught how to recognise danger signs in relationships. Six sessions for 10 and 11 year olds were delivered in the two participating schools and one for parents and training for staff. "There are other schemes that are more therapeutic which target children who are known to be in abusive households," Ms Jones told BBC Wales. "But this is the first scheme in Wales that we know of that's been delivered to children across the whole of Years 5 and 6. "They've [the pupils] been absolutely brilliant, they've been really open, they've learnt a lot of new ideas," she added. "They've learnt a lot of new vocabulary and I think it's really important that we get that vocabulary out into the public domain. "We're hearing they're discussing it with parents at home as well and that's great, we want those messages to be carried home." In 2010, the Home Office launched a television advert campaign highlighting domestic abuse among teenagers. Last year a third of Hafan Cymru's service users were aged 16-24, and the organisation feels that preventative work in schools is key to ending domestic abuse in communities. But Ms Jones admits funding is the issue that could prevent the scheme being rolled out wider. And she is hoping that the Welsh government's White Paper about ending violence against women is legislated and will be followed up with funding which is "absolutely vital". "We know that teenagers are getting into abusive relationships younger and younger now," Ms Jones added. "We're developing a peer education project with our service users in Hafan Cymru and one of those women we're working in entered her first abusive relationship when she was 13. "So by the time children are in secondary school, it's not too late. We can still save some hopefully. "But if we can get the message out younger, that's great." </body>

      <title>Boss Mackay 'owes' Cardiff - Hammam</title>
      <description>Malky Mackay would not quit Cardiff because he owes the club for giving him the chance to be a Premier League manager, says Sam Hammam.</description>

      <body>Sam Hammam believes Malky Mackay would not walk out on Cardiff City because he owes the club for giving him the chance to be a Premier League manager. Mackay was known to be upset at club owner Vincent Tan's decision to axe head of recruitment Iain Moody. But Hammam, the club's life president, told BBC Wales' Sport Wales there is little chance of Mackay leaving. "Malky knows that he is a gem. He had to be given the chance and he wasn't getting it at Watford," Hammam said. "He had it here and he owes this club, he owes Vincent Tan, but we also owe him." Former Watford manager Mackay met the club's board on Monday after the removal of Moody, who has been replaced by 23-year-old Alisher Apsalyamov. The Kazakh was on work experience at the club in the summer and is a friend of owner Tan's son. Although Mackay had been left "bemused" and "frustrated" according to his agent Raymond Sparkes, the Scotsman had no intention of stepping down as manager. In a statement from the Cardiff board on Tuesday, the club said that transfer dealings will be conducted "subject to the manager's final approval". Hammam oversaw Cardiff's rise from the bottom division to the Championship after buying the club in 2000, relinquishing control six years later to a consortium led by Peter Ridsdale. But the Lebanese businessman was invited back as honorary life president in the summer after the club finally settled its long-standing debt with the Langston company he was a spokesman for. Hammam insisted he understood fans' fears about what Tan might decide to do next at Cardiff. But he said they had to trust in the Malaysian businessman, whose multi-million pound investment in the club helped deliver top-flight football for the first time in 51 years. "The most important thing is we should see the forest from the trees and put things in perspective," former Wimbledon owner Hammam said. "By and large Vincent Tan has been an excellent owner of the club... good servant, saved the club, put money in, expanded the stadium. "He has given us a training ground, stabilised the finances. He has done dozens of great things." Tan caused consternation among many Cardiff fans during the summer of 2012 after changing the club's colours from blue to red. Asked whether fans should be worried that Tan might look to re-name the club, Hammam admitted: "Look let's not beat around the bush... this is an issue. "We're blue and we're red, we're a Bluebird but we're a dragon and so on. "This needs to be addressed and finalised and made clear to everyone, one way or another."

      <title>Ex-mayor denies ball-bearing blast</title>
      <description>A former mayor tells a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in his home town earlier this year.</description>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor has told a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in the town. The incidents culminated in a home-made bomb being detonated under a car, scattering ball-bearings and shrapnel. John Larsen told Caernarfon Crown Court that he had played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. The 46-year-old denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. During his trial, the prosecution has claimed that there was "a strong compelling case" that Mr Larsen was the man behind the booms and blasts heard and seen in the area. One witness described how she had seen the town councillor near cars just before an explosion detonated under a Land Rover car. The blast showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident even found that one of the ball-bearings had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert told the court earlier that the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped on to the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury of even death to any passersby. But addressing Mr Larsen, his defence barrister, Gordon Hennell asked him: "Did you ever use any ball-bearings as shrapnel in a device?" "No, never," replied Mr Larsen, who had been the mayor of Denbigh in 1999. Mr Larsen told the jury that he had an interest in fireworks as one of his hobbies, alongside magic tricks. He also accepted that he had experimented with fuels for rockets. But Mr Hennell said the allegations against the defendant went further than experimentation. "The suggestion is that on March 24 you have not simply experimented, but set off an explosive device which has got ball-bearings added," he said. Larsen maintained: "No, that's incorrect. I didn't do that." Asked bluntly whether he had played any part in the night-time explosions in the Lenten Pool area, the defendant replied: "No, not at all." He told the jury that he had been at home in bed when the blasts occurred except for "a few occasions", and that he only went out late at night to check his wife's car. "It gets very rowdy at night," he added. Cross-examined by prosecution barrister, Wyn Lloyd Jones, the defendant again denied being involved in the incidents in Lenten Pool. Asked whether he wanted to distance himself "from the sheer horror of what you did", Mr Larsen replied: "No." The prosecutor said all the components for the device were in his home. But Mr Larsen described it as "standard firework material". Mr Lloyd Jones suggested the items had nothing to do with magic tricks and children's entertainment. He said Mr Larsen's interest in fireworks "became a lot more sinister." The defendant declared :"No, it didn't." Mr Larsen was arrested on 19 April 2013, and police found a mix of chemicals, modified fireworks, rockets, flares and a book on pyrotechnics at his home. He denies causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on March 24. He also denies three charges of arson in which cars were damaged, and possessing an explosive substance. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>Police have arrested 46 suspected drug dealers as part of a joint operation to reduce crime in Cardiff. The arrests come after a six-month undercover operation targeting dealers supplying Class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine in five areas. Detectives were alerted to concerns about dealing in Roath, Cathays, the city centre, Riverside and Grangetown. In three weeks, 40 men, four women and two juveniles aged between 16-55 were arrested as part of Operation Foxtrot. The arrests were across Cardiff in connection with more than 200 drug offences. A fifth woman has also been arrested for possession of CS spray. Operation Foxtrot has involved a partnership between South Wales Police, Cardiff Council and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Brown said: "Operation Foxtrot is a partnership approach to tackling drugs in our communities. "This means taking drugs off our street, putting the dealers in prison, cleaning areas where drug deals have taken place, and providing support to drug users. "During this operation we have witnessed drugs being sold openly on our streets, in parks and in subways, which quite simply will not be tolerated. "This operation is nothing more than the good people of Cardiff deserve." Anyone with information on the supply of drugs is asked to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, South Wales Police on 101, or their local officer whose contact details can be found on www.ourbobby.com </body>

Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday. Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low. Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff. They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient. Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics. "We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said. "Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB." Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school. "Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added. TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected. People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs. The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained. Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night. Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47. </body>

      <title>Anglo-French Cup will fail - Gatland</title>
      <description>Wales coach Warren Gatland believes the Anglo-French breakaway from the Heineken Cup is destined to fail.</description>

      <body>Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned that English and French clubs' attempts to set up a breakaway tournament from the Heineken Cup will fail. The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next season, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with Heineken Cup qualification and revenue sharing. "I don't see an Anglo-French competition being successful or lasting that long," Gatland told BBC Jersey. "I think all parties want full representation from all the countries." The new tournament could yet include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's (IRB) endorsement. New Zealander Gatland, who was appointed to the Wales post in 2008 after spells with London Wasps and Connacht as well as Ireland, believes a tournament that includes only English and French clubs will damage the international game in the northern hemisphere. "There needs to be some sort of protection for a Scottish or Italian team potentially," he added. "Without their involvement we could see an impact going into the Six Nations." The 50-year-old also believes that plans for the Rugby Champions Cup may have overlooked difficulties in securing officials for matches. The English Rugby Football Union (RFU) are still uncommitted to the new tournament and their French counterparts actively oppose it. "The referees are controlled by the unions and France have said they would not support a new competition, while the RFU have sort of stood on the fence," Gatland added. Quentin Smith, the chairman of England's top-level Premiership, and Tim Lopez, agent to the likes of Wales and Cardiff full-back Leigh Halfpenny, have warned that the uncertainty over top-level European rugby is affecting players' decisions over contracts at Welsh regions. </body>

All the animals were found mauled and dismembered in Gwernllwyn Terrace, Tylorstown, over an eight week period, the RSPCA said. The last animal was reported dead to the RSPCA on 30 September. The charity said the cats may have been killed by a dog and has appealed for witnesses to come forward. RSPCA inspector Selina Chan said: "This is a very distressing report and must have been incredibly upsetting for the owners to find their pets like this. "It's vital that anyone who knows anything about this horrible incident comes and talk to us in confidence. "It is likely that the animal responsible for these death is probably a large dog, but we need more information before we can take this any further." </body>

      <body>A grandfather is to net £125,000 after he placed a £50 bet on his grandson playing football for Wales - when he was 18 months old. Sixteen-year-old Harry Wilson made his international debut on Tuesday as a substitute against Belgium, becoming Wales' youngest ever senior player. His grandfather Peter Edwards, 62, was quoted odds of 2,500/1 when he placed the bet with a bookmaker in Wrexham. He is now set to retire a year earlier than originally planned. Wrexham-born Wilson came on in the 87th minute during Wales' 1-1 draw. At 16 years and 207 days, the Liverpool midfielder was 108 days younger than previous record holder Gareth Bale, now the world's most expensive footballer following his recent move to Real Madrid. There had been speculation that England were ready to try to persuade Wilson to switch international allegiance, but he opted for Wales. Mr Edwards explained how he felt when Wilson made his appearance. "I was shattered because I had to wait for 85, 86 minutes before he came on and I was panicking because they'd already substituted twice, so I thought he wasn't going to make it," he said. "But when he came on I had another glass of wine. (I was) a proud granddad first for sure. "I told my wife at half-time that my pulse was 106 - I didn't know whether that was good or bad." Mr Edwards said Wilson had showed an interest in football from a young age. "When he was about 18 months old he used to chase a ball around on the carpet before he could walk," Mr Edwards said. "I went into William Hill in Wrexham and asked them how I go about it. I had no idea how to do it and the manageress put me in touch with London." Electrical contractor Mr Edwards, of Corwen, Denbighshire, works away from home most of the year, spending one weekend a fortnight with wife Dorothy, 58. "She is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back," said Mr Edwards. "I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet." He said after Harry enrolled in the Liverpool FC academy his skills quickly developed and he returned to William Hill in the hope of placing a second bet. "Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill," he added. </body>

      <body>A wheat bag left to warm too long in a microwave is believed to have caused a fire in a 93-year-old woman's flat at a Conwy sheltered housing complex. The pensioner and two other people were taken to hospital and about 30 to 40 other residents were evacuated from flats at Rhoslan Park in Colwyn Bay. The blaze broke out at about 04:00 BST on Thursday. The Welsh Ambulance Service said the woman has been treated for smoke inhalation. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said she had been alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm and was given safety advice over the phone from fire control operators while help was mobilised. Police and ambulance staff were also called and the pensioner was led to safety to be treated by paramedics at the scene. She was then transferred to hospital as a precaution. The fire service said that other residents from the building, also as a precaution, and were safely accounted for. Two others were treated at the scene and transferred to hospital. Gwyn Jones from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted that the smoke alarm had been activated. "This alarm proved invaluable as it gave us an early warning that there was a problem at the address and enabled emergency services to respond quickly," he said. "It appears that a wheat bag left to re-heat for too long caused the fire and we are warning residents throughout north Wales who have any kind of warming device such as this to ensure that they follow the manufacturer's instructions. "We also advise not to leave any cooking unattended." </body>

      <title>Councils' cash falls by average 3.5%</title>
      <description>Councils in Wales will have their Welsh government funding cut by between 4.6 and 1.2% next year, ministers have announced.</description>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls. It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country. The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population. Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations. Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils. The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS. Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months. Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn. She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging". The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources. "I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said. "For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households." Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that. "I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me. "I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then." She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week. Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions. She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind. Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending. "The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services. "Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways. The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions". It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services. WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years. "Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised." BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes: It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%. Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before. Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups. They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax. The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money. Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements. A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February. BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes: Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze. Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work. It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that. Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions. But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down. Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council. Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce. But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency. The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private. While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities. Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services. Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations. The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties. Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks. It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples. Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do. Their track record though is far from convincing. In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments. The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well". If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards. Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged. Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations. BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes: The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities. The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund. Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru. Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13. Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment. Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer. </body>

      <title>Patient 'denied' chance to survive</title>
      <description>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog.</description>

      <body>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog. Public Services Ombudsman Peter Tyndall upheld a complaint by the family of Carl Nolan, 30, of Rhyl, who had congenital cirrhosis of the liver. Mr Nolan had been treated at Glan Clwyd hospital. Health bosses said required standards were not met but changes had been made. The ombudsman's report, which refers to Mr Nolan as Mr X, said he was born with cirrhosis of the liver and diagnosed with the "life-threatening" condition - which replaces healthy tissue with non-functioning scar tissue - in 2000 but neither he nor his family were told at the time. And although a follow-up outpatient appointment was made for him in 2001 the IT worker was not notified, said the report. He became ill again in 2008 and was given treatment but investigations to determine the cause were not concluded. It was not until he requested a second opinion that he was told he had been born with cirrhosis. The report was not able to establish why Mr Nolan had not been initially told of his condition or given advice about how he could make lifestyle changes to improve his health after diagnosis of the condition. In 2010, he was admitted to hospital several times in quick succession after becoming ill again and blood tests showed that "his liver was failing". But the hospital "sent him away, only finally admitting him three days after his appearance" with a serious infection and before finally being referred for specialist treatment. He died seven weeks later. The report said: "Had he been treated three days earlier, Mr X should have recovered from the infection and had a chance of receiving a liver transplant. This opportunity to survive and flourish was denied him." In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Tyndall said: "If he had been appropriately and promptly treated, his family are left with the knowledge that he could still be with us today. "He was a young man with his life ahead of him, a partner, a loving family, and all that was taken away. "I was shocked by what our investigation found in this instance. "This is one of the worst examples of poor treatment and poor communication with a patient that I have encountered in my time as ombudsman." He upheld the family's complaint and issued recommendations to hospital manager Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to review its "care pathway" and appointments system as well as its complaints handling process. Mr Nolan's mother Pat, a call centre supervisor, said had he been advised about his diagnosis in 2001 he could have sought and received specialist help and advice to improve his condition and could, ultimately, be alive today had he been able to receive a liver transplant. Mrs Nolan said: "This is a catalogue of errors and everybody along the line is accountable for Carl's death because they knew what he had and no one saw fit to communicate that and act upon it. "I don't know what their procedures are but something is very lax." Angela Hopkins, health board executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services, said: "The health board recognises that some of the care given was below the standard that should have been provided to the patient and family. "We fully accept the recommendations in the report and have taken action to address each one made. "We are reviewing our appointment system and process and gastroenterology care pathways to provide an improved and more robust safe service for patients. "We are also making sure that safeguard measures are implemented to improve our standards of engagement with patients while they are treated by the health service in north Wales." The ombudsman also recommended that £5,000 be paid to the family to acknowledge the "failings and provide financial redress" along with £500 for its "poor complaint handling". The report said the family wanted changes to ensure the same "mistakes are never repeated". The ombudsman can hold the institution to account but not individuals involved in the care of Mr Nolan. Hs mother has written to the General Medical Council which regulates doctors and the medical profession asking that her son's case is reviewed. "As far as I can see they seem to be above the law and not answerable to anybody and it has got to stop," she said. </body>

      <body>A dairy company has announced plans to close a Wrexham creamery with the possible loss of 231 jobs. First Milk has told staff its cheese-packing plant in Maelor could close by the end of May 2014. The firm has lost a "significant" contract with Asda and said it had informed trade unions. It will begin a staff consultation soon. The Welsh government said it was "disappointing news" and it would be meeting urgently with First Milk. A spokesman said all possible options would be examined "to try to safeguard the future of the packing facility and the jobs at Maelor". Welsh Secretary David Jones said it was a "sobering reminder of the challenges the Welsh economy still faces". "The news that there may be a significant number of job losses at the First Milk site in Wrexham will cause a great deal of concern to the workers, families and communities affected," he added. "The Wales Office is in close communication with the company and we are committed to working with the Welsh government to offer all the support we can at this difficult time." In a statement, First Milk - a co-operative owned by farmers across the UK - said it was "no longer economically viable for the business to keep the site at Maelor operational". A spokesman added: "We very much regret the need to make the proposal to close our Maelor operation. "We have a hard-working, loyal and committed workforce there and we are aware of the impact that this news will have on them. "We will of course seek to provide those potentially affected with every support and address ways in which the impact of the proposals can be reduced." The spokesman added: "As a farmer-owned co-operative, the reason we're here is to deliver sustainable returns to our members and this announcement today supports that objective." Clwyd South AM Ken Skates said: "This announcement will devastate First Milk's loyal and hard-working employees and is a major blow for the local area. "I am disappointed to see Asda end their contract with the company after the excellent service they have been shown by the workers over the years." In a statement, Asda said: "Unfortunately as part of a long-term strategic review, we have decided that from April 2014 we will be switching the supply of some of our cheese from First Milk to Arla. "We appreciate how disappointing this news will be for them but we want to reassure everyone that this decision was not taken lightly." Wrexham council leader Neil Rogers said it was a "sad day for Wrexham". He added: "Our thoughts are with those employees who are to be made redundant and their families. "It is important that Wrexham does everything it can to develop its economy by attracting new businesses into the county borough." Last year, First Milk announced £13.5m redevelopment plans which it said would safeguard 220 jobs. The firm said it needed to invest in new production facilities at the Maelor creamery to remain competitive. Wrexham councillors approved plans for the company to build a new cheese-cutting and packing centre, including offices. </body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards. Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading. It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable". It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings. The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town. Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years. Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately. The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known. It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building. A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building. "We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided." </body>

      <body>Water pipes in Welshpool are being replaced after a "flurry" of bursts cut supplies to residents and a hospital. A £250,000 project is renewing about 300m (330 yards) of pipes in Gungrog Road, near Victoria Memorial Hospital. A one-way system will be in place and Severn Trent Water has apologised for any disruption. It is hoped the new pipes will be working by next month. Last month, some homes were temporarily without water and the hospital lost its supply twice in three days. The hospital's new kidney dialysis unit needs 1,200 litres of water every hour when running at full capacity. Severn Trent said it expected the renewed pipes to be working by the end of November. Dave Kiernan, the firm's programme manager, said: "The water pipes in Gungrog Road have served the local community for a very long time. "Their age and the increased demand for water has led to the recent bursts, causing interruptions to our customers' water supply and the service we provide." He said the work had been planned as part of a bigger project but was being brought forward because of a flurry of problems experienced at the hospital and Gungrog Infants School. The company said most of the work outside the school was planned for half term week to "minimise disruption". </body>

      <body>A number of Premier League clubs are introducing reciprocal deals to reduce the price of tickets for away fans. Newcastle United have agreed deals with West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City, while the Welsh club have a further agreement in place with Hull City. Magpies finance director John Irving said: "We believe the right way to encourage people to attend is to look at charging reasonable prices." Premier League clubs were each given £200,000 to subsidise travelling fans. Swansea fans will pay a reduced price of £20 for adults and £5 for concessions at Hull and Newcastle, with the same prices in place for the return fixtures at the Liberty Stadium. Travelling supporters from Newcastle and West Brom will both pay £15 for adults and £5 for concessions when their teams face each other. Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen hopes more agreements can be made. "I'm glad to see that things have slowly started to gather pace," he said. "We are in constant dialogue with other clubs in the Premier League and hope to announce additional reciprocal deals over the course of the campaign. "We are determined to help keep the costs down for travelling supporters; not just for our own loyal fans, but those supporters of other clubs around the country as well." Away attendances have declined by 10% over the past five seasons and the Football Supporters' Federation  has said the cost of tickets is a major concern. A 2013 BBC study of the costs of football found the average prices of the most expensive season ticket and highest and lowest match-day prices in the Premier League had fallen by up to 5.3%. </body>

      <body>Scarlets tight-head prop Samson Lee has been banned for two weeks following the incident that led to his sin-binning in their 33-26 win at Harlequins last weekend. Lee's boot struck Quins scrum-half Danny Care's face at a ruck. Uncapped 20-year-old Lee was banned until Monday, 28 October. That rules him out of the Scarlets' Heineken Cup clash against Racing Metro on Saturday and the 25 October Pro12 clash at Zebre. French citing commissioner Jean-Claude Legendre referred the incident to the competition's disciplinary officials. Irish referee John Lacey sin-binned Lee and the player's case was considered by Scottish judicial officer Rod McKenzie. McKenzie determined Lee was going for the ball, but in doing so, the player's boot "made contact with Care's face in a reckless manner, and that in his opinion, the offence warranted a red card". An ERC statement read: "He [McKenzie] found that the act was at the low-end entry point of the IRB's [International Rugby Board's] sanctioning regime [two weeks] and although there were no aggravating factors, and although Lee had a clean record, the player had pleaded not guilty and therefore, no mitigation was possible in this case." The IRB recommended minimum sanctions for foul play are two weeks for a low range offence, five weeks for a mid range, and nine to 52 weeks for a high end. </body>

      <body>Thieves have taken a haul of "irreplaceable" rugby shirts from a rugby club which has been hit by a spate of break-ins. A number nine jersey donated to Maesteg Rugby Club, near Bridgend, by former international Rob Howley was among the stolen memorabilia. The thieves also stole a rugby league shirt worn by veteran Kevin Ellis. South Wales Police are investigating the break-ins and officers have not ruled out a link between the three. The burglaries are the latest misfortune to hit the club. Memorabilia was destroyed in an arson attack on the main clubhouse in August shortly after it had been refurbished. The clubhouse's first-floor members' lounge was partially destroyed and other areas of the building suffered smoke and water damage. The property's electrical system was badly damaged, as was its cellar and steelwork on the stadium's stand. The main clubhouse building was targeted on Saturday and Sunday when a quantity of alcohol and confectionery was stolen. In the third burglary, thieves forced their way into the building some time between Monday afternoon and early Tuesday morning and took the rugby shirts. "The Rob Howley shirt in particular would hold a reasonable value for the thieves," said PC Viv Price. "The shirts are irreplaceable and mean a great deal to the club and its members. "I am appealing to anyone who may be offered any of these jerseys for sale or has any relevant information to come forward." Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. </body>

      <title>Bellamy admits emotional retirement</title>
      <description>Wales midfielder Craig Bellamy admits it was an emotional end to his international career after the 1-1 draw in Belgium.</description>

      <body>Craig Bellamy bowed out of international football admitting it was an emotional finish to his 78-cap Wales career. The 34-year-old, who scored 19 goals during 15 years as an international, played in Tuesday night's 1-1 draw in Belgium. He revealed the Welsh national anthem brought home his retirement. "You do think: 'This is probably the last time I'm going to be in this position as a player,'" said Bellamy. "To soak in your national anthem. I'm speechless about it, but it is really nice. It's something I do cherish. "It did hit home a bit that I'm not going to be this side of it again. "I've enjoyed every second of it. To reach 78 [caps] and the injuries I've had down the years. I'm delighted." Bellamy did question whether it was right to have given 16-year-old Harry Wilson his debut on Tuesday and prevent England having claims on him. The Liverpool Academy midfielder came on in the 87th minute against Belgium to become Wales' youngest ever player. "Sixteen is young. He can't play for anyone else now. Is that really the most important thing? "I think he's a talent and I think he's going to do well in the years. But I'd like to see him do well first." But Bellamy also admitted that seeing Wilson become the youngest ever Wales player, beating Gareth Bale's previous record by 108 days, put his own age into perspective. "He [Wilson] is my boy's age, so probably [it brought] home to me how old I am," said Bellamy, who made his Wales debut against Jamaica in 1998. Bellamy's retirement coincided with the end of Wales' 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign which saw them finish fifth in Group A, which contained six teams. In their 10 games Wales recorded three wins, six defeats and a draw. But Bellamy, who has hinted one day he would like to manage Wales, says the future is bright for Welsh international football. "It's a good generation. A lot of them had potential but a lot have come to the fore and are fulfilling it," he said. On the draw with Belgium, ranked sixth in the world, Bellamy added: "It was a decent result. It was difficult especially when they went 1-0 up. Obviously James [Collins] going off was a bit of a blow to us we needed as much experience as we could. "We found an extra gear in the last 10-15 minutes. It was a nice way to go out." </body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned. The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms. But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize. The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable. Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two. Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home. But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties. The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation. "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize. "If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy." It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure". It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved. It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level. The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents. "Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls." This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies. Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction. Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation. "There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to. "We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added. A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms. "However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales." The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was. Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns. </body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown. There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year. The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades". The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995. However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled. The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police. The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded. An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year. Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats. The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen. Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year. The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud. Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family. "But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity. "While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable." While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges". He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels. "While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online." Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling. "This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public. "England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues." The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales. </body>

      <description>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies says.</description>

      <body>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader has suggested. Andrew RT Davies said the BBC has a "near monopoly" on reporting devolution and should be scrutinised by Welsh politicians. This, he said, would make senior management and editors accountable for the actions they and their teams take. UK ministers said there was a "net benefit" to all parts of the United Kingdom in not devolving broadcasting. Neither AMs or the Welsh government currently have functions relating to broadcasting. The BBC Trust is a UK wide body to oversee the BBC, although there is an Audience Council in Wales which "scrutinises the BBC's services on behalf of BBC audiences in Wales". Mr Davies told an audience in Aberystwyth: "The editorial decisions that are taken in Wales not just on politics but on how Wales is reported must be scrutinised by the most important democratically elected body in Wales." He also warned the BBC's ability to "extend its reach in news" through online services is "perhaps to the detriment of other news outlets who usually need advertising revenues or online charging schemes to pay for anywhere near like for like presence". "In the Welsh context, it is near on impossible for a competitor to emerge because of the dominance of the BBC's website - it is free, extensive and accessible on portable devices." Mr Davies has written to Culture Secretary Maria Miller to argue that the future governance of the BBC in Wales should be considered during the charter renewal process in 2017. However, this call from Mr Davies is at odds with the current position of the UK government. In its submission to the second part of the Silk Commission considering further powers for the assembly, the Wales Office said: "There are good reasons why broadcasting was not devolved in the devolution settlements and there is no evidence to suggest that devolution of broadcasting policy or a different approach to funding the BBC would benefit licence fee payers. "There is a greater net benefit to the nation and all its constituent parts in having broadcasting reserved." A spokesman for the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport restated this position on Wednesday, saying Mr Davies's suggestion was not being considered. In a statement the BBC Trust said: "The BBC is accountable to licence fee payers across the UK through the BBC Trust. "In Wales, the national trustee Elan Closs Stephens represents the interests of Welsh licence fee payers and the trust is advised about the BBC's performance by the Audience Council Wales. "The Welsh assembly is involved in the process of appointing the national trustee." In a separate submission to the commission, the Welsh Conservative assembly group agreed key decisions on broadcasting in Wales should remain the responsibility of UK ministers. But the document also called for a "mechanism of joint accountability" to both the assembly and the UK parliament, so devolved matters such as the Welsh language could be addressed better. Mr Davies also called for an end to the block grant system, by which the UK Treasury funds the Welsh government, where he says "a cheque is sent down the M4 and simply cashed, and usually more demanded on top". On Wednesday the prime minister refused to say when new tax and borrowing powers, recommended by the first part of the Silk Commission, would be implemented in Wales. In his speech Mr Davies acknowledged David Cameron's view that those involved in politics in Cardiff Bay are "obsessed with constitutional tinkering" but blame a "poor" original devolution settlement that has left many policy makers discussing the constitution rather than policy. </body>

      <title>Coleman should commit, says Yorath</title>
      <description>Former Wales manager Terry Yorath calls on current boss Chris Coleman to speak out if he wants to continue in the role.</description>

      <body>Former Wales manager Terry Yorath has called on current boss Chris Coleman to speak out if he wants to continue in the role. Coleman has said he has not decided if he wants to carry on as manager after his contract expires in November. But Yorath wants Coleman to make his feelings known before November's friendly against Finland. "I think Chris should stay with the job and I think the Welsh FA should back him," he said. Wales ended their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high with a 1-0 win over Macedonia and a 1-1 draw in Belgium. Football Association of Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford had stated Coleman's new contract would not hinge solely on the final two World Cup qualifiers. The FAW has been in ongoing contract talks with the 43-year-old, who was appointed in January 2012 on a two-and-a-half-year contract following the death of Gary Speed. Yorath was Coleman's club manager at Swansea City before he handed the defender his international debut against Austria in 1992. "I've talked to Chris, I think three times in the last 10 days, and he sounds to me as if he's a bit unsure about his situation," Yorath added. "During my talks with him he was telling me certain things that were happening and I felt he was unsure whether he wanted to keep the job. "I think if he wants to keep the job he has to come out and say that. "It's the best job you'll ever have, managing your country, and he has to come out and say he wants to do it." Yorath was Wales manager for five years and led the national side to the brink of the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States. Following Wales' failure to qualify, Yorath's contract was not renewed by the FAW in December 2013. And the former Leeds United midfielder has every sympathy for Coleman as he waits for clarity from the FAW about his future. "Dealing with the Welsh FA is, at the most, awkward because you've got people who think they know everything about football but don't know anything about it," Yorath added. "They don't understand the situation the manager's in. "The manager's in a situation where two or three days before a game players pull out. You can't do anything about that. It's not like a club job. "I think the last two games Chris has done ever so well. The game against Belgium I thought Wales played excellent. "I honestly thought before the game Wales were going to get hammered and I probably wasn't the only one. "But they played well, stuck it out and got a draw and a great result for Chris." </body>

      <title>Euro doubt 'sways' Osprey Evans</title>
      <description>Lions and Wales lock Ian Evans would consider leaving Ospreys if they were not in a competition like the Heineken Cup.</description>

      <body>Ospreys lock Ian Evans would consider leaving the Welsh region if they were not competing in the Heineken Cup. The British and Irish Lions and Wales international, 29, is in the final year of his contract with Ospreys. English and French clubs plan to quit the Heineken Cup for a new tournament, which may include Pro12 teams. "If that competition wasn't to go ahead I think it would be a massive sway to the way your future is going to pan out," he said. "You need that intensity. I think the Heineken Cup is just below international rugby and you need play that week in week out if you've got any international aspirations. "There's no room for error really and it's pushing you as a person." Evans was in the unfamiliar position of being dropped for the Heineken Cup opener against Leinster, which ended in a 19-9 home defeat, and is a doubt to face Northampton this Sunday because of injury. But the 6ft 8in forward said if he was not being selected for big games then that could also have a bearing on his future. "Last week I more or less wasn't selected and obviously that was very disappointing," Evans said. "It's probably been the worst week that I've been involved in rugby for a long, long time and I was really disappointed not to be involved. "This week I've got a niggling Achilles injury and I'm just trying to make sure that's right. "It is a massive shock [not to get selected], not that I take away anything from the competition - I think James King [who faced Leinster at lock] has been playing extremely well." Ospreys have lost a number of high-profile players to France in recent years, including Wales stars Mike Phillips, Lee Byrne and James Hook. The Welsh region's chief executive, Andrew Hore, admitted in August that the region could find it hard to keep hold of some of their Lions stars. Lions and Wales tight-head prop Adam Jones has started negotiations with the region over a new deal but admitted he would consider a move to France. The contract of Evans' fellow lock Alun Wyn Jones also expires at the end of the 2013-14 season. Evans added: "The Heineken Cup's the biggest games, that's what you build into and if you're not involved in them then what else are you meant to do, with one year left on your contract? "I haven't had any offers as such yet, but I suppose things will start coming my way hopefully sooner or later. "[Going abroad] would not appeal to me, but first and foremost my wife is about to give birth at the end of November and I'm quite a family-orientated person, but I want to play competitive rugby." Meanwhile, defeat by Leinster left Ospreys with an uphill struggle in this weekend's second-round match at Northampton. "To lose your home game has put us under a lot of pressure really, but there's one thing for sure, I think the boys react under pressure," Evans said. "Northampton lost out in Castres and playing in front of their home crowd and with the team they've got, I think it'll be a great competition to see who is going to come out on top." </body>

      <body>Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has said Wales's youngest player Harry Wilson is not ready for the Premier League. The Liverpool academy player, 16, made his full international debut as an 87th-minute substitute in Tuesday's 1-1 World Cup qualifier draw with Belgium - beating Gareth Bale's record. Rodgers said Wilson is a "very talented young player", but added: "He's not near [playing in] the Premier League. "I was surprised. Obviously Wales had a lot of injuries." Rodgers said he was informed of Wilson's inclusion in the squad by Liverpool and Wales goal-scoring legend Ian Rush. Wales manager Chris Coleman had turned to the youngster after injuries disrupted preparations for the final World Cup qualifiers. Wrexham-born Wilson was an unused substitute for last Friday's 1-0 win over Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium before making his debut in Brussels. "To have him here at the club is brilliant," Rodgers added. "He knows he will have a great opportunity here if he continues to develop at Liverpool. "It's important that we just stay calm and let him develop at his own rate." Wilson earning a Wales cap also saw his granddad win £125,000 from a £50 bet placed in when the teenager was 18 months old. </body>

Patient advocate Julia Black told BBC Wales the system must be made fairer as there is a "huge disparity" between which drugs patients can access depending on where they live. Her comments came after Wales' Chief Medical Officer Ruth Hussey said the system for giving cancer drugs in Wales needs to get better. An investigation by the BBC's The Wales Report had found that patients in Wales with the same type of cancer are getting different levels of care. The Welsh government said its statistics speak for themselves and behind the issue lie many large pharmaceutical companies, who have a vested interest in promoting their products. </body>

      <body>The body responsible for amateur boxing in Wales is "not fit for purpose" and "does not qualify for public funding", an independent audit report says. The Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) says the audit found no evidence of fraudulent activity, But its chairman said it would take all the steps recommended to put things right. Sports Wales said it would continue funding the association, but it had put special measures in place. The report into the activities of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA) was commissioned by the association, alongside the Welsh government and Sports Wales which oversees and promotes sport and advises the government. The audit was carried out by accountancy firm, KTS Owens Thomas. In their report, which has been published in a redacted form on WABA's website, the auditors said: "It is our view that in its current state WABA is not fit for purpose and does not qualify to receive public money. "Sport Wales must consider the implications of this finding. "We consider that with the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report, WABA will become fit for purpose and qualify to receive public money." In 2012, WABA received grant support from Sports Wales of just over £190,000 - more than double its £89,000 grant in 2006. The audit report lists a series of financial concerns: The report also raises issues over the way the association has been run since becoming a limited company in 2003. It noted: "Some members have expressed concern that WABA is not open to constructive challenge and there appears to be divisions in the membership. "Overall, we have found corporate governance to be poor and dysfunctional. We consider that it is improving, but has not reached an acceptable level." The auditors make 38 recommendations for the sporting body's future, including measures to tighten financial controls, banking systems, and expenses management. Their report also calls on the board to "improve the culture at WABA", and to work with Sports Wales to ensure it follows an action plan to implement the recommendations. 'Simply not acceptable' Responding to the report, WABA chairman Terry Smith told BBC Wales: "Obviously we are very disappointed, but we will take all the steps recommended to put things right as quickly as possible." He said much of the organisation was run by unpaid volunteers who did not have formal financial training. But he disputed some of the report's findings, including the issue of unsupported spending. Sports Wales said WABA's failures were "simply not acceptable". Chief executive, Sarah Powell, said an action plan was now in place to resolve the issues at WABA. She added: "In the best interests of the sport's grass-roots participants and elite competitors, Sport Wales has decided to continue funding WABA, but has put in place special measures to protect public funds, until such time as satisfactory progress has been made on the recommendations." </body>

      <description>Former game advisor urges more concussion protection</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said. The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia. Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players. He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this. He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees. Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players. "They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do." The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB. It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game. In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously". "This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message. "Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers. "Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element." The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board. "We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times." A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team. Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing. He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital. His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch. "At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said. "He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles. "It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today." Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK. And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers. "I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added. "Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children. "We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way." The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research. "Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <description>How will cash-strapped Welsh councils save money?</description>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government. It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year. Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms. Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16. So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls: Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard. "It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable." Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents. "The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services. "We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future." Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services. "The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course. "We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15. "The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council. Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions. "This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government. "The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner. "We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration. "However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect." A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement. "Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years." Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October. The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years. Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities. The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need. It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils. However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely. Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation. Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched. Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months. Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected. "This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said. "We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further. "However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs. "I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget." Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings. "Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups. "Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected." A spokesman for Ceredigion said: "Unfortunately, no decisions have been made." In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year. "Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'." A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it. "The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions. "Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months. "Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year. "The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement. "On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas. "We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed." The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is: Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability. "It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling. "These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'. "We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months. "Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position." The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers. A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible." A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15. "Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m. "This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year. "We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents." BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Merthyr Tydfil council. Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government. "Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level. "We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population. "We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding. "We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut. "We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years." The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks. Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy. It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services. Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off. Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December. A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon." A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years). A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be. A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000. A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government". "The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson. "The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'. "The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound. "Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk. "A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year." Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales. "As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible. "I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges. "The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting." The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year. It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure. Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending. "We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times. "However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said. Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15. Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%. "Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16. "We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse. "This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs. "Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care. "The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions. "We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties." Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable. "This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week. "Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m. "Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts. "Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months. "In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services. "My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives. "In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide. "Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities." Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts. Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year. Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year. Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend. Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations. The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017. Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services. Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making. "This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide." He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views." Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea. Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December. The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years. Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered. It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made. The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. "Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions. "We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for." The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall. It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services. It is due to meet to discuss proposals. Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham. "In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care. "But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago. "Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come. "Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult." With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible". The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. "Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required. It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost." Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include: </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H.habilis. But many features from the braincase were also unique to H.erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has unveiled the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remains known anywhere in the world. They are also the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group which emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection, it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation which had previously puzzled archaeologists, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. Their comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now." "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H.erectus, H.habilis and H.rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H.erectus, and not present in H.habilis and H.rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils can be "lumped into an evolving H.erectus lineage". "Only H.Erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>
      <description>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa.

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Badger cull falls short of target</title>
      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Nobel winner Higgs plans to retire</title>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <body>Scientists are asking for the public's help to track the spread of a greedy slug species threatening to eat its way through British gardens and crops. The Spanish slug was first reported in the UK in January by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. It can survive many slug pellets, eats crops spared by native species and tolerate drier conditions. A red-brown colour, pale or rich, can identify a suspected Spanish slug. Scientists fear it could breed with our native species to form a hybrid. The Iberian invader, Arion vulgaris, can reproduce in greater numbers and has unappealing habits, including eating dead animals and excrement. During the winter, many disappeared underground or died but their eggs survived and the species may have returned in greater numbers. Scientists are asking people to look for the slugs under logs and plant pots in their gardens, and record and photograph their findings using a dedicated SlugWatch website. "We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug has become," said Dr Bedford. "The reports may also give us an idea of whether it is breeding with our native species to form a hybrid combining the worst of the Spanish slug with tolerance to frosts and cold from our own species." Keith Norman, technical director of farming company Velcourt, said farmers were using up their entire allowance of slug pellets early in the season, leaving no other means of control. "It is a disaster waiting to happen if the Spanish slug proliferates and establishes itself in the UK," said Mr Norman. "The Spanish slug causes more eating damage and cannot be controlled with existing measures." The Slugwatch website was designed by Rachel Ayers, 17, a sixth-former at at Notre Dame High School. Norwich. She also designed cards identifying different species of slug for use in schools. "We want people to survey their gardens, local areas and school grounds for slugs, or they can build a trap using instructions on the site," she said. "One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning about slugs and how to identify them," said Rachel. There are 30 native species in the UK, four of which are classed as pests: the netted or grey field slug, the garden slug, the keeled slug and the large black slug. Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem. They are natural composters, breaking down vegetation, and provide food for hedgehogs, toads and some garden birds. "We hope that as well as helping with research into the Spanish slug, people will learn a bit about the biology of these molluscs," said Dr Bedford. "You never know, we may even help inspire someone to become a malacologist in the future." </body>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease. The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden". The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care. Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease. The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009. The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs. Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro. Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease. An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe. Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer. One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment." Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas. "More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates." Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden. "This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness. "We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care." </body>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <description>A major archaeological dig unearths evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, some 8,000 years before France, organisers say.</description>

      <body>A major archaeological dig in Wiltshire has unearthed evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, 8,000 years before France, it has been claimed. The team, which consists of Mesolithic period experts, also found other types of food including salmon and nuts. David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, said people living there thousands of years ago were eating a "Heston Blumenthal-style menu". The team hopes to confirm Amesbury as the UK's oldest continuous settlement. The dig will run until 25 October. It is being filmed and made into a documentary by the BBC, Smithsonian, CBC and others to be screened at a later date. The project is being led by the University of Buckingham. Mr Jacques added: "This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?" The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum. He examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the Mesolithic era. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created. "No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area," he said. "There must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, may well be it. "I believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most significant Mesolithic home base ever found in Britain." He added: "Currently Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the UK with Amesbury 104 years younger. "By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered." The site already boasts the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north west Europe. The term Mesolithic refers to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic periods. </body>

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Hundreds of illegal waste sites shut</title>
      <description>The Environment Agency says that it is shutting down 25 illegal waste sites every week.</description>

      <body>The number of illegal waste sites being shut down has increased by 70% in the past 12 months, according to the Environment Agency. Some 1,279 locations were identified and closed in 2012/13, according to its Waste Crime Report. However, construction waste continues to be a problem, while scrap cars were found at a quarter of all illegal sites. And the number of successful prosecutions was down by 30%. The legitimate waste and recycling industry currently generates over £12bn every year in the UK, and employs about 128,000 people. Illegal operators, on the other hand, usually offer to dispose of waste at extremely low prices, and are said to be diverting up to £1bn per year from legitimate businesses. Often the waste is buried or burned with no safeguards for the environment. As well as infestations of flies and acrid smoke, it can lead to serious pollution incidents. While local authorities deal with most cases of fly-tipping, the Environment Agency deals with larger-scale dumping and illegal exports of waste. Two years ago, it set up an illegal waste taskforce. Its latest report states that, over the past 12 months, it closed down an average of 25 of these sites every week. "We've shut more sites down faster than ever," said Mat Crocker, head of waste at the agency. "We put additional resources to it, we got more people in with the right skill sets, and we've also targeted our efforts at the right people so we can deal with it faster." While the number of sites being closed down is at record levels, the number of successful prosecutions for waste crime is down to its lowest level in four years. In 2102/13, 171 prosecutions were completed, leading to five custodial sentences. In 2011/12, there were 249 prosecutions with 10 ending in jail terms. "We target our prosecutions at the most serious offenders," Mat Crocker explained. "Quite often by providing clear information and following it up with the right type of encouragement, people stop. "Prosecution is just one of the tools in the bag, really." One feature of large-scale waste business is that dumpers are often clustered around key motorway links near London and in the North West. The agency identified 820 active sites in March this year - the vast majority around these pivotal transport routes. It also carried out inspections on shipping containers in an attempt to curb the illegal export of waste. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

      <title>Elephants 'understand human gesture'</title>
      <description>African elephants demonstrate what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.</description>

      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists. In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat. From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket. The results are published in the journal Current Biology. The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe. Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding. "They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne. "The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words." Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so. In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task. Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture. "Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said. "But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything. "It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised." Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans. "They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution." The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size". But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks". Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point." </body>

      <body>Young bonobos that are are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from psychological studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. It is published in the journal PNAS. Among their hours of footage, the researchers captured this clip showing one of the "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug another juvenile that had just been attacked. </body>

      <body>Environment secretary Owen Paterson has signed an open letter calling for the immediate rollout of "Golden Rice" - rice genetically modified to contain vitamin A - which it claimed could save the lives of 670,000 people a year. Mr Paterson claims groups opposing the GM crops are "wicked" - but is he right? In an interview from BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire, Helen Wallace from Gene Watch claimed that there are better, more cost-effective ways to solve the problem of vitamin A deficiency. Dr Robert Zigler, director of the International Rice Research Institute in Manila - a non-profit, independent body involved in developing Golden Rice - said that some campaigners exercise "an aggressive manipulation of half-truths". </body>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military instillations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic is a mineral and as a poison it is almost unrivalled. It is tasteless, dissolves in hot water and it takes less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, it was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And arsenic - the murderer's friend - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24466042</url>
      <date>1381536819</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70385000/png/_70385861_vlcsnap-2013-10-09-11h43m13s97.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."

      <description>Progress in science has never observed national borders</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064</url>

      <body>Science can only develop by ignoring national borders, says Lisa Jardine. Since its modern beginnings in the 17th Century, science has been the most global of pursuits. Information and experimentation have criss-crossed national borders, as the curious have tried to explain the properties of natural phenomena. Marie Curie, discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel prizes, put the matter characteristically bluntly: "Science is essentially international. It is only through lack of a historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it." Not that you would think so if you have followed the science news this week. As the Nobel prizes for 2013 have been announced, each nation's media have rushed to claim the winners as their own. "Three Americans win joint Nobel prize for medicine," shouted the headline in the New York Times. "A German and two Americans win the Nobel prize for medicine," counter-claimed Der Spiegel. One of this year's winners is indeed German born and trained, though he has worked for many years in the United States. On Tuesday the prize for physics went, as expected, to Britain's (or should that be Scotland's) Peter Higgs. Of the five other physicists who could lay claim to having made crucial early theoretical breakthroughs in relation to the Higgs-Boson particle, it was Francois Englert of Belgium alone who shared the prize with Higgs. Predictably, every Belgian newspaper I consulted on Wednesday morning ran a banner headline along the lines of "Belgian wins Nobel prize for physics", relegating Higgs to the second or third paragraph. Higgs and Englert published their theories of how certain particles acquire mass independently in 1964 - Higgs working in Edinburgh, and Englert and his long-term colleague Robert Brout in Brussels. It has been characteristic of advances in science since the beginning that a single problem is worked on - and ultimately solved at about the same time - by individuals and teams in different countries, who read the same papers, correspond and meet intermittently at academic conferences. An example on a much more modest scale from the period closest to my own heart as a historian, the 17th Century, is the investigation of a phenomenon known today as Prince Rupert's drops. As it happens, this too linked scientists in Britain and the Low Countries. If a globule of molten glass is dropped into a bucket of cold water, it cools to form a tear-shaped drop of a size that fits into the palm of your hand with a long, slender tail. This tadpole-shaped drop has extraordinary properties. The main body of the tear is remarkably strong - you can stand on it, or hit it with a hammer, without it breaking. But if the tiniest fragment is broken from the tail, the entire drop shatters and explodes with a loud bang, disintegrating into dust - watch one shatter in this clip from Smarter Every Day on YouTube. This combination of strength and weakness, and its potential explosive possibilities, demanded an explanation. Prince Rupert's drops seem first to have attracted scientific interest in Germany in the 1640s. By the 1650s they were being examined and discussed in France and the Netherlands, with a whole range of theories being produced concerning the drop's strange properties. One of the earliest recorded attempts at an explanation involved the Dutch polymath Sir Constantijn Huygens and the amateur scientist Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle. Cavendish was domiciled in Antwerp at the time, exiled from Britain during the Commonwealth period. In a letter to her following a visit, Huygens recorded a conversation they had about the drops - at the time known as "Dutch tears" - in her private chemistry laboratory. There, each week, she apparently "dirtied several white petticoats" worn as overalls to protect her clothing while she conducted experiments. Enclosing several specimens, Huygens begs her to investigate their properties. "The King of France is as yet unresolved in the question, notwithstanding he hath been curious to move it to an assembly of the best philosophers of Paris." The duchess replied a week later. She expressed her gratitude to Huygens for seeking her opinion. In her view, the cause of the explosion when the tip of the drop was broken was that there was a tiny quantity of volatile material trapped inside which reacted violently on contact with air. With a nice feminine touch, she observed that if liquid had somehow been inserted into the drops (actually, the drops contain no liquid) it would have required no greater skill than that employed to make fashionable glass earrings. "Women wear at their ears for pendants as great wonders, glass bobs with narrow necks as these glasses have tails, and yet it is filled with several colours silks and coarse black cotton-wool, which to my sense is more difficult to put into these glass pendants, than liquor into these glass guns." The correspondence continued for some weeks, though neither party could come up with anything like an acceptable explanation. In 1661, the properties of the "glass bubbles" were demonstrated at a meeting of the recently formed Royal Society in London. Several of its founding members had recently returned from continental Europe at the Restoration of Charles II - including the king's German cousin Prince Rupert, who gave his name to the drops. So it is not surprising that specimens of what diarist Samuel Pepys called "Chymicall glasses" came with them. "The king sent by Sir Paul Neile five little glass bubbles," the minutes of the meeting record, "in order to have the judgement of the society concerning them." Anxious to impress the king (whose financial support the society was actively seeking) the members responded immediately. More drops were produced and experimented on two days later, and a full report of the experiments given to the society at its weekly meeting by the president. These were shared with the French traveller Balthasar de Monconys when he attended the Royal Society. He made his own French translation of the report, and discussed the drops and their properties with the scientific community in Leiden when he visited shortly afterwards. It was my scientific hero Robert Hooke, the society's curator of experiments - the person in charge of those experiments recorded in 1661 - who made an important early contribution to explaining this strange phenomenon, based on the differential cooling of the glass itself after it was plunged into water, and drawing an analogy with the way the locked stones in brick arches collapse instantaneously and violently once the keystone is removed. Hooke used his new microscope to examine drops which had been shattered, but held intact with strong glue. His contributions to a theoretical explanation cover 11 closely-argued pages in his 1665 Micrographia. In the 19th Century the great Lord Kelvin added his contribution. But the behaviour of these "Dutch tears" was not fully explained until the 1920s. So multiple connections between at least four European nations contributed to the eventual properly scientific understanding of "Prince Rupert's drops". I might add that Margaret Cavendish's involvement in the story is not her only appearance in early modern science. Pepys described in his diary a sensational London social event in 1667, when the duchess paid a ceremonial visit to the Royal Society at the invitation of its president and fellows - the only woman to do so before the modern era. Among the experiments carried out for her were several involving Robert Boyle's famous "evacuating engine" or air pump. It is tempting for the historian to claim landmark events in science on behalf of the nation to which he or she belongs. I have come close to doing as much myself, when I hinted that Hooke might have been the first to provide an explanation for the behaviour of Prince Rupert's drops. Brian Cox begins his recent Science Britannica TV series by announcing: "In these films I want to explore Britain's pivotal role in creating modern science." But science has always ignored national borders, in pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of nature. Even at the height of the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-17th Century, correspondence full of information and data continued to be exchanged uncensored between Dutch scientists and the Royal Society in London. Higgs and Englert have been quick to point out that the crucial experimental work at CERN that confirmed their Nobel-prize winning theoretical breakthrough was the result of global teamwork, involving thousands of researchers and almost 100 nationalities. To be true to the benefits of a scientific future we have to honour its equally international past. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>
