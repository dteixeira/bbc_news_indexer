      <body>Chartered surveyors have called for urgent action to cope with "soaring demand" from house buyers. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), also indicated that not enough houses are coming on to the market. Rics said that "rocketing interest" from potential buyers was "dwarfing" the number of properties for sale. In the meantime, official figures out later are expected to show UK house prices hitting another record high. The comments from Rics accompanied the results of its latest monthly survey of its members. It measured the opinion of 300 chartered surveyors across the country. In October those reporting price rises outnumbered those reporting no rises by the highest margin since 2002. The government's Help to Buy scheme is one reason for that, said Rics. But it warned that a lack of houses being put up for sale is proving problematic. "The amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand," said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist of Rics. "In order for the market to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed." he said. By contrast, the survey shows declining interest from people wanting to rent accommodation. The proportion of surveyors reporting a rise in interest from potential tenants was at its lowest for a decade. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) out later are expected to show UK house prices at a new record high. Last month the ONS reported that prices across the country are higher than at any time since the survey began in 1968. It said prices were rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but were falling in Scotland. However, the Land Registry has reported that the average house price in England and Wales is £167,063, which is still 8% below its peak in November 2007. </body>

      <title>Davey: Energy users 'not cash cows'</title>
      <description>Gas and electricity customers should not be "cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say.</description>

      <body>Gas and electricity customers are "not just cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say. In a speech later, the Liberal Democrat minister will call on the industry to "open up your books" to show how it is trying to minimise tariffs. Millions of customers face price rises for gas and electricity this winter. But industry body Energy UK complained that a "tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults" was developing. Four of the UK's six main energy companies have recently announced price rises, with an average increase of 9.1%, and the other two are expected to follow suit soon. The firms say the rises are largely due to increasing wholesale prices, but critics say they are unfair and will lead households into difficulties with bills. In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. He has accused the coalition of doing too little to help keep tariffs down. But the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In his speech to the annual conference of Energy UK, which represents the industry, in London on Tuesday, Mr Davey will argue that companies need to make enough money to invest in greener technologies. He will add: "But those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. "Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. "It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up." Mr Davey will say: "Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks." He will tell companies: "You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public - and the public must have trust in what you do." Mr Davey will say the government is looking at how to reduce the impact of its policies on bills, adding: "But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible." He will also tell industry leaders they face a "Fred the Shred" moment, in reference to the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood after leading the bank to near-collapse in 2008. But Labour's shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said: "David Cameron's out-of-touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis." "Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. "It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say." Energy UK, meanwhile, said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. "The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. "As analysis from UBS shows, about 95% of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs." </body>

      <body>Vodafone has reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £1.5bn ($2.4bn) as it said trading in Europe remained "very tough at present". Chief executive Vittorio Colao said he had seen "intense macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures during the period" there. But he was "encouraged" by forecasts that Europe would return to growth. Mr Colao said the emerging markets businesses were doing well thanks to the smartphone. He said he hoped for a shift in regulation to support industry investment and consolidation. Mr Colao said mature markets were "challenging", but that focusing on cost efficiency was helping. Vodafone said it plans to spend £7bn on its networks, after the sale of its US business. </body>

      <title>Apple and Samsung back in court</title>
      <description>Apple and Samsung are heading back to court in a row over damages awarded in a patent action.</description>

      <body>Apple and Samsung are returning to court in one of the most high-profile patent battles of recent times. In August 2012, a jury found Samsung guilty of infringing six Apple patents and awarded one of the largest payouts of its kind on record. The verdict and $1bn (£626m) awarded in damages were seen as a massive victory for Apple. This is just one of many patent cases the two companies are fighting in courtrooms across the world. In March 2013, a judge re-examined the $1bn awarded to Apple and reduced the amount saying the damages would need to be assessed at a new trial. Judge Lucy Koh said the original jury in the court in California had incorrectly calculated part of the damages. The judge said that $550m of the award had been worked out in the proper manner but she ordered that the remaining $450m be reassessed. That $450m could be increased or lowered meaning that Apple could conceivably end up with more than the original $1bn awarded at the first trial. Apple had originally sought $2.5bn in damages from Samsung. It argued that the South Korean company had copied its designs for the bodies of the original iPhone and iPad as well as user-interface elements such as the bounce-back response when a person scrolls beyond the end of list and tap-to-zoom. Samsung argued it was already working on rounded rectangular handsets dominated by a screen and a single button months before the iPhone was revealed. It sought $519m in damages from Apple. At the time of the original ruling Samsung said the decision was bad news for consumers and would "lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices". Apple said it applauded the court "for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud clear message that stealing isn't right". Even after this latest trial, which will involve a new jury, both companies could appeal. "I think they will appeal unless they settle," intellectual property consultant Florian Mueller told the BBC. "But at this point neither party has enough leverage to force someone into settling if they don't want to. And we're not there yet," he said. Apple has asked for a sales ban to be imposed on the Samsung products that had been found to infringe the patents. But the judge ruled that Apple could adequately be compensated financially. "Between these types of big players a $1bn damages award is not as bad as a sales ban," said Mr Mueller. Apple appealed against that ruling and the result of the appeal is due before the end of the year. Samsung and Apple are currently locked in a battle in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe. But some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC recently that: "There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further. "I do kind of wish they were more compatible." In October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court in Europe over alleged infringements of certain types of patents for a period of five years. The European Union authorities had said the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faced a potential £11.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws. </body>

      <body>Asian shares closed higher on Tuesday led by Japan's Nikkei index, which ended up 2.23% at a three-week high. Exporters were helped by a softer yen, as the dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese currency. In Shanghai, shares rose 0.5% and South Korean shares rose 0.9%. But the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose by just 0.1%. Overnight, US stocks had edged up, lifting the benchmark Dow Jones to another record closing high. The dollar moved as high as 99.59 yen, its highest since 20 September, lifting exporters like Sony and Advantest, which climbed 3.6% and 3.2%. The Nikkei 225 index gained 318.84 points to 14,588.68, Meanwhile, Japan's broader Topix index rose by 1.67%, or 19.76 points, to 1,205.41. The positive Asian news came after a three-day run of losses on local stock markets. "The recent decline opened up room for bargain-hunting, but thin trading volume underscores investors' search for clues on the timeline for the Fed's stimulus cutback," said Lim Dong-rak, an analyst at Hanyang Securities in Seoul. </body>

      <title>News Corp reports fall in revenues</title>
      <description>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has reported a modest profit for the three months to the end of September, but also saw falling revenues from advertising.</description>

      <body>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has reported a modest profit for the three months to the end of September, but also saw falling revenues from advertising. The publisher of the Times and the Wall Street Journal said net income for the quarter was $27m (£16.9m). But revenues came in at $2.07bn - lower than analysts expected, resulting from a decline in newspaper advertising. The results are the first since News Corp was split into two separate companies earlier this year. The publishing business is now separate from the much more profitable entertainment business, which includes a film studio and television channels under the name 21st Century Fox. Last week that business reported a quarterly profit of $1.3bn. Mr Murdoch remains in control of both businesses despite the split. News Corp includes book publisher HarperCollins alongside newspaper titles that include the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post in the US and the Times and the Sun in the UK. Commenting on the results, News Corp's chief executive Robert Thompson was keen to stress that newspaper titles were in the middle of transforming themselves into digital content providers. "Our first quarter... was the beginning of a journey in the digital development of the company," he said. "We have been consistently cost-conscious and are transforming our publishing operations longer-term into multi-platform businesses. News Corp's newspapers in Australia, where Mr Murdoch was born, accounted for much of the firm's fall in revenue, posting a 22% decline in sales. The firm's papers in Australia include the Daily Telegraph, The Australian and the Herald Sun. Analysts said the weakness in the firm's Australian newspaper segment was well known but that the fall in income was worse than expected. </body>

      <body>High Street shoe chain Barratts and DVD rental chain Blockbusters have both gone into administration, putting more than 3,000 UK and Irish jobs at risk. Duff and Phelps has been appointed as administrator to Barratts. It said it was reviewing the shoe chain's financial position, as well as seeking a sale of the business. Restructuring firm Moorfields Corporate Recovery has been appointed administrator of TS Operations, which trades as Blockbuster. It is the third time in four years that Barratts has gone into administration. Philip Duffy, Duff and Phelps partner, blamed "difficult trading conditions" for its most recent failure. He said an investor had recently offered to inject £5m into the shoe chain, but withdrew this offer on 7 November. "In view of the financial position of the company and withdrawal of that equity offer the directors were left with no choice but to appoint administrators," said Mr Duffy. Barratts has 75 stores and 23 concessions across the UK and Ireland employing 1,035 people in total. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, said he expected Barratts to survive "in one form or another". "I would be surprised if it disappeared from the High Street altogether. It has a sizeable estate. I expect it to emerge as a much smaller business with fewer stores," he added. At Blockbuster, there were also suggestions that the DVD and computer game rental chain could survive. Moorfields said there were parties that were interested in parts of the business. "Our focus will be to secure a future for as much of the business as possible as well as trying to save jobs before Christmas," said Simon Thomas, joint administrator at Moorfields. Mr Thomas said Blockbuster, which employs 2,000 people across 264 stores, would continue to trade in the meantime. Last month, private equity firm Gordon Brothers Europe, which bought Blockbuster for an undisclosed sum in March, said it was filing a notice of intention to appoint an administrator to the retailer. </body>

      <body>Shares in BSkyB have plunged 10.9% after it lost the rights to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches to rival BT Sport. Shares in ITV, which currently splits the rights with Sky, also fell, closing 1.6% lower. BT's shares rose 0.5%. BT Sport has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015 after talks with European governing body Uefa. It paid £897m for the exclusive three-year deal. BT said the deal would make European football "far more accessible and affordable for fans". It said it would show a selection of the games for free on BT Sport even to homes that have not signed up to the channels. The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement. Both ITV and BSkyB suggested that BT had overpaid for the rights. "We were not prepared to pay over the odds in the latest live rights round," ITV said in a statement. Sky said that it bid "with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us". "It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more," it added. When asked on Saturday if it had overpaid for the rights, BT Consumer chief executive John Petter said: "Of course I don't feel that. "These were the crown jewels properties for Sky. I'm sure they'll be kicking themselves today. I feel for them obviously, but they got it wrong." BT said its financial outlook was unchanged despite the extra payments. And BT, which only launched its UK sports channels on 1 August, said the rights would improve revenue and profit in its consumer division in the "medium term". Investec media analyst Steve Liechti said the deal was a "hugely important showcase for BT's long term intent and the competitive threat to Sky". </body>

      <title>PM to lead trade delegation to China</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a trade delegation to China next month, he tells an audience in the City of London.</description>

      <body>David Cameron is to lead a delegation of ministers and business figures to China next month, he has announced. The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. "I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples," he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's "vast and varied markets" he said, adding: "This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come." Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the "global economy" was not a "zero sum game". "As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?' I believe we need to say a very firm 'No',". </body>

      <body>A second company controlled by the Brazilian former billionaire Eike Batista has filed for bankruptcy protection. Shipbuilding firm OSX Brasil made the filing in a Rio de Janeiro court less than two weeks after its sister oil company, OGX, also declared bankruptcy. Mr Batista is one of Brazil's best known businessmen, and once boasted a fortune estimated at $30bn (£18.8bn). But investors have recently lost confidence in his vast business empire. The group of businesses, collectively known as EBX, cover energy, mining and logistics. Shipbuilder OSX is estimated to have debts of about $2.3bn. Last month its sister company OGX sought protection from creditors with debts of $4.8bn - the largest bankruptcy filing in Latin America. Under Brazilian law, OSX will now have 60 says to come up with a debt restructuring plan. But even if a plan is agreed, the bankruptcies mark a remarkable downfall for Mr Batista, who was once ranked as the seventh richest man in the world. His problems began last year, when OGX announced that its oil production would be a quarter of its initial forecast, resulting a huge decline in its share price. Analysts say the company secured large loans, promising payment through oil that it had not yet begun pumping. </body>

      <body>Flybe, the Exeter-based airline, has announced plans to cut 500 jobs across the business, despite reporting a return to profit. Pre-tax profits were £13.8m for the six months to 30 September, compared with a loss of £1.6m a year earlier. The company said its turnaround plan was on track to make £40m of savings this year and £45m in 2014-15. But the pilot's union, Balpa, said it was "shocked" by the decision to cut jobs. Flybe employs 2,700 staff. Flybe has been carrying out cost-cutting measures, but chief executive Saad Hammad, who joined the company in August, said more were now needed. "It was clear to me that the existing Phase 1 and 2 cost savings were necessary but we simply needed to do more and to do it immediately," he said in a statement. Mr Hammad told the BBC he could not say where the latest job losses would fall at this stage. "We're consulting with unions and our staff," he said. Flybe cut 490 jobs in 2012-13, with a further 100 going in the first half of 2013-14. As part of the cost-cutting programme some routes could "possibly" go, Mr Hammad said. "These are challenging times," he added. Group revenues rose to £351.1m in the six months, up from £340.8m in the same period last year. The carrier now has 96 aircraft in its fleet, with 28 belonging to Flybe Finland, its joint venture with Finnish Air. Passenger numbers increased 5.6% to 4.3 million in the first half of the year. Investors welcomed Flybe's decision to carry out additional cost cuts, sending its shares up by 40.5% to 95.75p. </body>

      <title>31% pay 'unaffordable' housing costs</title>
      <description>Thirty one per cent of people paying a mortgage or rent spend more than a third of their disposable income each month doing so, a survey for BBC Panorama suggests.</description>

      <body>Thirty one per cent of people paying a mortgage or rent spend more than a third of their disposable income each month doing so, a survey for BBC Panorama suggests. Housing charity Shelter said that makes mortgage or rent costs "unaffordable". It said family budgets are being put under "enormous pressure" because of a "shortage of affordable homes". The survey of 1,003 people also suggests 46% of people think property prices are too high in their area. According to Shelter and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, spending more than a third of your disposable income on rent or a mortgage means you may not be able to afford other basic needs. 'Impossible choices' Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb said: "The widely accepted test of affordability is that housing costs should take up no more than a third of your income." "But in reality, many families don't have any option but to pay out much more," he said. "This sees some faced with impossible choices every day - including between putting enough food on the table or paying for the roof over their head." Among those affected by rising property prices is Abi Reilly, a 33-year-old special needs school teacher. She lives in a terraced house in Reading with her husband, Chris, and two children, five-year-old Daniel and four-month-old Elsie. They spend around 40% of their disposable income on rent. Having rented 13 different properties over the past 10 years, Mrs Reilly said homeownership does not feel realistic. "It feels too far away," she said. "How can we save for a deposit when our rents are going up, energy's going up, everything's going up, wages stay the same, house prices go up? Mathematically it doesn't work." The Ipsos MORI survey commissioned by Panorama questioned a total of 1,003 adults - of whom 697 pay a mortgage or renting a property. Mrs Reilly would belong to the 31% of people in this latter group who pay more than a third of their disposable income on their mortgage or rent. The survey also suggested that 46% of people think property prices are too high in their area and 39% would like to see property prices fall. In August, the Office for National Statistics said the average price of a property had reached a record high of £247,000. ONS figures also show that home ownership peaked at 69% of households 12 years ago. Since then it has been falling and is now at 64%. Panorama has also looked at the Help to Buy scheme set up by the government in April to assist people who could afford mortgage repayments but were struggling to raise a deposit. It allows buyers of new-build homes to put down a 5% deposit and take out a government loan for up to 20% of the value of the property. Help to Buy was extended to existing homes in October, under which the government partially guarantees mortgages. Since it began, there has been a 6% rise in the number of new homes being built. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek magazine, said Help to Buy risks inflating prices and overheating the housing market. "It's like pouring petrol over the car and setting fire to the whole thing," she said. "You know you might get a little heat in the short-term but the end result is not actually what you wanted." But the government has dismissed concerns about a property price bubble. Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: "In Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, house prices have moved very little or in some cases have actually gone backwards." "And that's reflecting where wages are and what money people have actually got to spend. " He also told Panorama: "We've seen nothing yet to suggest there is anything, going anywhere near a bubble at this moment in time."

      <title>Call for new offshore regulator</title>

      <body>Improving the way the UK's offshore oil and gas industry is regulated could boost the economy by £200bn over the next 20 years, a report has said. Retired oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood was asked by the UK government in June to carry out a review of the industry. His interim report made a series of recommendations aimed at maximising the economic benefit from the UK's remaining offshore resources. These included setting up a new regulator to oversee the industry. The current regulator, which is situated within the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), is now "significantly under resourced and far too thinly spread" to effectively manage the increasingly complex business and operating environment, Sir Ian said. He pointed to the rapid fall in production efficiency as an indication of poor asset stewardship by the industry, which the regulator had not been able to adequately confront. Sir Ian called on the DECC to establish a new arm's length regulatory body to take on the stewardship role for the next phase of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). This would be appropriately resourced and equipped with additional powers to achieve greater co-ordination of activities and collaboration, closer in style and influence to neighbouring North Sea regulators. It would work closely with industry to develop and implement key strategies in areas such as exploration, third party access to infrastructure, production efficiency and decommissioning. It would also have the right, for the first time, to attend operator consortia management meetings. The review recommended that the new body be funded by industry. Sir Ian interviewed 40 active companies in the oil and gas industry, representing more than 95% of UKCS production, while compiling the report. He also spoke to key government figures, and regulators from neighbouring regimes such as Norway and the Netherlands. He added: "The evidence is clear. We need to strengthen the capacity and capability of our stewardship regime to enhance collaboration significantly across the North Sea if we are to meet the challenging demands of maturity and diversity and maximise the economic benefits for both the country and the industry." His report said an increasingly diverse range of operators were currently investing at record levels in the UKCS. But it pointed out that exploration and production rates were falling, and activity was fragmenting into a patchwork of smaller fields. Sir Ian said operators were currently pursuing individual commercial objectives in isolation, which led to inefficiency across the industry as a whole He recommended that government and industry work together to pursue a new strategy, called Maximising Economic Recovery for the UK (MER UK). Industry would be required to sign up fully to the principles of the strategy and commit to collaboration in key areas such as the development of regional hubs and the sharing of infrastructure. It would also aim to reduce the complexity and delays in current legal and commercial processes which can hinder progress on important developments and efficiencies. Sir Ian said he believed that "full and rapid implementation" of the recommendations would deliver the equivalent of at least three or four billion more barrels of oil than would otherwise be recovered over the next 20 years. This would bring more than £200bn in additional value to the UK economy. However, the economic benefits could be even greater if the recommendations were fully embraced, he said. Sir Ian added: "I believe it is now time for a step change in North Sea stewardship and collaboration. We need to be prepared for the challenges of this next phase in the UKCS' life. "A better resourced arm's length regulator with a strong economic focus, capable of attracting top quality personnel with appropriate industry experience, will be able to work more closely with the industry and facilitate the development and progress we need. "This will require fundamental changes in operator behaviour but, as my interviews confirmed, they are clearly up for it". The equivalent of 41 billion barrels of oil have already been produced from the UKCS, with estimates of production still to come varying from 12 to 24 billion barrels. Sir Ian concluded: "It is essential for the UK's future growth and prosperity that we maximise recovery of our offshore oil and gas resource. "It is therefore crucial that industry and government act now to invest in this shared vision if they are to achieve these goals. "Subject to feedback, I will be urging DECC and government to implement the main recommendations on a fast track programme". The report was welcomed by industry body Oil and Gas UK, which called on the UK government to "move swiftly ahead with these proposals". Chief executive Malcolm Webb said: "The creation of a well-resourced arms-length regulator will, we believe, provide the single-minded focus required to deliver the maximum economic benefit for the industry and the country in this critical phase of the UKCS's life." UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the report had given "government and industry alike plenty to think about". He said he was looking forward to receiving Sir Ian's final report, and would set out plans to make the most of the UK's offshore oil and gas fields in the New Year. Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the Scottish government was "fully behind Sir Ian Wood's report". He added: "We believe it is essential that the recommendations are implemented with speed, and a shadow body be set up rather than await the outcome of primary legislation. "We share Sir Ian's view that the industry should finance this body, and since most of the developments in the North Sea and west of Shetland are managed from Aberdeen, Europe's Oil and Gas capital, we believe the only conceivable principal location for the new regulatory body is in Aberdeen." But Lang Banks, director of environmental group WWF Scotland, said: "There is something deeply worrying about publishing a report that aims to squeeze even more oil and gas out from beneath the North Sea just as delegates gather for UN talks to discuss ways to tackle climate change by reducing our dependency on fossil fuels." </body>

      <description>Shares in RSA Insurance plunge after the company suspends the chief executive of its Irish division.</description>

      <body>Shares in RSA Insurance Group have plunged after the company suspended Philip Smith, chief executive of RSA Ireland, and two other senior executives. RSA said they were suspended due to "issues in the Irish claims and finance functions". Group chief executive, Simon Lee, said the problems could reduce operating results by £70m in 2013. Shares in RSA, which owns the More Than brand, closed 11% lower. The problems were discovered after a routine audit, but RSA did not give details about what happened. "We are extremely disappointed with the issues which have been identified and their financial impact on the Group," he said in a statement. But he maintained that the problems were "isolated to the Irish business" and that "no policyholders have been affected." Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, said that while the accounting irregularities would be "extremely damaging for the group's reputation and credibility in Ireland", they would be "unlikely to topple the group." RSA has appointed accountancy firm PwC to investigate the financial and regulatory reporting processes and controls within the Irish business. This latest financial hit comes on top of last week's announcement that the company would have to increase reserves to cope with the increase in bodily injury claims. RSA is also facing a greater than expected number of claims following bad weather across the globe. It expects 2013's return on equity to be below 10% as a result. The St Jude storm, which ripped through the UK on 28 and 29 October, is likely to have cost insurers at least £130m in damage claims, the Association of British Insurers said last month. Four people died when the storm battered southern Britain. </body>

      <body>PepsiCo, the US food and drinks giant behind the Pepsi-Cola, Walkers Crisps and Tropicana brands, is to invest $5.5bn (£3.4bn) in India by 2020. The company said it planned to expand the range of products it sells in the country, and increase its manufacturing and distribution capability. India is one of PepsiCo's largest global markets. Chief executive Indra Nooyi said: "India is a country with huge potential." PepsiCo, which has net revenues of more than $65bn, said there would be "a particular focus on rural expansion", with investment in selling and delivery infrastructure and an expansion of its collaborative farming programme. The company, which also owns the Quaker and Frito-Lay brands, estimates that the investment will create more than 100,000 jobs, to add to the 200,000 it says it has already helped create since first investing in the country in 1990. Its Indian business currently generates about $159m in annual sales for the group. "We've built a highly successful business in India over the course of many years and we believe we've only scratched the surface of the long-term growth opportunities that exist for PepsiCo and our partners," said the Indian-born Ms Nooyi. The government has been trying to encourage foreign direct investment by opening up the country to competition, in the teeth of sometimes fierce public opposition. Marks and Spencer opened its largest Indian store in Mumbai on Monday, while Unilever has said it will increase its stake in Hindustan Unilever from 52% to as much as 75%. India's annual economic growth rate has slowed to about 5%, its lowest rate for 10 years. </body>

      <description>Taiwan's Pegatron Corporation reports lower-than-expected third quarter profits amid reports of slowing orders for iPhone 5C.</description>

      <body>Pegatron Corporation, the Taiwanese company that assembles Apple's iPhone 5C, has reported lower-than-expected profits. Analysts have said that Pegatron is experiencing slower orders for the 5C, which is Apple's cheaper smartphone. Net profits were T$2.48bn ($84m; £53m) for its third quarter, slightly below analyst forecasts, but higher than the T$1.35bn it made last year. Pegatron also makes laptops for Lenovo and former parent Asustek Computer. The company's share price hit an all-time high in May on reports that it was winning orders away from rival Hon Hai Precision Industry, another established Apple supplier. But in a recent research note Nomura said it was downgrading the stock from "buy" to "neutral" blaming "deteriorating orders for 5C and risks of new EMS [Electronics Manufacturing Services] makers taking market share". The bank added that it saw "a lack of positive catalysts in the near term". And last week the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was considering adding another Taiwan-based manufacturer, Wistron, to its roster of iPhone 5C makers, potentially increasing competition for Pegatron and reducing profit margins. In October, Apple reported falling fourth quarter profits of $7.5bn (£4.6bn), despite iPhone sales rising 26% to 33.8 million. These were the first earnings to include sales of Apple's new iPhone models: the iPhone 5s and the cheaper iPhone 5C, which is designed to appeal to the Chinese market. However Apple does not break out sales figures for the iPhone 5C. Over the summer Pegatron was criticised by human rights group China Labor Watch, which accused the company of workplace violations in three of its factories. The group said it found evidence of "at least 86 labour rights violations, including 36 legal violations and 50 ethical violations" following an undercover investigation. Apple is known to be diversifying its list of suppliers and looking increasingly to Chinese manufacturers. </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all 450 of its forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, of Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <title>'Strong start' for Help to Buy</title>
      <description>Royal Bank of Scotland and Halifax report a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme.</description>

      <body>Two major lenders have reported a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Halifax said they had received a total of 2,384 applications, potentially worth £365m in mortgages. The scheme is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages with deposits as low as 5%. But critics are concerned it could help to create a UK housing bubble. RBS and its subsidiary NatWest, and Halifax - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - are among the few lenders to offer mortgages under the government's extended scheme. HSBC and Barclays are planning to offer such mortgages in the future, but Nationwide, the UK's second largest lender, has not yet made a decision. The first phase of Help to Buy was launched in April, but only provided help to first-time buyers buying new-build homes. The extended scheme applies to all buyers and all types of homes, up to a value of £600,000. Under this part of the scheme, up to 15% of the value of the loan will be guaranteed by the Treasury. RBS said it had so-far approved 169 of its 1,075 applications, and five customers had already completed their purchases. It said the majority of applications had come from young couples with a joint salary of less than £50,000. The average price of the property being bought was £167,565. Unlike the first part of the Help to Buy Scheme, part two also offers help to existing home owners. However, Halifax said more than 80% of the applications it had received under the scheme were from first-time buyers, while RBS/NatWest said it was 73%. RBS said the majority of applications had come from outside London and the south-east of England, where property prices are rising fastest. It also said that five purchases had so far been completed. The government welcomed the figures, saying the scheme was supporting "responsible lending", helping borrowers who could afford mortgage repayments, but not a large deposit. "Four weeks in and its clear that Help to Buy is already delivering," said Prime Minister David Cameron. "Most Help to Buy applicants are first-time buyers, young and have a roughly average household income. This is all about helping hardworking people get on the first rung of the property ladder." But critics have expressed concern that the scheme could create a bubble in the housing market, making home affordability an even bigger problem. Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: "If the government was serious about helping first-time buyers they would also be bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes. "Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this government house building is at its lowest level since the 1920s," he said. Labour says that the Bank of England should review the scheme immediately, rather than waiting for a year. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest average house prices in the UK are at a record level. Other measures suggest house prices and housing transactions are well short of the pre-crisis peak. Figures from Halifax suggest house prices are well below what they were in 2007, but have risen steadily for the last nine consecutive months. The Nationwide Building Society says prices are currently 5.8% higher than a year ago. But estate agents argue that much of those price rises are seen in London and the south-east of England, while prices in other parts of the country are rising more slowly, or in some cases actually falling. The housebuilder Redrow reported that 35% of its sales since June have been under the first part of the government's Help to Buy scheme. </body>

      <title>Thames Water bill rise bid blocked</title>

      <body>Ofwat, the water regulator, has confirmed that it has turned down Thames Water's request to increase customer bills by up to 8% next year. Thames had asked to add an extra £29, or 8%, to the annual average household bill for 2014-15. But the regulator has ruled that it must stick to a 1.4%-above-inflation maximum rise, set in the latest price review. The company said it was reviewing the decision carefully. It has the option to appeal against the decision to the Competition Commission. Thames said it had faced extra costs of £291m, because various items had cost more than the amount estimated when the price regime was set. These included bad debts, the transfer of private sewers, land purchases and higher Environment Agency charges that could not be fully estimated at the time. Ofwat and Thames disagree about how much these items will cost the company. The regulator said in October that it was minded to turned down the requested extra price rise. It has now confirmed that decision. "We said we would challenge Thames' application, in the interests of customers. We did just that and on the evidence provided, we are not convinced that an extra bill increase is justified," said Ofwat's chief regulation officer, Sonia Brown. The current annual average household bill from Thames Water is £354. Responding to Ofwat's decision, the company said: "We will review the decision carefully before deciding on our next steps." Thames is the UK's largest water company, with 14 million customers. A week ago, Ofwat's chairman, Jonson Cox, wrote to the water companies asking them whether they needed to increase their bills for the full agreed amount next year, given the squeeze on household finances. In December, all water companies will submit their plans for the next price review, which will eventually determine how much they can charge from 2015 to 2020. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has written to companies calling on them to recognise people's financial strain and "look closely" at whether price rises were justified. Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for extra help for people struggling to pay their water bills. New social tariffs for the low-paid, which were introduced on a voluntary basis last year, should be made compulsory, he said. </body>

      <body>Barclays is to close four branches and move staff and banking services to nearby Asda stores. It said it then wanted to open another four branches in Asda supermarkets by early next year in an attempt to make banking more convenient. The initial four branches will swap locations to make parking easier, and sees branches with relatively low footfall being moved to the stores. Asda said that access to banking services was vital for communities. Bank staff will work at the new supermarket-based branches during normal bank opening hours, with cash and cheque machines accessible during the supermarkets' opening hours. The first branch will be opened in an Asda store at Birchwood in Cheshire in February. Three more will later be opened at Asda stores in Pudsey in West Yorkshire, North Watford in Hertfordshire and Broadstairs in East Kent. The additional four stores for new branches will be chosen later. Bank branches in supermarkets are common the US. </body>

      <body>The EU and US have begun a second round of negotiations towards creating the world's biggest free-trade deal. Talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had been set for October, but were postponed because of the US government shutdown. Relations have become strained after claims that the US listened to German leader Angela Merkel's mobile calls. US Secretary of State John Kerry last week urged European leaders not to allow the row to disrupt the talks. Together the US and EU account for about $30 trillion (£18.7tn) of annual output - almost half the world's total. The EU says a deal could bring annual benefits of 119bn euros ($159bn; £99bn) for its 28 member states. It is hoped that an agreement could be reached by the end of 2014. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that it would be "very good news for economic growth in years to come". Mr Schmieding said one area where agreed standards could help bring down costs was in the automotive trade, if the US and Europe could decide on agreed standards for cars. However, he says that potential stumbling blocks include the areas of personal data protection and GM foods. Others have said a deal could weaken existing strong consumer laws on both sides of the Atlantic. A third round of talks is scheduled for 16-20 December in Washington. This week's talks cover services, investment, energy and raw materials. EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and US counterpart Dan Mullaney will give an update on talks later this week. </body>

      <body>Stronger economic growth in the UK over the next few years will not be accompanied by a big rise in employment, a survey has suggested. A survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), a body for human resources professionals, found most employers were planning to take on new staff in the coming weeks. But it found less appetite for hiring over the medium term. Companies are looking to improve productivity instead, the CIPD said. Fewer than one in five firms are planning to significantly raise staffing levels should growth pick up. The UK economy is widely expected to strengthen over the coming months, after registering 0.8% growth in the third quarter of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics. But the rate of unemployment remains at 7.7%. "Our data on medium-term recruitment intentions suggest that stronger economic growth in the next few years will not be accompanied by big rises in employment," said Gerwyn Davies, labour market advisor at the CIPD. "Instead, many employers tell us they are focused on the need to raise productivity. The prospects of better economic conditions might therefore persuade them to invest more in the business and make more intensive use of existing staff, for example, by increasing working hours." The survey, which included more than 1,000 employers, found that the majority of employers were planning to increase staffing levels in the fourth quarter of this year. But just 17% were planning to increase their headcount by more than 2% over the medium term, even with a period of stable economic growth. </body>

      <title>China to boost Zimbabwe electricity</title>
      <description>China gives Zimbabwe a $319m (£199m) loan to ease electricity shortages by expanding its Kariba hydropower station, Zimbabwe's finance minister says.</description>

      <body>China has lent Zimbabwe $319m (£199m) to ease electricity shortages by expanding its Kariba hydropower station, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said. The project will take four years to complete and increase Kariba's capacity by 300 megawatts (MW), he said. Zimbabwe often faces power outages, affecting households and businesses. The deal highlights the "Look East" policy Zimbabwe adopted after falling out with Western powers. Mr Chinamasa signed the deal with the vice-president of the state-owned China Exim Bank, Zhu Hongjie. "This should go a long way in reducing power outages... For us the energy deficit has hamstrung the growth of our economy," Mr Chinamasa said. Zimbabwe produces about 1,200 MW of electricity but peak demand is 2,200 MW, Reuters news agency reports. The loan will attract annual interest of 2% and has a repayment period of 20 years, Mr Chinamasa said. China was a strong supporter of Zimbabwe's independence struggle against British colonial rule. The two countries strengthened ties after the European Union (EU) and US imposed sanctions on President Robert Mugabe and his inner-circle after Zimbabwe's 2002 elections. The Western powers said the sanctions were in response to human rights abuses and political violence under Mr Mugabe's rule. In March, the EU suspended sanctions against 81 officials and eight firms in Zimbabwe. The decision followed peaceful referendum on a new constitution which expands civil liberties in Zimbabwe organised by a coalition government. Sanctions are still in force against 10 people, including President Mugabe. He beat his rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, in elections in July. The elections went off peacefully but were marred by allegations of fraud. </body>

      <title>Entrepreneur who likes starting over</title>
      <description>Serial start-up entrepreneur Judy Estrin has been involved in the founding of eight businesses so far.</description>

      <body>The reasons that drive people to start businesses are many and varied. Some entrepreneurs are driven by a need to be the boss. They dream of creating a huge enterprise - with them at the top. Others see starting a company as simply a means to meet a particular need, and may find the business aspects boring and onerous. There's another set of company founders who not only love the challenge of solving problems, but also love the actual process of creating start-ups. The Californian serial entrepreneur Judy Estrin probably falls into the latter group. "I guess I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams," she says. Ms Estrin has been involved in the founding of eight businesses so far. She also has extensive experience of being at the top of some huge enterprises, through serving on the boards of companies such as Walt Disney, FedEx and Sun Microsystems. Ms Estrin says that, while she greatly enjoys and values her work with big companies, what excites her most is working in a smaller environment. "The best innovation happens when you have teams that are no bigger than a jazz band," she says. She says she did try to break her addiction to start-ups for a while - but what drew her back in was when her son got involved in launching a company. That business is Evntlive, a firm that streams live and on-demand concerts and events over the internet. The company has featured artists such as Bon Jovi, Moby, Wale and events such as the Mountain Jam festival. Pay-per-view costs typically range from around $3 to $11 (£2-£7), and vary depending on whether the concert is live or recorded. The enterprise seems to have entered a crowded marketplace, competing with many other streaming services from companies such as Netflix, and cable and satellite TV. However Ms Estrin believes that Evntlive can gain an edge over competitors by offering lots of extra features, such as additional content and integration with social media, allowing fans to communicate easily with each other during events. "We have what we call a 'buzz' feature, which is commenting and so everybody who's watching the concert can be commenting," she says. Ms Estrin studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and subsequently at Stanford University, where she worked with Vint Cerf, one of the pioneers of the internet. Despite having offers to work at several big firms, she joined a small new company called Zilog, because "a friend of my father's said that the smartest people he knew were at that company". Zilog was involved in making silicon chips. Ms Estrin says she found it both exciting and enlightening working at a technology start-up. Something she found particularly valuable was being included in the customer feedback loop, something that could happen only because the firm was still small. "In a big company, the engineers are very separated from the problems of the customer," she says. Bitten by the start-up bug, Ms Estrin left Zilog in order to launch companies of her own. Together with her then husband Bill Carrico, she founded Bridge Communications, which was an early pioneer of computer networking devices. She went on to launch a string of other businesses. One of these, Precept Software, was acquired by technology giant Cisco. Ms Estrin joined Cisco, and spent two years with the firm as chief technology officer. But not all of her ventures proved to be successful - one company eventually had to be closed down. Ms Estrin says it was an "awful" experience, not so much because of the notion of failing, but because "this group of people were going to not have jobs the next day". Nevertheless, she says that failure is "an inherent part of entrepreneurship". It's difficult to learn and improve if you don't take some risks. Something she points out in her book Closing the Innovation Gap, is that not enough attention to the different levels of success. "You can be a mid-level success and you can still be having a lot of fun solving a lot of good problems, making money for your investors. Not every company is a Google or a Facebook," she says. After taking some time out to work on her book, Ms Estrin found herself drawn back in to the start-up world by her son, David Carrico, when he and his co-founders were setting up Evntlive. Mr Carrico says he's heard "horror stories" about involving family members in businesses. But he felt he needed to do what was best for the company, "and I didn't know of a better entrepreneur in my network that I could enable to be a partner in this". Ms Estrin provided initial funding herself, and after acting as an adviser and mentor, she formally joined the team as chief executive. She says the worst thing about working with her son is: "He calls me Judy instead of Mom… everything else is great." </body>

      <title>Should women improve networking skills?</title>
      <description>Is it true that men are better at networking than women? Jane O'Brien speaks to a number of US business women to see how they network.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801975</url>
      <date>1383787901</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70951000/jpg/_70951345_golfnew.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>There is a widely held belief that women are generally better than men at developing and maintaining relationships. But many women seem unable to transfer those skills to the business world, where the same activity is commonly called "networking". "Part of the cause is that women value authenticity in relationships," says Deborah Gillis, chief operating officer for Catalyst, a women's business research and advocacy group. "Sometimes the notion of meeting someone and then looking to them for help, or advice, or contacts in business, often feels just a little uncomfortable. Men seem to do it much more naturally." Experts have various explanations as to why this might be, but they are agreed on one important point - informal networks are critical to success, and more women need to learn how to benefit from them. "Women need to think about networking as a business skill," says Ms Gillis. "And just as we would focus our attention on developing other skills that are important to our success, we should spend time and care in building our confidence and ability to network effectively." But becoming a part of informal groups - especially those dominated by men - can be difficult, as technology blogger and consultant Vanessa Fox discovered when she left Google to start her own company in Seattle. As one of the industry's few female experts on search engine optimisation, she had to overcome both professional and social barriers - and that meant learning how to play poker. "I would go to these poker games, and I was always the only woman there," she says. "It's not that the men exclude women - they actually invited me - it's that women either don't know about [these activities], or they're intimidated. "I think they have this idea that men can automatically play poker. But actually men can't play poker either, and a lot of women I know are really good at math - more so than the guys." But the game itself isn't as important as the conversations that naturally develop, she says. "They tell you what their start-up does and what they're doing, and so you get to know people. And because of my experience, a lot of these guys then want to meet up with me because they want my advice - and that's when you start to build relationships outside of the more formal events." Ms Fox is the first to point out that such an approach isn't for everybody, but adds that she had little choice. "I've had to join men's networks because that's what was out there," she says. "The tech start-up world happens to be mostly men, and it happens that they want to play poker. "They're not actively saying they're going to try to find a thing that women don't like - they just want to have a good time." Sport has also become a popular networking tool for women. "If you can speak sport, talk sport, in an authoritative way where you actually watch it, and follow the game and you're passionate about it, it allows you to be one of the gang and gets you into the circle you can't get into any other way," says Susan Spencer, a former manager at American football team Philadelphia Eagles. She says sport offers a "safe" subject for women to talk about with their male counterparts. Ms Spencer adds: "If you go out for drinks you don't want to talk about politics, that's a deadly one, you're not going to do boy talk with a load of sexual innuendoes because that takes you down a road you don't want to go - it has to be sport!" Jenn Harris has taken the idea a stage further with the launch last year of High-heel Golfer. Based in San Diego, she travels all over the country offering workshops to women who want to use the game to develop better business relationships. "I don't think of the golf course as a man's world. I think of it as a place to learn about someone else," she says. "All the little things that happen are ways to see who that person really is - how do they react after a shot, do they cheat, do they have integrity? You can't get that over drinks at a happy hour." A keen golfer since the age of seven, Ms Harris cites her own experience as proof of the power of golf. While working for a defence contractor she needed to get to know military commanders and other executives who all enjoyed playing. She joined them on the golf course, and attributes her subsequent success to the contacts she made. "I was promoted within nine months, was put on every big project over the next two years, and later, when budget cuts were made, the clients made it known that I shouldn't be fired - all because of that relationship I developed on the golf course," says Ms Harris. But employment expert Jean Martin says that unless women actually enjoy playing golf, the game is unlikely to be much use as a networking tool. "The number one element of a successful informal relationship is that the individuals are true to themselves. So doing something that you're not interested in just to be with people ultimately creates an artificial founding of the relationship," she says. Ms Martin is executive director of human resources at CEB, a global business advisory company with headquarters in Washington DC. She says research has demonstrated that effective networking can increase business performance by 30%. As a result, companies themselves are looking at ways to increase networking opportunities for women that highlights their different interests. "Rather than everyone trying to be the same, all on the golf course together, our data suggests that companies which have a lot of people with a lot of different interests and perspectives are significantly advantaged," she says. However, other studies still often show that professional women need to improve their networking skills. A 2011 report by the Toulouse School of Economics in France concluded that a major factor behind female directors earning 17% less than their male counterparts was the fact they were less good at building a network. The study found that in general the male directors had much larger networks of past acquaintances, while female directors instead focused on a few strong relationships. As she tries to build her own business, Jenn Harris attends five to six networking events every week - but says it's important not to make new contacts if you don't have time to follow them up. Vanessa Fox says she tries to be selective. "It is work for sure, and in my case there are some events that I know I'll hate and I just don't go," she says. "I try to find things that are a little more of a balance that I can enjoy and find valuable." </body>

      <title>The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked</title>
      <description>A profile of Sallie Krawcheck, who used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street, before she was very publicly sacked on two occasions.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24525479</url>
      <date>1383525175</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70553000/jpg/_70553183_sallie.109.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <body>Police are investigating whether former owner Craig Whyte is still involved at Rangers. When the Scottish FA transferred the liquidated company's membership to a new company "the key requirement" was the total lack of involvement of Whyte. Police Scotland are also examining documents filed with Companies House. Those documents lie at the heart of Whyte's claim he and former chief executive Charles Green colluded over Green's purchase of Rangers' assets. Former club chairman Malcolm Murray, now part of a group led by businessman Jim McColl seeking to be elected as a new Rangers board, quelled talk of Whyte's involvement. "I'm pretty sure he [Whyte] is not involved at all," Murray told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme on Monday. "I was given assurances, as the SFA were, that he wasn't. I said I wouldn't go any further if he was." Police have written to Green, who has called into question the documents filed in relation to Sevco 5088, to ask for his help in their enquiries. Green stood down from his position in April following Whyte's allegations, though an investigation funded by Rangers cleared Green of any wrongdoing. Police Scotland have been passed files by the law firm Pinsent Masons, who carried out the investigation that cleared Green. BBC Scotland has seen an email sent by police last month to a lawyer representing the former chief executive. Police Scotland will not comment on ongoing investigations. A source close to Green told BBC Scotland that he is co-operating with police, while a similarly placed source for Whyte says police have not contacted the former owner on the matter. The investigation is being carried out by Police Scotland's Economic Crime Unit. </body>

      <body>Derbyshire County Cricket Club is bidding for funding for a £3.65m redevelopment of its ground with a view to hosting a 2019 World Cup game. The club has secured £1.7m from the England and Wales Cricket Board to redevelop the County Ground. It is now looking for £1.9m in loan and grant funding from Europe, the government and local business groups. The redevelopment would include a new media centre and increase the ground's capacity from nearly 5,000 to 7,000. A club spokesman said landing a 2019 World Cup match was not crucial but the main aim of the proposal was to be eligible to be considered for international matches and improve facilities for players and spectators. The new ground could also host concerts and community events. The club had previously suggested it may have to move from its current home but, after talks with the city council, said redevelopment was the only possibility within the city of Derby. Chief executive Simon Storey said: "Now we have clarity on the council's position, it's clear that the only option available if we are stay in the city is to secure external funds to deliver the planned redevelopment of the County Ground. "We will, therefore, pursue the funding opportunities with the various bodies in the coming weeks and revisit our business plan projections and development plans accordingly." He added that the club had not completely ruled out a move to an alternative location elsewhere in the county. "We feel it's prudent for the club to continue with its evaluation of alternative options elsewhere in the county, as well as continuing our recently announced off-field operations review as we seek to reduce our on-going costs and balance our existing budgets in the short term," he said. Derbyshire were relegated from Division One of the LV County Championship in September. </body>

      <description>A group of disgruntled shareholders say they are troubled by the appointment of David Somers as Rangers chairman.</description>

      <body>A group of disgruntled Rangers shareholders say they are troubled by this week's appointment of David Somers as the Ibrox club's acting chairman. The group led by Scottish businessman Jim McColl says it does not know Somers or his role or plans at the club. And it has asked Rangers' stock exchange advisor to set up a meeting with the businessman. "Is he purely independent and there to ensure the AGM is conducted properly?" it asked of the delayed annual meeting. "Or is he endorsing the current dysfunctional regime and trying to rebuild it?" Rangers have been without a chairman since former team manager Walter Smith left the role in August. The appointment of chartered accountant and investment manager Somers as non-executive director and chairman came as it was announced that the PLC's annual meeting would be held on Thursday, 19 December. It had been postponed last month by a Court of Session ruling after former director Paul Murray led a legal bid to force a vote on the potential election of himself, former chairman Malcolm Murray and other McColl allies, Alex Wilson and Scott Murdoch, to the board of the PLC. Somers has already begun the process of interviewing potential replacements for former chief executive Craig Mather, who resigned last month and more board members could be added before the AGM. Now McColl's group has reiterated its desire to discover if former chief executive Charles Green is still involved with shareholders Blue Pitch Holdings and Margarita holdings, in addition to requesting answers about the club's "poor financial performance". The company reported a £14m operating loss for the 13 months to June. "We note the appointment of David Somers as acting chairman of Rangers International Football Club with bemusement," said a statement from McColl's group. "His gushing praise of the history of the club has been done by many characters in this revolving-door regime. "The fans are well aware of their history and instead need to hear answers to the questions they ask vocally at every game about investors' identity, Green's involvement and poor financial performance. "Last year's prospectus promised a high level of corporate governance. The result has been a disgrace. "Mr Somers says he stands for corporate governance. As none of us know Mr Somers, we have asked Daniel Stewart for an introductory meeting. "Our group is ready and fully equipped to rebuild the club financially and morally and, although we are being pressed by shareholders to call for a general meeting, we will wait in the interests of the dwindling cash balance. "We and they, however, will not stand for further appointments pre-AGM." Malcolm and Paul Murray will meet with representatives of Rangers fans' groups before Saturday's home game against Airdrieonians. </body>

      <body>In many countries getting a job has never been more difficult and with online applications and social networking to contend with, the world of job seeking has changed dramatically in just a short period of time. So you have to have the best possible resume, which can be on paper or even on your own personal website. You also have to be aware that everything that can be found about you online could be the thing that gets you the job or gifts it to one of your competitors. The task of pulling together all the information is not for the faint-hearted. Jobseekers soon realise that building a digital profile, while promoting themselves in social media, is a full time job, in itself. These days you're so much more than just your resume on paper," says Lisa Johnson Mandell, author of Career Comeback - Repackage Yourself to Get the Job You Want. She should know, at the age of 49, Johnson Mandell, lost her job when the website she worked for closed down. As a Los Angeles-based writer, broadcaster and film critic, she had years of experience - but whenever she applied for a new job, it went to someone else. After some soul-searching with her husband, she concluded her resume aged her and dwelled too much on the past. In many countries you don't have to include your age on your CV, because of age-discrimination laws. "I took off all the work experience that was 15 years or older because nothing was relevant after that," she says. She also removed the year of her college graduation and focused on her current skills. The resume became age anonymous and, in its new form, produced instant results. "I got responses to my resumes within 20 minutes of sending them out and I got job offers within two weeks," she says, adding she was stunned by the results. The writer now coaches jobseekers on how to give their resumes a makeover. "These days, people's attention spans are short," she says. "If you can't sell yourself and put the best stuff you've got in the first third of your resume, they're going to get bored and toss it. "Nobody has time to really dig into a resume and look at the details. "They want to know right at the beginning, 'What can you do for me?'" Michael Weiss, a Los Angeles-based marketing consultant, says the resume should complement a jobseeker's digital profile. This can include a personal website and a presence on networking services. The net affect should be to make an individual stand out from the crowd. "When you are looking for a job, when you're out there, the goal is, 'How do I differentiate myself?'" says Mr Weiss. But he adds that jobseekers should not feel the need to have a presence on every social media platform, because there are too many to choose from. "It's forced people to step back and think about the strategy of the story they want to tell," he says. "There are different stories that you are going to tell on Facebook, that you are going to tell on Twitter, that you are going to tell on Tumblr, that you can't tell on Instagram. It's different for all of them." Above all, Mr Weiss says, people must tell a constant story, and it is up to individuals to decide how they should present themselves. It may be acceptable to present a less corporate image on a personal Facebook page, while maintaining a professional profile on LinkedIn. "It all comes down to your personal brand," he says. "You really want to be accurate online, you don't want to embellish stories, you don't want to undersell them, you don't want to oversell them, you just want to be right on point. "The other thing you want to do, is you want to be authentic. You want to be real. You want to be who they expect you to be and I really want people to focus on being current. "Social media is 24/7, 365 and the door to your story is always open. If you have something posted from a month ago, you already look old." Mr Weiss also warns job-seekers - especially new graduates - that they should clean up their digital profile. Party photos posted on Facebook during their years at college may not be appropriate for someone trying to enter the corporate world. "I know it was a lot of fun, I know you had a great time, but you didn't have a filter on for four years or eight years or however long you've been on there." Mr Weiss adds: "I think there's a responsibility on yourself in applying a filter when you post content. "I think there's also a responsibility to yourself to know that there's stuff out there that you need to find, just in case." </body>

      <description>How biometrics make your voice the best weapon against fraud</description>

      <body>Big business wants your voice - not for customer feedback, but to tackle fraud. Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <title>Escape to Oz</title>
      <description>Young Europeans head to Australia in search of work</description>

      <body>Australia has become a haven for disillusioned young Europeans eager to plot an escape from economic troubles at home. Migration from countries such as Ireland is at levels not seen since the 1980s as Australia's seemingly bulletproof economy, insulated from the global slowdown by a roaring mining industry, offers the chance of a fresh beginning. But there are concerns that a flood of migrants in their early-to-mid-20s from Ireland and elsewhere on temporary working visas is squeezing young Australians out of the jobs market. "If we look at between 15-19-year-olds, we have 14.5% unemployment. Still well below many other places in the world but still significant enough to say that we aren't absorbing and giving skill opportunities to many young Australians, so the government has failed to get the balance right," says Tony Sheldon, from the Australian Transport Workers Union. "That means that labour has been brought in as an alternative, which is being more exploited, [has] less rights and [is] seen as a cheap form of labour but also an exploited form of labour." he says. He fears that foreigners could also be under-paid and mistreated by unscrupulous bosses. On a wild and blustery evening at Bondi Beach, Aoife Fahey and her friends frolic in the shallows after work. Ireland's chronic financial problems seem a world away as the surf crashes into Sydney's famous arc of sand, yet building a new life isn't easy. "[It's] a lot harder than people make out, 'Come over to Australia, there's loads of jobs, [it's] so easy.' It is not like that at all, no matter what you're working in. It's for lads a lot easier, but for girls it's hard," says Aoife, from Castlebar in County Mayo, who arrived in Australia six months ago and works in an Irish pub. Her friend, Michaela Kelly, from Drogheda, earns twice as much working in an office in Sydney than she did in Ireland. Like many Irish backpackers Michaela is well qualified with a degree in business. But with youth unemployment so stubbornly high in Australia, soaring up to 40% in parts of its major cities does she feel guilty that she could be taking a job from a local? "Is that bad if I say no?" she asks. "Irish workers come over here to work and they work hard because at home you are made to work hard, whereas Australians over here are just so laid back, they put things off and don't do it, basically. So, I don't feel bad." Most Irish backpackers arrive on one-year working holiday permits, which can be extended or upgraded to longer employment visas that can lead to residency and eventually citizenship although the process can take years. Australia owes an incalculable economic debt to successive waves of immigration over the decades, including legions of settlers from Ireland but academics now worry that a lack of training could increasingly leave young Australians unable to compete with temporary foreign workers especially in low or unskilled jobs. "It is important to think about where future immigrants are going and whether that competition could emerge," says Anna Boucher, from the University of Sydney. "I don't see it really coming out currently, but I see it potentially being a problem in the future. For instance, somewhere like the Northern Territory that has very high rates of indigenous youth unemployment but which is being signalled as an area for potential regional migration agreements in the future." Australia is grappling with chronic skills shortages in many sectors while seeking antidotes to worrying rates of jobless among its young. Meanwhile, this vast nation continues to invite those seeking work from afar to its shores. "You're watching [TV shows] Neighbours and Home And Away and you're just expecting everything to be perfect," says Denise Murtagh, who arrived in Sydney from Dublin with her best friend only a week ago. "But it is tough going because you're basically living out of a bag. You're moving from place to place every few days." "We haven't a clue what we are doing at the minute," adds Sinead Keane, who has come armed with a degree in business and sports management. "There's thousands of people in the same boat as us looking for jobs so I suppose you just have to talk to people and hope they help you out along the way." The Irish government says it's confident that parts of the diaspora in Sydney and beyond will succumb to the magnetic pull of home when the scars of the financial crisis eventually heal. But, for now, as the exodus of the young continues, Ireland's loss is Australia's gain. </body>

      <title>Champions League TV deal in focus</title>
      <description>BT shakes sports TV with its Champions League deal</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24895491</url>

      <body>The football and broadcast worlds are still digesting the impact of BT Sport's decision to pay close to £900m for the exclusive broadcast rights to Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season, for three years from 2015. The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, and could mean significantly more money for UK clubs in the two European competitions. But what does it mean for the sporting and business ambitions of BT Sport, as well as Sky and ITV, the current rights holders? Here Kevin McCullagh, deputy editor of industry publication TV Sports Markets, offers his opinion on where it has left the three broadcast players. "What this deal really does is provide another sign that BT really is a different proposition from Sky's previous and most recent competitors in the pay football market - Setanta and ESPN. "The size of this deal and the fact it is such an exclusive deal for such a major competition like the Champions League makes it far different from anything those others managed. "And the amount of money BT has put on the table is of a totally different order that what we have seen before. It shows BT has the financial resources, but also the stomach, for a battle with Sky. "They clearly see televised sport as a very expensive and long-term play. But have they paid too much? That is the huge question. "BT really needed to spend big money to get a toehold in a market dominated by Sky. "It is also worthwhile remembering BT launched its sports channels as a means of remaining a major triple-play player - that is, a provider of TV, internet and telephone services. "Before the launch of the sport channels, Sky was really making inroads and taking away BT broadband customers. The £900m is not only to add more sports TV subscribers, but to protect their broadband base, which is a much bigger business. "If BT is still the biggest triple player in 10 to 15 years, they will look back and see this period - and Champions League expenditure - as being worthwhile. "And by offering their sports products to their broadband subscribers, they are also positioning themselves as the choice for the budget-conscious fan. "They haven't announced their plans yet for the free-to-air games they will show. They don't have a free-to-air channel and I can't see them launching one. "So their options are: a) to un-encrypt their pay TV channels during these matches, or b) sub-license on to a free-to-air partner such as BBC or ITV. "The best thing for BT would be to keep everything on their channels. This allows them to put out the strong marketing message of BT being the only place to watch Champions League/Europa League football." "It is a massive blow for Sky. The importance of the Champions League should not be underestimated, nor what a major TV sports rights property it is in the UK. "It is probably the biggest sporting rights auction Sky has lost. "It is the second biggest subscriber driver after the Premier League, and Sky will feel the impact of this. "However, Sky has still has a top portfolio, and has got other major sports rights, as well as a broader offering than BT. "It has a really wide sports offering - including exclusivity to half of the Formula 1 races, England and Wales cricket, La Liga top flight Spanish football, and a major range of golf events. "This announcement has come as Sky is pouring money into other areas, for example original British drama. "By offering an increasing breadth of content, Sky is looking to give people other reasons to buy Sky subscriptions, rather than BT's. "Going back to sport, I don't think that there is anything very obvious that Sky can go out and buy right now to replace the Champions League rights. "I think they will look to weaken BT Sport when it comes to the next round of Premier League TV rights in England. "Sky currently has 118 live games a season compared with BT's 38 a season. "But where BT has done better than Setanta or ESPN is in the number of "first picks" broadcast choices - BT managed to win 18 games, whereas their predecessors got none. "I think Sky will be looking next time round to reduce BT's number of first picks." "This will have hit ITV too, as over the decades they have become the terrestrial television home of Champions League football. They have also been showing the Europa League on ITV4. "With BT grabbing the Champions League rights, it means that ITV loses its top televised football competition. although they do have live England internationals, which attract strong viewing figures. "But, having lost the FA Cup to the BBC, ITV now has no top-level live club football. "The upside is that the CL and EL were expensive and this has freed up a large chunk of budget that they can spend on other content. They will have roughly £50m a year available to spend that is currently going on Champions League football rights. "They may need to invest in midweek evening content for young men. "But, again as with Sky, there is not a lot of available football or other sports rights out there to replace the Champions League. "What has happened to ITV is being seen around the world, where the big global TV sports rights are all migrating to pay-TV. "It is the most compelling way to bring people on board as pay-subscribers. "I am talking about seasonal-long events, such as the Premier League or Champions League, where you have a series of games and can build interest and a following over a year (rather than a World Cup or Olympic Games). "As a result we are seeing a growth in value in top sporting TV rights." </body>

      <title>Women bankers break through in India</title>
      <description>How women are calling the shots at some of India's top banks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24867346</url>

      <body>Women have always worked in India, but the rise of the corporate woman in the last two decades in the banking sector has been phenomenal. India has no fewer than eight female banking bosses - indeed the appointment of Arundhati Bhattacharya as the first chairwoman of the country's largest bank, the State Bank of India, came days before the announcement of the new Federal Reserve nominee in the US, Janet Yellen. It's a stark contrast to places like the UK, where women run the British arm of international banks, but there are no overall female bosses. So how has India done it? And the reason for it is very simple, according to Chanda Kochhar, the chief executive of ICICI, the country's second largest bank - the company promoted on merit, not gender. "When you have an organisation that is gender neutral, and when you have a woman who is willing to give to her job whatever it takes, whether it's long hours, whether it's commitment to travel, irrespective of the fact that she's a woman, I think women get that opportunity to rise," she says. There were, of course, sacrifices. "What it required on my part was to really give to the job whatever it took. So yes, there were children at home, but if the job demands travel, hard work, long hours of work, I think you need to give it." ICICI is seen by many within the industry as a training ground for ambitious women. Typically, a third of its intake will be female, and the bank has made a point of nurturing talent and creating a whole crop of successful women. They include Shikha Sharma, chief executive of Axis Bank. "There's no substitute for meritocracy and there's no substitute for hard work," she says. "But there is the issue of women having the belief that they can make it, and everybody in society becoming sensitive to the fact that women can make it. "The presence of more women helps both those beliefs to happen, for women to have the belief, and for society to have the sensitivity to understand that yes, women bring a different level of contribution." Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management in south Mumbai trains those who will be the corporate bosses of the future, and counts Chanda Kochhar as a former student. Each year, the institute takes 125 young men and women, and competition to get in is fierce, with around 1,000 applications per place. Student Aditi Agarwal says she's very ambitious, but has had her own battles to get on. "I think women are just tired of being at home, they want to break out of those shackles," she says. "I can say this from experience - when I decided to study further for my chartered accountancy course, I didn't get a lot of support from my extended family. There was that mindset to have kids, make dinner for your husband - that's what's expected of you. "But I want to work, I want to make a contribution. I have a personal sense of identity." Fellow student Ekta Ambekar says there are lots of female role models now in banking, and she's sure she'll have the same chance to succeed as men. "Women are surely breaking the glass ceiling, and after all it's more about the talent that you have, and less about all the social constraints. It's always the talent and hard work that pays… your work speaks for itself." So why has banking distinguished itself when it comes to promoting women? According to Tarjani Vakil, who was India's first female banking chief executive in the 1990s, the sector expanded in the 1970s when banks were nationalised, and that coincided with increasing numbers of middle-class women entering the workplace. For her, it was lonely being the only woman at the top, but banking was always seen as a good job for women. "Women joined because it was a dream job for them," she says. "Banks were well organised. It was a safe place to work, because you didn't have to go to a factory, so the family didn't object. Women went to the office, sat in an air-conditioned office, and were very happy. "It was glamorous, and money is always glamour." She says at the outset the ceiling was concrete rather than glass, but that now it's been well and truly smashed. The structure of Indian society allows for issues like childcare to be less of a problem than in the West. The prevalence of extended families means that grandparents are around if a woman goes out to work, and all middle-class women have domestic help. Those women who have made it to the top will probably have had these advantages, as well as working hard for their success. India remains a largely conservative society, with traditional attitudes about the role of women in many regions. The country did a lot of soul-searching about its treatment of women after a brutal rape in the capital last year. But despite the major social challenges the country faces, the corporate world seems to have set its own progressive standards, particularly in the financial sector. Some think other industries will soon follow suit. P Vaidyanathan Iyer, the editor of the Mumbai edition of the Indian Express, says the educated middle-class now equals 250 million people - and it's the sheer size of that still growing white-collar workforce that bodes well for the future. "I'm sure in the next few years, or the next decade or so, you will have women doing very well in sectors like healthcare and information technology where we have a middle ground now of very successful and bright women in the middle-corporate levels. "These are areas where we have built a huge workforce of women, and it won't be surprising that you will find more chief executives." The problems of poverty and social inequality in wider Indian society persist. But in banking at least there has been a female corporate revolution - and this could be just the beginning. </body>

      <body>Two million bras sold in one hour, making a pile that would be three times higher than Mount Everest! That was the proud claim from Taobao, China's biggest online shopping platform, after its busiest day of the year got off to a strong start. November 11 is China's anti-Valentine's Day, a day when young people celebrate being single. But for many, it's also an excuse to log onto Taobao and other Chinese websites. Almost all products are sold at half price on major e-commerce websites. In just six minutes after midnight, $164 million was spent on Tmall.com, China's Amazon and eBay mixed into one. A few days ago, my roommate asked me what I had stashed in my online shopping cart for Singles' Day promotions on 11 November. She excitedly showed me what she had in stock: one pair of leather boots and a set of soft sheets. "Imagine buying these for half the original price," she said. Her shopping excitement quickly became dangerously contagious. I found myself watching for the clock to strike midnight on 11 November. A hiking jacket for my mum, winter boots for my dad; my family's shopping desires were all channelled towards me. It would be so easy to make these purchases, I thought, and how nice it would be to pamper my family with just one click on the "pay now" button, and the password for my credit card. But when the clock finally struck midnight, the payment page was hopelessly jammed. All I could see was a cartoon picture of a frantic cashier girl sweating in front of a crowd of shoppers. "Sorry we've got too many customers; please wait patiently," the caption said. Then the cartoon disappeared and I got an error page. It was a funny feeling; half disbelief that I wasn't able to spend money when I wanted to, and half lingering excitement and desire to spend more money. Just as I was watching some of the items became "unavailable" in my shopping cart, my roommate ran into my room. "Why isn't my purchase going through?" she yelled. I poised myself, and never felt so determined to spend my money. Luckily, the night ended in peace. We both got what we wanted, with a bit of agitation. I fell asleep hoping I wouldn't regret what I've bought, because honestly, I spent more time plotting how my payment would go through, than thinking about what I was buying. I'm not single, but I stumbled into the celebration of Singles' Day alongside hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The next morning, when I found out almost $2 billion was spent on Tmall.com overnight, I felt like a foot soldier who had gone to battle in someone else's war. </body>

      <description>How putting videos online made one 23-year-old a multimillionaire</description>

      <body>From a teenager on a council estate in west London to self-made multimillionaire, Jamal Edwards hasn't done too badly for himself in a very short space of time. Still just 23 years old, the amateur film-maker turned media boss is worth more than £8m, and counts famous entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson as one of his friends. Jamal is the owner of SBTV, a broadcasting company that makes videos - typically music videos featuring rap and pop music stars - and puts them up on YouTube. Attracting millions of hits, the business continues to make a fortune by taking a percentage of YouTube's advertising revenues for adverts that are linked to its videos. It is not a bad living for a young man who got into film-making after his parents gave him a basic video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15, and someone who by his own admission has no formal training. Jamal says it is just a question of believing in yourself, and finding your talent, which for him is making videos. "Try anything, don't be scared of failure, that is my advice," he says. "The only failure is not trying. And when you find your niche, what you are really good at, hit it so hard." Back when Jamal was 15, he says he and his video camera immediately became inseparable, and he started to film friends rapping or singing. Not instantly aware of the commercial potential of what he was doing, Jamal says he started to upload the videos to YouTube simply to make it easier for his extended friends to see them. "You can say my videos had mixed reviews to begin with, some people didn't get them, but others thought they were sick [good]," he says. "So I started to put them up on YouTube so everyone could see them, and it just grew from there." Leaving school and getting a job in clothing company Topman, Jamal continued to make videos avidly in his spare time. Building up a reputation for the quality of his work, he would film up-and-coming rappers and singers, while also targeting more established stars outside nightclubs, hotels and dance music radio station Kiss 100. As word of mouth spread, his videos on YouTube, put up under the name SBTV (the SB stands for SmokeyBarz, Jamal's own rapping nickname) started to get hundreds of thousands of hits, predominantly from 13- to 30-year-olds. And so Jamal contacted YouTube to see if he was eligible for a share of advertising revenues. YouTube, owned by internet search engine giant, Google, turned him down three times, but Jamal persisted. YouTube ultimately agreed after he was able to prove that all the videos he was uploading were original content that he had made himself. "My first YouTube cheque was for a couple of hundred pounds. So I said, 'Look mum, I have earned money from YouTube.' "But my parents were like, 'That's not sustainable income, that's not steady.' But the cheques have just got bigger and bigger. The more effort I put in, the more views the videos get, and the more advertising revenues I get back." Soon Jamal was able to quit Topman and run SBTV on a full-time basis. Today he has 12 members of staff, and SBTV also has its own website that carries news stories and feature articles in addition to the videos. The business has further branched out into its own clothing line, as Jamal says he is always thinking of ways to expand. And while the grime dance music scene remains a core focus, SBTV has also moved into other musical genres. An SBTV video of singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has had 7.7 million hits on YouTube. Jamal says he is now set on conquering the US, and further expanding the video content to cover comedy, sport and fashion. Regarding his interest in the latter, he was seen in the front row at September's London Fashion Week. Jamal has also this year published a self-help e-book called Self Belief: The Vision. The business so impressed Sir Richard Branson that last year Jamal won a best new start-up award from Virgin Media. And the two have stayed in touch ever since. Others who have seen SBTV's potential include technology and music investment specialists Miroma Ventures, which last month bought a share in the business for an undisclosed sum. Jamal was also chosen to become an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, the youth charity run by Prince Charles which supports young people setting up their own companies. After such meteoric growth, Jamal says he often has to remind himself to slow down. "I still get bad anxiety at times, if I have too many things going on. I have to sit down and tell myself to take a breather," he says. "I think this is one of the most important things for any entrepreneur to remember - that you can't go 100% all of the time. "I have crashed and burned about three times over the years because I was just working, working, working. Now I'm more planned, more organised." But has becoming a multimillionaire changed him? "Honestly no, I come from a humble background, I'm from a council estate. It is nice to be comfortable, and be able to buy things for friends and family, but I'm not motivated by the money. "I don't want to be treated any different, I'm still the same person, I'm well grounded. And if I wasn't, my friends and family would soon knock me down to size." </body>

      <body>There's something impressive about the engineer's mind - it focuses on identifying a challenge, finding a practical solution, and telling it to you straight. That's particularly true of the oil and gas industry. And that's the approach behind the report published on Monday by Sir Ian Wood, pre-eminent figure of Aberdeen's oil years. His analysis of the industry's failures, shortcomings and short-termism is blistering. He isn't much kinder to the civil servants who have regulated the industry for more than 40 years. And his recommendations represent a major shift of power from both of them - creating a new, arm's-length regulator, with big sticks more than carrots, to name and shame poor performers, and ultimately to force a sale of assets. This analysis spells out the end to an assumption that the UK public interest was aligned with that of the private oil companies. Until now, the policy has been: hand out licences, they drill, they pump, they make profits, they're taxed, and everyone wins. Not any more. This report reflects a new reality - that the interests of private companies may no longer be aligned with the public interest. So on behalf of the public, it argues the government needs to step in. Sir Ian was asked by Whitehall's Department of Energy and Climate Change, in response to an alarming and unexpected 38% fall in production over only three years. The UK government is particularly alarmed that such a fall has cost it around £6bn in foregone tax take. On that tax point, it's worth noting that Sir Ian's terms of reference did not let him look into the impact on reduced investment and production that resulted from the Treasury's £2bn tax grab in the 2011 budget. This is only pointed out in an appendix, though it's added that the fiscal regime "featured heavily" in interviews with oil industry players. No surprise there. The industry was infuriated, and this report lists the efforts made by the Treasury and DECC to win back the industry with targeted tax breaks. The first of two strikingly blunt messages in Sir Ian's report is that the current regime for the UK's offshore oil and gas sector is simply "not adequate". What's gone wrong? The cost of producing the average barrel has risen five-fold in a decade. The number of fields has risen from 90 to 300, the average one producing far less than the monster production of the Brent and Forties heyday. And there's been a 50% rise in the number of operators, complicating things further. Operating assets are showing their age. And while technology is allowing for extraction from tight rock and high-pressure, high-temperature reserves, it comes at a cost which companies are reluctant to pay. "There are strong signs that under-investment (in those technologies) will have a significantly adverse effect on maximising economic recovery for the UK," writes Sir Ian. This reflects a much more complex offshore sector than the 1970s, when this regime was put in place. DECC is described as being "significantly under-resourced, and far too thinly spread to respond effectively to many of the demands of managing an increasingly complex business and operating environment". In other words, the department is out of its depth. The other strand of recommendations represents that power grab, both from commercial operators and from Whitehall civil servants. This is radical stuff. Companies are being told they will have a duty to act in the national interest of maximising recovery of oil and gas, even if that clashes with their perceived commercial interest. (Which nation's interest? I'll return to that.) The drop in production is seen is "unacceptable and illustrates the shortcomings of existing asset stewardship". So under the Wood plan, companies would be held to account by a much stronger and better resourced regulator, at arm's length from government. If they are deemed to be under-performing, they'd get a private warning, then a public one, and ultimately, the regulator should "encourage the sale and transfer of assets to a company more committed to maximising economic recovery". On the evidence shown, that would cover several of the companies currently operating in UK waters. Sir Ian says: "In many cases, it appears that companies have constrained asset investment and expenditure in a drive to deliver short-term returns." Where companies are in consortia for sharing pipelines and other assets: "The frequency of failure to agree between and within consortia on key issues, including access to infrastructure and development of field clusters is very damaging." For instance, west of Shetland, the new frontier that's vital to the future of the industry, has had lots of talk, but "little collaboration has yet been achieved in field and infrastructure development". That infrastructure - both maintaining old kit and investing in the new - is the "Achilles' heel" of the industry. So where joint ventures are failing to get on and invest, Sir Ian wants to put the regulator into the decision-making room with them, to knock heads together. Sir Ian Wood wants the industry to hand over data, without lengthy delays. It should also be able to publicise how well companies are doing in looking after the asset they've been handed under the block licence system. And while he's at it, he wants this regulator to apply its powers and rigour to the onshore potential for shale and fracking. What this points towards is an explicit recognition that the oil and gas producers no longer share (if they ever did) the interests of the UK in maximising output. Each investment decision is weighed up against alternative prospects in more attractive basins around the world. And as extraction costs per barrel soar, it gets harder to justify spending in UK waters. There's still a big appetite for investment. The UK offshore sector is seeing record investment this year. But that's expected to come down off its peak very soon, and surely won't last if costs continue to climb. So if you assume the UK has an economic interest in squeezing as much as possible out of its sub-sea reserves (and the environment lobby would stop me there to point out that it has no such interest), then it's going to have to be much tougher and perhaps more confrontational with the producers on whom UK plc depend. What, then, of Scotland plc, and the nationalist case for taking over control of these reserves? I could find no mention of the independence debate in Sir Ian Wood's paper, just as I have heard little critique from nationalists of the way the Whitehall licensing regime has operated (as opposed to the tax regime). But all the same issues would apply to an independent Scotland. It could be an opportunity to set up more robust regulation, if Whitehall flunks Sir Ian's test. But ask yourself this question: would Scotland be in a better negotiating position to make demands of the offshore producers, or would they need them even more than Whitehall continues to do? </body>

      <title>Race to save typhoon survivors</title>
      <description>US and British warships head to the Philippines amid large-scale devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan, as survivors wait for aid to arrive.</description>

      <body>US and British vessels were heading to the Philippines as the UN appealed for aid amid the large-scale devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan. The US has deployed an aircraft carrier and navy ships, while the UK is sending a naval destroyer. At least 10,000 people are feared to have been killed and thousands of survivors desperately require aid - but reports say little is getting through. Philippine President Benigno Aquino has declared a state of national calamity. In a statement, he said the two worst affected provinces, Leyte and Samar, had suffered massive destruction and loss of life. A huge international relief effort is under way, but rescue workers have struggled to reach areas cut off since the storm. Bernard Kerblat, who is overseeing the UNHCR response to the crisis, said some aircraft had landed in Cebu but distributing aid was difficult because of bad weather and damage to infrastructure. "The rain is further complicating the effort for light vehicles, including trucks, to penetrate in areas wherever there's still a bridge left intact. "The other bad news is that within the next 72 hours, we should see the arrival of yet another typhoon." The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said 1,774 people had been reported dead, 2,487 were reported injured and 82 were missing. The death toll is expected to rise significantly in coming days. More than 580,000 people had been displaced and 41,000 houses had been damaged, the NDRRMC added. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon described images of the impact of the storm as "heartbreaking". The UN would launch a large-scale humanitarian plan, and allocate $25m (£15.5m) "to fund critical relief efforts", he said. "Many thousands of people are reported to have died and almost 10 million people have been affected... Let us all show our solidarity with the people of the Philippines at this time of need," he added. On Tuesday, heavy thunderstorms struck Tacloban, one of the areas worst-hit by the typhoon. Correspondents say driving rain has added to the misery of tens of thousands of people living amid the wreckage of their homes. One of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall, Haiyan - named "Yolanda" by Philippine authorities - struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Air Force Capt Antonio Tamayo told AP news agency the scene in Tacloban, one of the worst-hit areas, was "overwhelming". "We need more medicine. We cannot give anti-tetanus vaccine shots because we have none.'' Officials said looting was widespread and order was proving difficult to enforce. Correspondents say many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. The government says it has deployed armoured vehicles to Tacloban to deter looters. "We are circulating [the vehicles] in the city to show the people, especially those with bad intentions, that the authorities have returned," Interior Secretary Mar Roxas told DZMM radio. In a statement, the US said that aircraft carrier USS George Washington and other navy ships should arrive in the Philippines "within 48-72 hours". "As needed, these ships and aircraft will be able to provide humanitarian assistance, supplies, and medical care in support of the ongoing efforts led by the government and military of the Republic of the Philippines," the statement said. UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Darling would soon head to the disaster zone from Singapore. It would take five days to arrive but once in the Philippines would bring engineering and first aid expertise, as well as the use of a Lynx helicopter. Other countries have also pledged millions of dollars in assistance. Japan is providing $10m and Australia $9m in humanitarian aid, while New Zealand has pledged over $1m. Reports from Tacloban say soldiers have been distributing food and water to some residents and the US military has sent marines to the city. UN humanitarian official John Ging said: "Many places are strewn with dead bodies". "The first priority of response teams, once they were able to navigate their way into these areas, is to mobilise the burial of dead bodies because of the public health issues," he said. "As we get more and more access we find the tragedy of more and more people killed in this typhoon," he added. More than nine million people have been affected in the Philippines. Many are now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. On Tuesday, further details emerged of the extent of damage caused by the storm: Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the typhoon arrived, but many evacuation centres - schools, churches and government buildings - proved unable to withstand the winds and storm surges. Haiyan brought sustained winds of 235km/h (147mph), with gusts of 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves as high as 15m (45ft). In some places, as much as 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain fell. On Monday, the typhoon weakened into a tropical storm and reached Vietnam. State media said at least 13 people had died, although the fatalities appeared to have taken place during preparations for the storm, before it made landfall. The storm then moved into southern China, triggering rainstorms in Guangxi province, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The heavy rains have left one dead and affected nearly one million people in Guangxi, Xinhua added.

      <title>Deal with Iran was 'extremely close'</title>
      <description>The US Secretary of State says a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran is achievable, and they came "extremely close" to a breakthrough at the weekend.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has told the BBC that none of the differences between world powers and Iran over its nuclear programme are big enough to prevent agreement. He said they came "extremely close" to a deal at the weekend in Geneva. But he said the rest of the world had to be certain that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. Three days of negotiations ended without a breakthrough, but diplomats will meet again on 20 November. "We were very, very close actually, extremely close," Mr Kerry said. Speaking to the BBC's State Department correspondent Kim Ghattas, Mr Kerry reaffirmed that it would "take time to work through differences" between the US and Iran. "We haven't been speaking for 35 years," he said. "We just talked more in 30 hours than we have in those prior 30 years." Iran says that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, but world powers suspect it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Some reports said the latest talks failed because France had wanted to place tight restrictions on Iran's heavy-water plant being built in Arak. However, US diplomats have said the Iranian government's insistence on formal recognition of its "right" to enrich uranium had been the major obstacle. Mr Kerry said it was critical to be certain that Iran does not have a nuclear weapons programme, and that negotiations about enrichment were ongoing. "They have to see that there is a standard by which they might be able to do something - provided they meet certain standards in order to do it," he said. Iran backed out of a deal on the last day of talks, Mr Kerry added. "We had a unity on Saturday in a proposal put in front of the Iranians... but they felt they had to go back." Representatives from Iran and the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, Russia and China plus Germany - will meet again in Geneva later this month to resume discussions. Meanwhile Iran has reached an agreement with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), over its nuclear programme. The deal opens the way for UN inspectors to gain better access to two key nuclear sites in Iran. Experts say progress between Iran and the IAEA is a vital parallel track to the talks between Iran and the major powers. </body>

      <title>Egypt 'worst in Arab women's rights'</title>
      <description>Egypt is now the worst country for women's rights in the Arab world, according to a poll of experts on gender issues in 22 Arab states.</description>

      <body>Egypt is now the worst country for women's rights in the Arab world, according to a poll of gender experts. The study found sexual harassment, high rates of female genital mutilation and a growth in conservative Islamist groups contributed to the low ranking. The Comoros islands came top in the survey, which was conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The poll surveyed more than 330 gender experts in 21 Arab League states as well as Syria. It is the foundation's third annual study focusing on women's rights since the Arab Uprisings in 2011. Iraq ranked second-worst after Egypt, followed by Saudi Arabia, Syria and Yemen. The Comoros, where women hold 20% of ministerial positions, is followed at the top of the rankings by Oman, Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar. The poll asked experts to assess factors such as violence against women, reproductive rights, treatment of women within the family and women's role in politics and the economy. Discriminatory laws and a spike in trafficking contributed to Egypt's place at the bottom of the ranking of 22 Arab states, the survey said. "There are whole villages on the outskirts of Cairo and elsewhere where the bulk of economic activity is based on trafficking in women and forced marriages," said Zahra Radwan of US-based rights group Global Fund for Women. However, sexual harassment was cited as the main factor. A UN report in April said 99.3% of women and girls in Egypt had been subjected to sexual harassment. "The social acceptability of everyday sexual harassment affects every woman in Egypt regardless of age, professional or socio-economic background, marriage status, dress or behaviour," said Noora Flinkman of Egyptian campaign group HarassMap. Meanwhile, the survey said Iraq was now more dangerous for women than under Saddam Hussein, with women disproportionately affected by the violence of the past decade. Saudi Arabia ranked poorly on women's involvement in politics, workplace discrimination, freedom of movement and property rights. But the conservative country scored better than many other Arab states when it came to access to education and healthcare, reproductive rights and gender violence. </body>

      <title>Thai Senate rejects amnesty bill</title>
      <description>Thailand's Senate rejects a controversial amnesty bill which could have led to the return of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</description>

      <body>Thailand's Senate has rejected a controversial amnesty bill that could have led to the return of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The amnesty would have applied to offences committed during the political turmoil after Thailand's 2006 coup, which ousted Mr Thaksin. The bill's passage in the lower house triggered large street protests. And on Monday, as the bill went to the Senate, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bangkok. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra - who is Mr Thaksin's sister - has promised to respect the Senate's decision. The bill, which was proposed by the governing Pheu Thai party, applied to offences committed during the upheaval after Mr Thaksin was removed from office. Ms Yingluck's government had argued that the legislation was a necessary step towards reconciliation, after several years of political turmoil. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics said it would allow human rights abuses - such as the killing of civilian protesters - to go unpunished. The main opposition Democrat Party also believed it was aimed at allowing Mr Thaksin to return to Thailand without having to serve a jail sentence. Mr Thaksin has been in self-imposed exile since his conviction on corruption charges over a property deal. He argues the charges are politically motivated. The lower house backed the bill, despite an opposition boycott. But as protests gathered strength, the governing party withdrew its support from the bill and all 141 senators present voted against it. "This house rejects this bill for consideration," said Deputy Senate Speaker Surachai Lengboonlertchai. As tens of thousands of anti-government protesters remained on the streets in parts of Bangkok on Monday night, a spokesperson for the Pheu Thai party said the governing coalition would not bring the amnesty bill back to parliament. "We believe from tomorrow the political crisis will start to ease as there are no reasons to maintain the protest," said Pormpong Nopparit. But the opposition has urged its supporters to observe a three-day national strike, beginning on Wednesday, in what correspondents say has turned into a campaign to bring down the government. Former leader Thaksin Shinawatra is a deeply polarising figure in Thai politics. He drew huge support from Thailand's rural poor but strong opposition from other sectors in society, and the divisions dating from the 2006 coup continue to dominate the political landscape. </body>

      <body>Israeli far-right politician Avigdor Lieberman has returned to the post of foreign minister after being cleared of corruption charges. Mr Lieberman was sworn in after parliament endorsed his return to government by 62 votes to 17. His party Yisrael Beytenu is part of the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr Lieberman, 55, is a critic of US-backed peace negotiations with the Palestinians, which resumed in July. He stepped down last December after he was charged with fraud and breach of trust. The accusations related to his alleged involvement in the promotion of Israel's former ambassador to Belarus. But a court in Jerusalem acquitted him last week. Mr Lieberman is a key ally of Mr Netanyahu and his party ran on a list with Likud which narrowly won general elections in January. The prime minister served as interim foreign minister after he resigned, keeping the post open. He said on Monday that he looked forward to Mr Lieberman's return to government. "We have a lot to work on; great tests and great challenges," he said. "Welcome back." Prosecutors had accused Mr Lieberman of intervening to promote Zeev Ben Aryeh, the former ambassador to Belarus, to a post in Latvia. They argued it was a reward for a tip-off about a separate criminal investigation he was facing. The judges ruled last Wednesday that Mr Lieberman had behaved inappropriately by not disclosing the information given to him by Mr Ben Aryeh, but it had not been a criminal offence. One of Israel's most outspoken politicians, Mr Lieberman was born in Moldova and was one of the million Israelis who emigrated from the former Soviet Union. To the right of Mr Netanyahu politically, he has been a staunch critic of the Palestinian Authority and its leader Mahmoud Abbas. </body>

      <body>Police say a man who shot dead three fellow Iranian-expat musicians in New York before taking his own life was upset about being kicked out of a band. Ali Akbar Mahammadi Rafie, 29, killed two members of the indie group Yellow Dogs and a third artist. A member of another group, from which Rafie had been thrown out, tried to disarm him during the attack in the borough of Brooklyn, said police. The Yellow Dogs' manager said the victims had fallen out with Rafie. The attack began early on Monday as the attacker, armed with a rifle, climbed down from the roof of the apartment building. He shot dead Ali Eskandarian, 35, a musician, through the window of a third-floor terrace, said police. Arash Farazmand, 28, the Yellow Dogs drummer, was shot dead on the same level of the flat. His brother, Soroush Farazmand, 27, the band's guitarist, was using his laptop in bed on the second floor when he received fatal gunshot injuries. The Farazmands had just received political asylum in the US. The Yellow Dogs' two other members were not at the flat at the time of the killing. According to police, another tenant was hit in the arm as Rafie and a former fellow band mate from a group called the Free Keys struggled over the gun. Rafie then retrieved ammunition that had fallen out of the firearm, went to the roof and shot himself in the head, said police. The person wounded in the arm was taken to hospital and is said to be in stable condition. Rafie "was upset that he wasn't in the band anymore", said New York Police Department spokesman John McCarthy. The rifle was found next to Rafie's body, according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. He said it had been purchased in New York state in 2006, and police were tracking its history. Police are also investigating whether a guitar case found near the scene was used to carry the weapon. The gunman and members of the Free Keys are said to have had an argument over money, though it was unclear why he attacked the Yellow Dogs bandsmen. Ali Salehezadeh, the Yellow Dogs' manager, said Rafie knew the victims but had not spoken to them in months because of a "petty conflict". "There was a decision not to be around each other," he said. "They were never that close to begin with. We thought it was all behind us." The Yellow Dogs describe themselves on their Twitter feed as "a Post Punk/Dance Punk band from Tehran/Iran, living in Brooklyn at the moment". The band is well-known among young Iranian expatriates in the US, reports Bahman Kalbasi of the BBC Persian service. The shooting took place in Brooklyn's East Williamsburg neighbourhood, known for community of artists and musicians. The band members had lived in the neighbourhood. "They seem like really nice guys," a local man, Martin Greenman, told the New York Daily News. "They didn't seem in any way to be violent guys. They weren't rabble rousers or anything like that." Members of an Iranian band with the same name were interviewed by US consulate officials in Istanbul in 2009 as they applied for a visa for a US tour, according to a diplomatic cable leaked to Wikileaks. They described the "small but crazy" underground rock scene in Tehran, saying it was the community that offered "the most free expression" in Iran. </body>

      <body>India's mission to Mars has overcome a technical problem and appears to be back on track, the country's space research agency says. The problem occurred on Monday when a planned engine burn failed to raise the spacecraft's orbit around Earth by the intended amount. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has now pushed the spacecraft to a higher velocity as planned. Isro officials said its final orbit "will be known in a few hours". The problem occurred during a manoeuvre designed to boost the craft's maximum distance from 71,623km to 100,000km. A problem with the liquid fuel thruster caused the 1,350kg vehicle to fall short of the mark. As a solution, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) - known informally as Mangalyaan, or Mars-craft - executed an additional thruster firing to make up for the shortfall early on Tuesday. Speaking to Pallava Bagla, science editor at Indian broadcasting network NDTV, Isro's chairman K Radhakrishnan said: "All is well and operations completed as planned. The final orbit of the spacecraft will be known in a few hours." Mr Bagla told BBC News that the "spacecraft has been put on required velocity and seems to be on track". Instead of flying directly to Mars, the $72m (£45m) probe is scheduled to orbit Earth until the end of the month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. </body>

      <body>Four earthquakes have shaken homes in the Indian capital, Delhi, sending people running into the streets. India's meteorological department said the first tremor measured magnitude 3.1 and was centred near a neighbourhood in south Delhi. This was followed by three more tremors measuring 3.3, 2.5 and 2.8 magnitude over an hour in the capital and its suburbs of Noida and Ghaziabad. No damage or casualties have been reported in Delhi or the suburbs. The first quake hit at 12:41 (18:30 GMT), India's meteorological department said. Reports say several people ran out of their homes after the tremors. "This must be the strongest earthquake tremor I have ever felt. It was like earth shivering," a Delhi resident with the Twitter handle @DilliDurAst tweeted. Others like S Irfan Habib tweeted that "despite being awake till 0100 never felt the earthquake shocks in Delhi. May be low intensity and central Delhi was away from its centre." Delhi is close to several fault lines and held a major earthquake drill last year. </body>

      <title>Apple and Samsung back in court</title>
      <description>Apple and Samsung are heading back to court in a row over damages awarded in a patent action.</description>

      <body>Apple and Samsung are returning to court in one of the most high-profile patent battles of recent times. In August 2012, a jury found Samsung guilty of infringing six Apple patents and awarded one of the largest payouts of its kind on record. The verdict and $1bn (£626m) awarded in damages were seen as a massive victory for Apple. This is just one of many patent cases the two companies are fighting in courtrooms across the world. In March 2013, a judge re-examined the $1bn awarded to Apple and reduced the amount saying the damages would need to be assessed at a new trial. Judge Lucy Koh said the original jury in the court in California had incorrectly calculated part of the damages. The judge said that $550m of the award had been worked out in the proper manner but she ordered that the remaining $450m be reassessed. That $450m could be increased or lowered meaning that Apple could conceivably end up with more than the original $1bn awarded at the first trial. Apple had originally sought $2.5bn in damages from Samsung. It argued that the South Korean company had copied its designs for the bodies of the original iPhone and iPad as well as user-interface elements such as the bounce-back response when a person scrolls beyond the end of list and tap-to-zoom. Samsung argued it was already working on rounded rectangular handsets dominated by a screen and a single button months before the iPhone was revealed. It sought $519m in damages from Apple. At the time of the original ruling Samsung said the decision was bad news for consumers and would "lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices". Apple said it applauded the court "for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud clear message that stealing isn't right". Even after this latest trial, which will involve a new jury, both companies could appeal. "I think they will appeal unless they settle," intellectual property consultant Florian Mueller told the BBC. "But at this point neither party has enough leverage to force someone into settling if they don't want to. And we're not there yet," he said. Apple has asked for a sales ban to be imposed on the Samsung products that had been found to infringe the patents. But the judge ruled that Apple could adequately be compensated financially. "Between these types of big players a $1bn damages award is not as bad as a sales ban," said Mr Mueller. Apple appealed against that ruling and the result of the appeal is due before the end of the year. Samsung and Apple are currently locked in a battle in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe. But some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC recently that: "There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further. "I do kind of wish they were more compatible." In October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court in Europe over alleged infringements of certain types of patents for a period of five years. The European Union authorities had said the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faced a potential £11.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws. </body>

      <title>Film gun violence 'has tripled'</title>
      <description>Levels of gun violence have more than tripled since 1985 in films rated as suitable for teenagers aged 13 and older, according to a US study.</description>

      <body>Levels of gun violence have more than tripled since 1985 in films rated as suitable for teenagers, according to a US study. Gun violence in PG-13 films last year actually exceeded that in films rated R for viewers aged 17 and older, according to the research. Overall film violence had doubled since 1950, found the study published in the American Academy of Pediatrics. Put simply, violence "sells", one researcher told the BBC. Dr Daniel Romer, co-author of Gun Violence Trends in Movies, said he and his colleagues had examined the top 30 grossing movies of each year from 2012 to 1950. In a total of 945 films from the last six decades, there were 17,695 violent scenes, according to the joint study by Ohio State University and the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Some 396 of the 420 films they studied since 1985 contained violence, including 783 instances of gun violence. Some of the recent PG-13 movies that "had a lot of gun violence", according to the study, included The Dark Knight (2008), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), The Amazing Spiderman (2012) and Taken 2 (2012). The study's authors suggested that sex scenes were more likely to incur a stricter rating than scenes of violence. Dr Romer suggested the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) re-evaluate its rating system in order to better protect young viewers in the future. "We'd like to see those films [containing gun violence] put into the R category… or [have them] rethink how much gun violence they will show," Dr Romer said. Viewership of R-rated films is restricted to those over age 17 or accompanied by a parent; PG-13 strongly cautions parents that some material may not be appropriate for viewers under age 13. But that rating does not preclude theatres from selling tickets to anyone of any age. </body>

      <title>Falkland farewell for 'Space Ferrari'</title>
      <description>The final moments of Europe's Goce satellite were caught on camera as it blazed across the sky above the South Atlantic.</description>

      <body>The final moments of the Goce satellite were caught on camera as it blazed across the sky above the South Atlantic. Falkland Islander Bill Chater managed to record the scene as he returned from a day's outing to see penguins. “We saw what we first thought was a shooting star,” Bill told me. “It soon became obvious it was the satellite we had heard about on BBC Radio News an hour before. “It left a long trail of smoke which was bright white in the dark sky, presumably lit by the Sun which we could no longer see.” Goce's fall to Earth on Sunday night made it the first European Space Agency (Esa) mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry into the atmosphere in more than 25 years. Esa has looked at the pictures acquired on East Falkland and says they represent - "in all likelihood" - the destructive end of its one-tonne probe. Dubbed the "Ferrari of space" because of its sleek Italian design, Goce had spent the past four years making precise maps of Earth's gravity. Its plunge through the atmosphere on Sunday became inevitable once the electric engine it had employed to stay in orbit ran out of fuel. Tracking systems were deployed to monitor the rapid descent, with a final estimate for the location of the re-entry put close to the tip of South America, just east of Tierra Del Fuego. American military data timed this event to have occurred at 00:16 GMT, or 21:16 local Falkland time - just as Bill, his wife Vicky, and dad, Tony Chater, were making their way home after spending the day with King Penguins. “We were returning home from Volunteer Point,” says Bill. “It was just getting dark following a long, spectacular sunset and as we came over Wall Mountain, heading south, we saw what we first thought was a shooting star. “It was leaving a thick white trail of smoke and split into a couple of bits, before again breaking up into several smaller parts which all flew over our heads and disappeared northwards over Wall Mountain behind us.” The description of the event fits, as does the location and timing. The direction of the fireballs – moving south to north – also matches what would have been Goce’s death trajectory. Bill says he has video of the event but cannot share it because of the islands’ slow internet connection. Goce started its descent from an operational altitude of 224km, and took a total of three weeks to fall to Earth. The thermal and mechanical stresses that ultimately tore the satellite apart would have begun to take hold while it was still 80km from the Earth's surface. Experts had suggested some 200-250kg could have survived all the way down. If they did, these twisted and charred materials are now at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. It was a violent end for one of the most delicate and sensitive space instruments ever built. Goce’s data lives on, however. Its exquisite maps of the subtle variations in gravity across the surface of the Earth will influence a diverse array of disciplines - from ocean and climate research to geology and civil engineering. </body>

      <body>An electrical current capable of charging a mobile phone has been created from microwave signals. A team from Duke University said the technology they had used had been as efficient as using solar panels. The device they created used metamaterials, which capture various forms of wave energy and convert them for other applications. In the future, satellite, sound or wi-fi signals could be "harvested", according to the US researchers. "We're showing... these materials can be useful for consumer applications," said engineering student Alexander Katko. Using fibreglass and copper conductors on a circuit board, the researchers converted microwaves into 7.3 volts of electricity. A USB charger, which is often used to recharge mobile phone batteries and cameras, provides about five volts. "We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve," said team member Allen Hawkes. "We had been getting energy efficiency around 6-10%, but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37%, which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells." Metamaterials are artificial materials that display properties not usually found in nature. In future, the two students and their colleague Steven Cummer hope that the technology can be built in to mobile phones. This would allow the handsets to recharge wirelessly when not being used. They also believe that it could help users living in remote areas without access to the power grid. They would be able to "harvest" the energy from signals generated by mobile phone towers. "Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting," said Mr Cummer. "The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power." The full report will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December. </body>

      <body>A black woman whose fatal shooting by a US homeowner has prompted claims of racial profiling was shot in the face, a post-mortem examination found. Renisha McBride, 19, received fatal injuries on the front porch of a home in Detroit, Michigan, this month. Her family says she was disoriented and looking for help after having just been involved in a car crash nearby. The homeowner said he had feared a burglary, but civil rights leaders are demanding justice. Prosecutors say they are reviewing whether to charge the unidentified 54-year-old, who told police he fired his shotgun accidentally. A lawyer for the man said he was "torn up" by McBride's death, but that he had feared for his life at the time. Michigan is one of several US states with a so-called stand your ground law, which allows the use of deadly force if a person feels their life is in danger, though it is unclear whether that will be argued in this case. A post-mortem examination report released on Monday confirmed that McBride had been shot in the face, but not at close-range. The Wayne County medical examiner's office report has ruled her death a homicide. She was shot as she stood on the porch in the predominantly-white Dearborn Heights area shortly before 04:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Saturday 2 November. The Detroit Free Press reported that a car registered to McBride's family had been involved in a collision with a parked vehicle just over two hours before the shooting, a few streets away. It is unclear what happened in the intervening time. McBride's relatives have called for a thorough investigation into the shooting. "It's hard to... believe it's an accident when a gun is in her face and the trigger is pulled," the family lawyer, Gerald Thurswell, told the Detroit News on Friday. The case has attracted the attention of civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Michigan congressman John Conyers. On Saturday, about 200 people showed up at a rally organised by Rev Sharpton's National Action Network. </body>

      <body>The son of an Oklahoma senator was killed in a plane crash outside a Tulsa airport at the weekend, according to the US defence secretary. Dr Perry Inhofe, 52, son of Republican Jim Inhofe, was a licensed pilot and the sole victim of Sunday's crash, local media reported. In a statement, Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel said he was "deeply saddened to learn" of Inhofe's death. Officials say they have not found a preliminary cause for the crash. Nor have they commented on the identity of the deceased. The elder Mr Inhofe, 79, underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery last month. Local media reported the death on Monday, citing sources close to the Oklahoma senator's family as well as the plane's registration documents. The senator's office has not released a statement about the crash. The Tulsa World reported that the aircraft had been bought by a firm owned by Dr Inhofe, an orthopaedic surgeon and keen aviator, in September. Tulsa International Airport received a request for immediate assistance at 15:45 local time (21:45 GMT), about 15 minutes before the crash, local broadcaster KOCO reported. The plane, a Mitsubishi twin turboprop, had taken off from an airport in the state of Kansas. It had been on approach to the Tulsa airport before the accident, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator said on Monday. One witness told the newspaper he saw the plane circle around nearby before it nosedived and burst into flames. "It was fully engulfed when we got there and it looked like the wings had come detached," Jake Bray told the World. "There were tires popping... There was nothing we could do." </body>

      <title>Venezuela 'to expand price controls'</title>
      <description>Following the government's seizure of electronic shops, the Venezuelan leader says he intends to broaden price controls to all consumer goods.</description>

      <body>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he plans to extend price controls to all consumer goods, if he is given powers to govern by decree. In a televised address, Mr Maduro said that he wanted to set legal limits on businesses' profit margins. His announcement followed the seizure on Saturday of shops accused of selling electronic goods at inflated prices. The National Assembly is expected to vote this week on his request to govern temporarily by decree. The president demanded there be "zero tolerance with speculators" in his speech broadcast on Sunday. "This is beyond usury, this is theft," he added. On the weekend, soldiers occupied a chain of shops selling electronic goods which, according to Mr Maduro, had sold items at vastly inflated prices. Hundreds of people flocked to the Daka stores after they were forced by the government to sell their goods at lower prices, some of them at a quarter of the price listed earlier in the week. "We're doing this for the good of the nation," the president said, accusing the managers of the stores of waging an "economic war" against Venezuela. He also announced the arrest of five managers from the Daka, JVG and Krash electronics stores on suspicion of hiking up prices. Five more people were arrested for allegedly looting a Daka shop in the city of Valencia. But President Maduro said reports of looting had been exaggerated by factions of the press, which he accused of "complicity with the bourgeois parasites". The president announced that he would next turn his attention to stores selling toys, cars, food items, textiles and shoes. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles said the move proved that the president "is a failed puppet of the Cuban government". "Every time he opens his mouth, he scares away the investments that create employment, and he worsens the crisis," said Mr Capriles, who narrowly lost to Mr Maduro in April's presidential election. Official figures suggest inflation is running at more than 50%. Price hikes have become an important issue in next month's local elections. Mr Maduro blames most of Venezuela's economic woes on "sabotage" by opposition forces, but critics say government mismanagement is behind the country's problems. Opponents say the president's crackdown on price inflation is an attempt to boost his popularity with poor voters ahead of the local polls on 8 December. Mr Maduro has asked the National Assembly to give him special powers to fight corruption and "economic sabotage". The measure is expected to be voted on this week. </body>

      <title>Jamaica failed drug tests 'tip of iceberg'</title>
      <description>Jamaica's most senior drug tester says the country's recent rash of failed tests might be the "tip of an iceberg".</description>

      <body>Jamaica's most senior drug tester says the country's recent rash of failed tests might be the "tip of an iceberg". Dr Paul Wright told the BBC that the Caribbean island's anti-doping regime had been woefully short of the international standards required. His comments come a week after the World Anti-Doping Agency visited Jamaica to investigate claims that the country's athletes were not being tested rigorously enough. Former Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission executive director Renee Anne Shirley sparked the crisis when she said the agency conducted just one out-of-competition test in the six months leading up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Her criticisms, made in an article in Sports Illustrated, followed a series of adverse findings involving Jamaican track and field athletes. Asafa Powell, the former 100m world record holder, was the biggest name to test positive, but four others including Powell's training partner - the Olympic relay gold medallist Sherone Simpson - also failed tests at the country's national trials in June. Both Powell and Simpson claim that they took supplements that might have been contaminated with the banned stimulant Oxilofrine. Wada officials are due to discuss their visit to Jamaica at an executive board meeting in Johannesburg on Tuesday and could make a series of recommendations to improve the country's anti-doping policies. But Dr Wright - a senior doping control officer with Jadco who has 30 years of experience of drug testing in sport - is concerned that Wada's intervention will not lead to the sweeping changes required to give the world confidence in Jamaican sport. And he said the sudden surge of athletes failing tests at the country's national trials in June had left him fearing the worst. "The results are not good," he told the BBC. "This year alone the results really point the finger. "Remember, all of these results except one were caught by Jadco. The problem is these people were tested positive in competition. What that means is months before you know the date of the test and the approximate time of the test. "So if you fail an in-competition test you haven't only failed a drugs test, you have failed an IQ test. "This could be the tip of the iceberg to have so many positives coming in competition. "What is going to convince me is if there is an out-of-competition test that's unannounced, that includes blood testing and which tests for EPO. Then we can hold up our heads high and say we know there's nothing." But the head of the Jamaican Olympic Association Mike Fennell dismissed Dr Wright's concerns, saying he was "being dramatic". "I think that's massively overstating it," Fennell said. "There's no evidence to suggest that it's the tip of the iceberg." Although Dr Wright met with Wada officials during their visit, he was critical, saying they did not spend enough time on the ground in Jamaica. "I have a personal problem in what you can do in 12 hours," he said. "They really came late Monday evening and left first flight Wednesday morning. So they were only really here on Tuesday. And four hours of that was at a dinner function with the Prime Minister. "It's not enough. Remember it was explained as an extraordinary audit. I would have loved them to have been here for a week, to have got answers to every question, to be able to question people who knew what was happening. "Their intervention has led to the promise of change. If the promises are kept then we will get there." Following Wada's visit, the Jamaican Minister for Sport Natalie Neita Headley vowed to pump more money in to testing to boost the current annual budget of just over £380,000. That funding - with the help of additional money from Wada - would be used to hire more senior executives to run the anti-doping programme and to hire and train additional drug testers. Mrs Headley told the BBC that she was currently hiring two extra drug testers, taking the total number of doping control officers to six. She also vowed to increase the number of tests conducted by Jadco from 300 this year to 400 in 2014. And she said the commission was ready to start blood testing its athletes. But, while Mrs Headley acknowledged there was a lot of work to be done, she said claims that Jamaica's top athletes had not been tested enough were wrong. She said: "Our athletes, as confirmed by the IAAF, were the most tested in the world of athletics, so to say your athletes weren't tested is not exactly true. "I would recognise that the events of the last couple of months would have harmed us tremendously. I recognise that. "I also recognise that what is important is that the country puts all of what is needed in place to beef up a system, bolster your system that where there might be weaknesses you strengthen, where there might be any difficulties that you remove those difficulties. "Though we are experiencing turbulent economic times, the budget of Jadco was increased this year unlike many other areas." Jadco has so far carried out 286 tests in 2013 - both in and out of competition. These are in addition to the tests conducted by the IAAF on a pool of 19 elite Jamaican athletes. These tests have taken place in competitions around the world but mainly in Europe and out of competition in the run up to the Moscow World Championships in August. Sports officials in Jamaica insist that, while their own testing regime needs to improve, there are no reasons to doubt the performances of top stars like triple Olympic champions Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price. Jamaican Olympic chief Fennell said he believed some of the positive tests had been caused by contaminated food supplements. "There is a problem worldwide with the use of supplements," said Fennell. "The whole world is induced to use supplements for one thing or another. "Athletes are no different. This is not with a view to cheating and I would put my head on the block and say our athletes do not set out to cheat. "We do have rigorous testing. If you look at the record for this year you will see our testing record is amazing. Those of our top athletes are on the registered international programmes. "More can be done and you tell me what country in the world where more cannot be done. A country like Jamaica has economic problems and we are doing extremely well with the resources we have but there's always room for more and we have to make sure we are up to speed." One of Jamaica's leading sprinters, Nesta Carter, said athletes understood that the events of the last few months had put him and his team-mates in the spotlight. "I understand why people pay more attention to Jamaica," said Carter, who won an individual bronze medal in the 100m in Moscow in August to add to his sprint relay gold from the London Olympics. "It was the same when the US dominated. People said they were on drugs and should be tested. That's a part of the sport and we have to accept that. It's going to hurt fans and athletes because no-one wants to be associated with what's going on. "It's kind of hard to see your fellow mates and people keep pointing the fingers at them and saying they are on drugs when they are not - so you just have to stay clean and do the right thing." </body>

      <body>A tropical cyclone that hit the north-eastern Somali region of Puntland over the weekend killed up to 100 people, the regional leader has told the BBC. Puntland's President Abdirahman Farole said thousands of livestock had also died and hundreds of homes had been destroyed. The semi-autonomous region was hit by strong winds, heavy rains and flash floods on Saturday and Sunday. Some fishermen have also been reported missing. The tropical cyclone, known as 03A, hit the Eyl, Beyla, Dangorayo and Hafun districts along the eastern coast and across to Alula at the tip of the Horn of Africa. "I have buried 10 members of my family, the icy storm and rain killed more than 100 people here," a resident of Eyl, Hussein Abdullahi, told the Reuters news agency. "I have never witnessed such fatal cold. Some people were blown away and others died after their houses collapsed on them." The storm was forecast to move inland and continue until Wednesday. Mr Farole called for international help, saying the crisis was "immense". "Preliminary information also indicates that homes, buildings, boats and entire villages have been destroyed and over 100,000 livestock lost, endangering the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local people," the government said, in a statement. Mohamed Aideed Dirir, Puntland's minister of planning, told the BBC Somali Service that more than 10 lorries loaded with food, water and blankets have been sent to the affected communities from the capital, Garowe, and the town of Bossasso. Electricity had been disrupted and mobile phone masts destroyed, making communication extremely difficult, Mr Dirir said. Eyl Deputy Commissioner Feisal Kali told the AFP news agency that "people are getting confused and the situation is getting worse". Many people in Puntland are poor, although it is rich in energy resources. The region is also a base for pirates who attack ships off the coast. </body>

      <body>The head of the presidential motorcade in Liberia has been arrested for allegedly smuggling drugs in an official vehicle, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has said. Perry Dolo was arrested with 297kg (654lb) of marijuana after crossing over from Sierra Leone, it alleged. The jeep used is "Escort 1", which normally leads President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's convoy, the DEA said. Mr Dolo had used the vehicle on his day off, it said. He has not yet commented on the allegation. Mr Dolo was arrested with a Liberian, a Guinean and a third person believed to be a member of the Sierra Leonean military, the DEA said. DEA head Anthony Souh said the accused were being interrogated. "They are still with me going through the process,'' he said. "We want to speedily send them to court... because the case is too high. Using a presidential car? It's too big." Security sources at the Bo-Waterside border crossing said Mr Dolo had been under surveillance for two weeks before he and the other three were apprehended at the weekend in the town of Tienne, about 20km (12 miles) inside Liberia and 120km west of the capital, Monrovia. "He [Mr Dolo] was not on duty, but he used the official car,'' Mr Souh said. The BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia says Liberia's DEA has in recent years stepped up efforts to curb marijuana farming in Liberia's countryside, but they often complain of a lack of resources. According to the 2012 UN Office on Drugs and Crime report, 9% of Liberian high school students use the drug, Liberia is recovering from a brutal civil war that ended about a decade ago. </body>

      <title>PM to lead trade delegation to China</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a trade delegation to China next month, he tells an audience in the City of London.</description>

      <body>David Cameron is to lead a delegation of ministers and business figures to China next month, he has announced. The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. "I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples," he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's "vast and varied markets" he said, adding: "This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come." Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the "global economy" was not a "zero sum game". "As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?' I believe we need to say a very firm 'No',". </body>

      <description>A senior leader of Pakistan's Haqqani militant group, Nasiruddin Haqqani, is shot dead by unidentified gunmen near the capital Islamabad.</description>

      <body>One of the most senior leaders of the Haqqani militant network has been shot dead near the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, security sources say. Nasiruddin Haqqani, who was in his early 30s, was the group's financier and a son of its founder Jalaluddin. Reports say his body has been taken for burial to the North Waziristan tribal area near the Afghan border. It is not clear who shot him or why. Nasiruddin Haqqani was on a US list of global terrorists. The details of his death are still unclear, but reports say he was killed in a shooting incident in the city of Rawalpindi, next to Islamabad, on Sunday night. Security sources confirmed the killing to the BBC. Other reports quoted militant sources and witnesses, who said unidentified gunmen on motorbikes sprayed Haqqani with bullets as he stopped to buy fresh bread from a bakery in the north-eastern outskirts of the capital. Another Haqqani brother, Badruddin, who had been the group's operational commander, was killed in a drone strike in August last year. Nasiruddin's elder brother, Sirajuddin Haqqani, now leads the group, while Jalaluddin remains its figurehead. As the group's main fundraiser, Nasiruddin frequently travelled to the oil-rich sheikhdoms of the Middle East to solicit donations. He represented the Haqqani network in last year's efforts to set up a Taliban office in Doha for peace talks with the United States. He was also the group's main contact person for pro-Taliban elements in Pakistan, as well as its representative with the Afghan Taliban. Unlike his father and many of his brothers, Nasiruddin Haqqani and two of his uncles did not live in Miran Shah in North Waziristan. He chose to base himself near Islamabad, from where he made his many journeys abroad to secure funds. Some sources said he had major business interests in the Gulf, including a transport company. Nasiruddin is not thought to have been publicly photographed. Those who have met him describe a tall, educated, well-dressed man who travelled in expensive cars and networked an extensive list of contacts all the time. They say his appearance gave no clue to his militant connections. His code name was "the doctor", possibly because of a degree that he had studied for. His death will be a major blow to the Haqqanis, who will need to find someone else to spearhead their efforts to secure financing. BBC correspondents say the killing will pile pressure on the Pakistani government because Nasiruddin's death happened on Pakistani soil. Afghan authorities will be angry that someone who had been working to facilitate peace moves with the Afghan Taliban has been removed from the picture. His death comes just 10 days after a US drone killed Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, who was also reported to be on the verge of entering peace talks with the government in Islamabad. Those moves towards talks are now over. His successor, the more hardline Mullah Fazlullah, swiftly ruled out any negotiations. Attempts to begin talks between the US, the Afghan Taliban and the government in Kabul have been stalled since June. </body>

      <body>Polish police have fired rubber bullets and tear gas to break up violent clashes during an independence day march in the capital Warsaw. A number of people were injured during the annual rally organised by far-right and nationalist movements. The violence started when groups of youths broke off from the main march to attack a squat and set fires to cars. They also set ablaze a rainbow-coloured arch symbolising tolerance, and tried to attack the Russian embassy. The protesters - many of them wearing masks - threw firecrackers at the diplomatic mission. Several youths also tried to scale the building's fence but were stopped by the police. "There is no justification for hooliganism," Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski said. The authorities also said that at least four police officers were among those injured during the violence. Thousands of people took part in the main march, which began noisily but peacefully. They carried white-and-red Polish flags and chanted: "God, honour, fatherland!" For the third year in a row violence broke out during the march, the BBC's Adam Easton reports. The rally commemorates the day Poland regained its independence at the end of World War One in 1918. Before that, Poland had been carved up between Russia, Prussia and the Austro-Hungarian empire. </body>

      <body>A defence lawyer for the imprisoned Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko has been detained by police, an opposition MP says. Prosecutors in Kiev are reported to be questioning the lawyer, Serhiy Vlasenko. But Fatherland MP Arseniy Yatsenyuk did not elaborate further. Ms Tymoshenko, a leader of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is being treated under prison guard for a back injury. Meanwhile, Ukraine has stopped importing Russian gas, officials say. Gas has been a thorny issue at the heart of Ukrainian politics for years. Ms Tymoshenko was given her seven-year jail term for abuse of power in 2011 over a controversial gas deal with Russia - a conviction she sees as politically-motivated. The EU is urging her release as a condition for signing a big trade deal. The wide-ranging association and free trade agreement with the EU would challenge Ukraine's traditionally close ties with Russia. The plan is to sign the deal in Lithuania at the end of this month, but the uncertainty about Ms Tymoshenko has fuelled doubt about whether it will go ahead. In a separate development, Ukraine has stopped importing Russian gas, amid a dispute about Ukrainian payments for gas deliveries. Ukraine's economy depends on imported Russian gas. The pipelines which run through Ukraine also carry Russian gas to other countries in Eastern and Central Europe. A Russian energy ministry company managing fuel exports said Ukraine's state energy firm Naftohaz Ukrainy stopped buying gas from Russia's Gazprom on Friday. A Gazprom official quoted by Reuters news agency said supplies to European clients via Ukraine were unaffected. There was mid-winter hardship in several European countries in 2006 and 2009 when gas supplies via Ukraine were disrupted. The Ukrainian government says Naftohaz Ukrainy has paid Gazprom for gas deliveries in October. But Gazprom director Alexei Miller said last month that Ukraine still owed $882m (£550m) for August deliveries. </body>

      <body>One of Egypt's top football clubs has excluded its striker from a competition for publicly showing support for ousted President Mohammed Morsi. Al Ahly said Ahmed Abdul Zaher would not go to next month's Fifa Club World Cup in Morocco after he gave a four-fingered salute on Sunday. The striker was celebrating his goal in the final of the African Champions League, which Al Ahly won 2-0. The gesture has become a symbol of solidarity with Mr Morsi. It commemorates a Cairo sit-in by supporters of the Islamist president which was violently dispersed by the security forces in August, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people. Mr Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - is currently on trial on charges of inciting the killing of protesters during clashes in the capital last year. He was ousted in July. Abdul Zaher celebrated with the four-finger gesture (Rabaa) after scoring the second goal in Al Ahly's 2-0 win over South Africa's Orlando Pirates. "Yes, I raised the sign of Rabaa," he was quoted as saying by Egypt's football website FilGoal. "But I didn't mean political excitement to any one side or fan. All I meant to do was to remember the dead, whether in Rabaa, any other citizen and even policemen.'' On Monday, Al Ahly officials said he would be excluded from the squad for the Morocco competition. Meanwhile, Egyptian Sports Minister Taher Abu Zeid said the player's "grave insult" could not go unpunished. The minister said he was confident that both the club and the Egyptian Football Association would take action. Abdul Zaher is the second leading Egyptian sportsman to be penalised for publicly backing Mr Morsi, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo reports. Last month, champion kung fu fighter Mohammed Youssef was banned from competing at home and abroad for two years after using the same gesture at a medal ceremony. The move added to growing concerns about freedom of speech under Egypt's new military-backed government. </body>

      <title>Assad opponents agree talks position</title>
      <description>Syria's main opposition alliance, the National Coalition, says it will attend peace talks in Geneva, if a number of conditions are met.</description>

      <body>Syria's main opposition alliance says it will attend planned peace talks, if a number of conditions are met. After a vote early on Monday, the National Coalition reiterated that President Bashar al-Assad would "have no role in the transitional period". Before any meeting, relief agencies had to be given access to besieged areas and all detainees, particularly women and children, had to be freed, it said. The Syrian government has rejected any preconditions for the Geneva talks. The UN, US and Russia had been trying to convene the meeting by the end of November. But UN-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said last week that the conference would be delayed, although he was still "striving" for a summit by the end of the year. The National Coalition reached the agreement after two days of talks in Istanbul. A statement released by the office of Monzer Azbik, the chief of staff to the coalition's leader, repeated the group's demand that President Assad step down in any transitional government. "Bashar al-Assad will have no role in the transitional period and the future of Syria,'' it said. The coalition also outlined conditions that must be met before the talks, including a guarantee of access for relief agencies. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the result of the vote was encouraging. "This is a big step forward and an important one," he told reporters in Abu Dhabi. The US, UN and Russia have been trying for months to convince both the Syrian government and opposition to accept a political solution to the 32-month-old conflict based on the core elements of the final communique issued in June 2012 after a meeting of the UN-backed Action Group for Syria in Geneva. The so-called Geneva Communique called for an immediate cessation of violence and the establishment of a transitional government that could include officials serving under Mr Assad and members of the opposition. The government has said it will "in principle" attend the conference. However, it has also said it will not negotiate with "terrorists", while dismissing almost all those who oppose it as such. It has also insisted repeatedly that any political solution will not involve Mr Assad's departure, Ahmed Jarba, the head of the National Coalition, had already indicated a willingness to attend the Geneva talks. But several of the major rebel fighting groups have refused to recognise its authority and rejected the idea of negotiations. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. Aid agencies have warned that more than nine million Syrians, almost half the population are now in need of humanitarian relief. </body>

      <description>A group of leading UK aid charities launches an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon Haiyan.</description>

      <body>UK aid charities have launched an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) said it was already responding but there was still a desperate need for water, food and emergency shelter. It will make a televised appeal on Tuesday evening. Earlier David Cameron announced an increase in UK aid. Typhoon Haiyan is feared to have killed up to 10,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The DEC, a group of 14 leading UK aid organisations, said the relief effort was being severely hampered by roads made impassable and airports closed by the typhoon. "The destruction in Tacloban city, on the east coast, is said to be reminiscent of the Boxing Day tsunami," the committee's chief executive Saleh Saeed said. "There is currently no food, water or electricity. We can only imagine how much worse the situation will be for families living in towns and remote villages. "DEC members are doing all they can to get aid through but they need a huge injection of funds in order to do so. The priorities are getting food, water and shelter to people in desperate need." UK broadcasters the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, Channel 5 and other outlets will show the appeal following early evening news programmes. The DEC comprises the charities Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said there was a danger that if enough aid was not delivered quickly it would be pregnant women and children who missed out. "All the organisations - Save the Children, Oxfam, all the others, the United Nations - are there ready to help," he said. "We need to land the planes, we need to offload them and then we need to get aid to people." Meanwhile the UK government said it was increasing its aid to the country from £6m to £10m. The money will pay for aid flights to Cebu in the east of the country, the delivery of temporary shelters, blankets and water purification tablets and sanitation equipment for 300k people. Mr Cameron has also announced that the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Darling will soon head to the disaster zone from Singapore. It would take five days to arrive but once in the Philippines brings engineering and first aid expertise as well as the use of a Lynx helicopter. The ship also carries equipment to make drinking water from sea water. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu. Among other states to have pledged aid are Australia, Aus$9m (£5.8m) and New Zealand, NZ$2.15m (£1.1m). China, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, the US, Vietnam, European Commission and the UN have also announced support. The aid effort comes after a state of "national calamity" was announced by Philippines President Benigno Aquino. On Friday one of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Reports on Monday said 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected - with many now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. </body>

      <title>Davey: Energy users 'not cash cows'</title>
      <description>Gas and electricity customers should not be "cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say.</description>

      <body>Gas and electricity customers are "not just cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say. In a speech later, the Liberal Democrat minister will call on the industry to "open up your books" to show how it is trying to minimise tariffs. Millions of customers face price rises for gas and electricity this winter. But industry body Energy UK complained that a "tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults" was developing. Four of the UK's six main energy companies have recently announced price rises, with an average increase of 9.1%, and the other two are expected to follow suit soon. The firms say the rises are largely due to increasing wholesale prices, but critics say they are unfair and will lead households into difficulties with bills. In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. He has accused the coalition of doing too little to help keep tariffs down. But the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In his speech to the annual conference of Energy UK, which represents the industry, in London on Tuesday, Mr Davey will argue that companies need to make enough money to invest in greener technologies. He will add: "But those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. "Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. "It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up." Mr Davey will say: "Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks." He will tell companies: "You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public - and the public must have trust in what you do." Mr Davey will say the government is looking at how to reduce the impact of its policies on bills, adding: "But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible." He will also tell industry leaders they face a "Fred the Shred" moment, in reference to the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood after leading the bank to near-collapse in 2008. But Labour's shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said: "David Cameron's out-of-touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis." "Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. "It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say." Energy UK, meanwhile, said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. "The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. "As analysis from UBS shows, about 95% of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs." </body>

      <body>A second company controlled by the Brazilian former billionaire Eike Batista has filed for bankruptcy protection. Shipbuilding firm OSX Brasil made the filing in a Rio de Janeiro court less than two weeks after its sister oil company, OGX, also declared bankruptcy. Mr Batista is one of Brazil's best known businessmen, and once boasted a fortune estimated at $30bn (£18.8bn). But investors have recently lost confidence in his vast business empire. The group of businesses, collectively known as EBX, cover energy, mining and logistics. Shipbuilder OSX is estimated to have debts of about $2.3bn. Last month its sister company OGX sought protection from creditors with debts of $4.8bn - the largest bankruptcy filing in Latin America. Under Brazilian law, OSX will now have 60 says to come up with a debt restructuring plan. But even if a plan is agreed, the bankruptcies mark a remarkable downfall for Mr Batista, who was once ranked as the seventh richest man in the world. His problems began last year, when OGX announced that its oil production would be a quarter of its initial forecast, resulting a huge decline in its share price. Analysts say the company secured large loans, promising payment through oil that it had not yet begun pumping. </body>

Exporters were helped by a softer yen, as the dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese currency. In Shanghai, shares rose 0.5% and South Korean shares rose 0.9%. But the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose by just 0.1%. Overnight, US stocks had edged up, lifting the benchmark Dow Jones to another record closing high. The dollar moved as high as 99.59 yen, its highest since 20 September, lifting exporters like Sony and Advantest, which climbed 3.6% and 3.2%. The Nikkei 225 index gained 318.84 points to 14,588.68, Meanwhile, Japan's broader Topix index rose by 1.67%, or 19.76 points, to 1,205.41. The positive Asian news came after a three-day run of losses on local stock markets. "The recent decline opened up room for bargain-hunting, but thin trading volume underscores investors' search for clues on the timeline for the Fed's stimulus cutback," said Lim Dong-rak, an analyst at Hanyang Securities in Seoul. </body>

      <description>Novak Djokovic retains his ATP World Tour Finals title with a convincing win over world number one Rafael Nadal.</description>

      <body>Novak Djokovic retained his ATP World Tour Finals title with a convincing win over world number one Rafael Nadal. The Serb, who lost the top ranking to Nadal last month, won 6-3 6-4 at the O2 Arena in London. Djokovic, 26, extended his unbeaten run to 22 matches as he claimed the season-ending title for the third time. He will now head to Belgrade, where Serbia take on the Czech Republic in the Davis Cup final from Friday. Nadal might have earned the year-end number one ranking after his remarkable return from injury in February, but Djokovic denied him a first ATP Finals title and laid down a marker for battles to come in 2014. "It's the highest quality of tennis that you have next to Grand Slams, because every match that you play, you play against a top 10 player every second day," said Djokovic. "Especially this year, with back to back Paris Bercy tournament and London, wasn't easy for sure. "I am very proud of the way that I managed to recover and perform better and better as the tournament went on. "I had the tough three setters against all of the opponents in my group, and then I managed to raise the level of tennis in the semi-finals and finals when it mattered the most." Nadal paid tribute to the crowd for the vibrant atmosphere they created. "This is probably one of the best seasons of my career and playing this match in this stadium is just fantastic for me," said Nadal. "Thanks to all the crowd for all the support, not only today but around the week and all the crowd that supported me. See you next year." Always the happier of the two playing indoors, the pace and depth of Djokovic's returns in particular put pressure on Nadal and played a major part in the Spaniard double-faulting four times in the opening set. In a blistering start, Djokovic was one point from going 4-0 clear as he stood up to the baseline and returned Nadal's firepower with interest. However, a missed backhand on break point let the Spaniard off the hook, and Djokovic's game briefly deserted him. An unexpected sliced backhand from Nadal caught the Serb off guard and drew an error that allowed the top seed back into the set, but Djokovic gathered himself to hold for 4-3 and then launched another assault. Two double-faults from a nervous Nadal opened the door and a stinging forehand return onto the baseline endangered the Spaniard's toes, before Djokovic broke with a breathtaking example of his ability to turn defence into attack. With Nadal bearing down on the net to finish the point, Djokovic chased to his right and lifted a beautiful lob over his opponent, before moving in and angling away a volley. A clenched fist and a roar let everyone know just how big a moment Djokovic thought that was and, thanks in part to a kindly net cord at 15-30, he closed out the set in the following game with an ace. Nadal, 27, might have won three of his five meetings with Djokovic this year but the Serb won comfortably last time out in Beijing, and when the Spaniard began spraying forehands early in the second set, a repeat looked on the cards. Djokovic converted his third break point for a 2-1 lead with yet another deep return that Nadal could not handle, and he had two points to break for a fourth time. Nadal clung on, pumping his fist to show he was still up for the fight, but Djokovic has made the O2 Arena a fortress over the last two years and he moved untroubled towards a 10th straight win at the venue. One match point slipped past on the Nadal serve and another on his own, but Djokovic got the victory he so desperately wanted to end his season on a high when the world number one blazed a forehand wide. There was success for Spain in the doubles, though, and for the second straight year, with Fernando Verdasco and David Marrero beating Bob and Mike Bryan to follow in the footsteps of Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez. The Bryan brothers were going for their 12th title of a season that saw them come within two victories of a calendar Grand Slam. But they were edged out on a match tie-break, with Verdasco and Marrero winning 7-5 6-7 (3-7) 10-7.

      <title>Bailey and Johnson in Australia squad</title>
      <description>Uncapped batsman George Bailey and pace bowler Mitchell Johnson are named in Australia's squad for the first Ashes Test.</description>

      <body>Uncapped batsman George Bailey and pace bowler Mitchell Johnson have been named in Australia's 12-man squad for the first Ashes Test against England. Bailey, 31, edged out fellow Tasmanian Alex Doolan after impressing as stand-in captain of Australia's one-day team. Left-armer Johnson, 32, was dropped for Australia's 3-0 Ashes defeat in England this summer, but showed good form in the one-day series in September. The first of five Tests starts in Brisbane on 21 November. Injured left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc is the only absentee from the Australia XI that played in the final Ashes Test at The Oval in August. James Faulkner keeps his place, while fellow all-rounder Shane Watson is included despite a hamstring injury that may prevent him from bowling. Bailey has a modest first-class average of 38.28 from 97 games, but has been a revelation for Australia in the 50-over format. In 35 matches, he has scored 1,539 runs at 54.96, including four scores in excess of 80 in the recent one-day series defeat by India. "We have included George Bailey in this line-up and are excited by what he can offer at Test level," said Cricket Australia national selector John Inverarity. "George has shown outstanding international form over the past 20 months. He is calm and composed and comes into the squad full of confidence." After bowling Australia to victory in Perth in the 2010-11 Ashes, Johnson was taken apart by England in Melbourne and Sydney and became a figure of fun among the touring fans  as his bowling became increasingly wayward. He has taken 205 wickets in 51 Tests, but has not played a Test since March, when he failed to take a wicket as India beat Australia by six wickets in Delhi to complete a 4-0 whitewash. However, he looked back to his best in the one-day series in England that followed the Ashes, clocking speeds of up to 93mph. "Mitchell Johnson has been bowling impressively in recent times," said Inverarity. "He has good rhythm and is generating good pace." Australia captain Michael Clarke added: "I said a few days ago, if Mitch was selected in this squad, it wouldn't surprise me in a couple of months' time to see Mitch being man of the series." Watson, who scored a century against England at The Oval this year, suffered a low-grade hamstring strain while bowling in Australia's final one-day international against India on 2 November. Should Watson not be fit to bowl, Faulkner could be preferred to Bailey to offer a fifth bowling option. "We could play five batsmen and five bowlers, or we could play four quicks and no spinners, or three quicks and one spinner," said Inverarity. "We're hoping Watson will be able to bowl. He's progressing very well and he'll certainly be fit to play. But it's nine days to go, so we can't give a definitive answer on that." Alastair Cook's team are seeking to become the first England side since 1890 to win four Ashes series in a row Australia are unbeaten in their last 24 Tests in Brisbane, their last defeat at the venue coming against the West Indies in 1988. Australia squad: Michael Clarke (captain), Brad Haddin (vice-captain, wk), George Bailey, James Faulkner, Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Lyon, Chris Rogers, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, David Warner, Shane Watson. </body>

      <title>Massa deal 'shows Williams ambition'</title>
      <description>Signing Felipe Massa is proof that Williams can return to winning ways, says deputy team principal Claire Williams.</description>

      <body>Williams say signing Brazilian Felipe Massa from Ferrari is proof they are determined to return to winning ways after years of declining form. Williams dominated Formula 1 for much of the 1980s and '90s but have scored only one point this year. Deputy team principal Claire Williams said: "We've done a lot of work this year in order to turn this team around and we want to tell the world that. "Williams are not satisfied with coming ninth in the championship." She said Massa's decision to join the team alongside Finn Valtteri Bottas was the latest in a series of moves aimed at revitalising the former world champions. They have already signed a deal to switch from Renault to Mercedes engines, taken on a new technical director in Pat Symonds, who has won world titles with Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso at Benetton/Renault, and further changes in engineering staff are on the way. Williams said: "We've made some very clear decisions this year from announcing the Mercedes partnership to bringing in a new technical director in Pat Symonds, and this [signing Massa] is another piece of our jigsaw to tell the world that Williams is determined to come back and determined to fight for world championships again." Williams said persuading Massa, a 32-year-old 11-time grand prix winner, to join "wasn't actually too hard a sell - it's so clear to see this team is made up of fighters and people who want to win F1 races". Williams have been on a downward trend in recent years, halted only by an upturn in form in 2012, when they won their first race since 2004 thanks to Pastor Maldonado at the Spanish Grand Prix. Massa has been signed as replacement for the Venezuelan, who is now likely to drive for Lotus but also has options at Force India and Sauber. "Pastor has done a great job for Williams these three seasons and it's a shame he's leaving us, but he wants to go on and find a new challenge," said Williams, who described Bottas as "a real talent" and said partnering Massa with him is "really exciting". Williams are in the middle of a recruitment drive aimed at strengthening the team. One of the new signings will be Massa's Ferrari race engineer Rob Smedley, who is joining ahead of 2014 in a more senior role overseeing race engineering. Smedley has become famous for his down-to-earth radio communication with Massa in the past few years, including the notorious "Fernando [Alonso] is faster than you" message when Ferrari imposed team orders on their drivers at the 2010 German Grand Prix. Asked whether Smedley had signed, Claire Williams said: "We're working very hard to address the problems we have in-house. We have some great talent in Williams but we need to make sure we have all the talent we need to perform right at the top. "So I'm hoping that before the end of the season or maybe slightly after we'll be making some more announcements in a similar vein to this one [Massa]. Whether that involves a certain engineer or other engineers I can't tell you." She emphasised that any deal with Smedley was independent of Massa. "They don't come as a package," she said. "They come separately. They are very much their own people. "So if Rob Smedley was to join our team, it has to be on his terms, and he has to be given a role he wants to do and that may or may not be Felipe's race engineer. "Felipe is grown-up enough to join a team without bringing his race engineer with him." </body>

      <title>Iranian band members shot dead in NY</title>
      <description>Three Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, are shot dead by another Iranian musician in what police called a murder-suicide.</description>

      <body>Four Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, have been shot dead in what authorities are labelling a murder-suicide. Two members of the group Yellow Dogs and a third artist were slain by a fellow musician, Ali Akbar Mahammadi Rafie, who later took his own life. Police believe the attack happened as Rafie, 29, was upset after being thrown out of another band. Two of those killed had just received political asylum in the US. They were brothers and members of the Yellow Dogs, who described themselves on their Twitter feed as "a Post Punk/Dance Punk band from Tehran/Iran, living in Brooklyn at the moment". Gunfire rang out early on Monday as Rafie climbed from the roof on to a third-floor terrace where he opened fire through a window, shooting dead Ali Eskandarian, 35, a musician, said police. Arash Farazmand, 28, the Yellow Dogs drummer, was found dead on the same level of the apartment. His brother, Soroush Farazmand, 27, the band's guitarist, was using his laptop in bed when he received fatal gunshot injuries. The Yellow Dogs' two other members were not at the flat at the time of the killing. According to police, another unidentified tenant was hit in the arm as Rafie and a former fellow band mate from a group called the Free Keys struggled over the gun. Rafie retrieved ammunition that had fallen out of the firearm, went to the roof and shot himself in the head, said police. The person wounded in the arm was taken to hospital and is said to be in stable condition. Rafie "was upset that he wasn't in the band anymore", said New York Police Department spokesman John McCarthy. Investigators believe the gunman and his former Free Keys members, may have had an argument over money, but it was unclear why he shot at members of the Yellow Dogs. The rifle was found next to Rafie's body, according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. He said it had been purchased in New York state in 2006, and police were tracking its history. Police are investigating whether a guitar case found near the scene was used to carry the assault rifle in the attack. The Yellow Dogs were well-known among young Iranian expatriates in the US, reports Bahman Kalbasi of the BBC Persian service. Ali Salehezadeh, the band's manager, said the gunman knew the victims but had not spoken to them in months because of a "petty conflict". "There was a decision not to be around each other," he said. "They were never that close to begin with. We thought it was all behind us." The shooting took place in Brooklyn's East Williamsburg neighbourhood, known for its edgy, creative vibe and community of artists and musicians. The band members had lived in the neighbourhood. "They seem like really nice guys," a local man, Martin Greenman, told the New York Daily News. "They didn't seem to be in any way to be violent guys. They weren't rabble rousers or anything like that." Mr Salehezadeh said the victims' relatives were stunned. "People don't own guns in Iran," he said. "We don't have this problem there. It doesn't exist." Members of an Iranian band with the same name were interviewed by US consulate officials in Istanbul in 2009 as they applied for a visa for a US tour, according to a diplomatic cable leaked to Wikileaks. They described the "small but crazy" underground rock scene in Tehran, saying it was the community that offered "the most free expression" in Iran. </body>

      <body>The stars of a new stage adaptation of Jeeves and Wooster have said the popularity of dramas like Downton Abbey could boost the new show's box office. Stephen Mangan and Ripper Street's Matthew MacFadyen respectively play the hapless toff and his faithful valet. Mangan said: "It's almost a fantasy, that turn of the century England where people are good eggs." "It's a bit like the Downton vision of England and it was hugely popular in America for that reason." "It's just like Downton because we like to see this prettied up version of England," he said. The new show. Perfect Nonsense, is directed by Sean Foley and is based on PG Wodehouse's 1938 novel The Code of the Woosters. The story sees Bertie Wooster unwittingly called on to play matchmaker - reconciling the affections of Madeline Bassett with his newt-fancying acquaintance Gussie Fink-Nottle. Wodehouse, who died in 1975, aged 93, is undergoing something of a revival. Earlier this year, BBC One broadcast a TV adaptation of his Blandings Castle stories, with another series commissioned for next year. Birdsong author Sebastian Faulks has also written a new book, Jeeves and The Wedding Bells, after being asked by the Wodehouse estate to bring the "immortal" characters to life. "I hope my story will ring bells with aficionados, but also bring new readers to these wonderful books," he added. The characters were memorably played on TV by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the 1990s. Mangan, star of Green Wing and Episodes, holds Wodehouse up as one of the funniest writers of all time, and said his enduring popularity would stand the new show in good stead. "The Wodehouse fan base is already massive and we've had a lot of interest from the moment it was announced that we were doing it because apart from a musical that Lloyd Webber did in the 70s, they've never been played on stage. "But yes, fans of Downton, anyone who likes period drama, will maybe look our way." Jeeves and Wooster opens on 12 November. </body>

      <body>Ships have been evacuated off the coast of southern China, after Typhoon Haiyan triggered strong winds and heavy rain. After killing thousands of people in the Philippines, the typhoon was downgraded to a tropical storm. It made landfall in north Vietnam near the border with China, triggering evacuations across the region, as Paul Collins reports. </body>

      <title>Brazil at odds over anti-NSA net law</title>
      <description>New internet law causes controversy following NSA leaks</description>

      <body>Along with Russia, China and Iran, Brazil was one of the countries of most interest for US intelligence agencies, according to the leaks from the US National Security Agency (NSA). But whereas those other countries may not have appeared too surprised by the extent of US spying, Brazil was outraged. Documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, indicated that the agency had monitored internal Brazilian government communications, had spied on the state oil company, and had even intercepted data from President Dilma Rousseff's own office. In response, Ms Rousseff cancelled a trip to Washington. In an angry speech at the United Nations General Assembly, she accused the US of breaking international law. "Friendly governments and societies that seek to build a true strategic partnership, as in our case, cannot allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they were normal," she exclaimed. "They are unacceptable." Together with Germany, Brazil also put forward a resolution calling for an end to excessive electronic surveillance. Customers at the Cyber Gol internet café in Catete, a commercial district near the centre of Rio de Janeiro, overwhelmingly agree with President Rousseff's response. "It's a scandal," Paula Fladel, a 42-year old businesswoman, tells the BBC. "I was outraged at the arrogant, overbearing meddling that the US carries out in practically the whole of the world." Joanne Lima, a 22-year old student, says the US has taken advantage of its technological expertise. "They want to play the part of the world's policeman. Not only in Brazil, but in other countries too," she says. "The Brazilian government must take stronger measures to protect our privacy." In fact, Brazil is considering further action. At the end of October, President Rousseff granted what is termed "constitutional urgency" to new legislation on internet usage. After two years crawling through congress, the Marco Civil da Internet - a civil rights framework for internet users and providers - must now be debated ahead of all other parliamentary business. The bill includes measures to protect users' privacy and right to free speech and would prohibit internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating between different types of content. But in the rush to respond to her citizens' anger over US data intercepts, the president has insisted on an amendment which critics argue could lead to Brazil ending up with a substandard version of the net. President Rousseff wants all internet companies operating in Brazil to store copies of personal information on their Brazilian clients in the country. By doing so, the firms providing cloud services would become subject to local privacy laws. But the most prominent supporters of the original version of the bill think that not only will the amendment fail to secure individual's data, it will also drive up the costs for companies operating in Brazil, and impede local innovation. Rodrigo Lemos is the director of the Institute of Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro and one of the architects of the Marco Civil. "This forced local data storage will make internet companies flee from Brazil," he says. "Brazilian internet users will have a second class service compared to Americans or Europeans. "Websites offering services to Brazilians will have to worry about building a data centre in Brazil." Data storage in Brazilian is costly in comparison to both neighbouring countries and the US. Figures from 2012 indicate Brazil has more than 86 million internet users. Social networks are hugely popular in a country where telephone services are still expensive and patchy. The Latin American giant is second only to the US in terms of individual Facebook users. On making a new acquaintance, Brazilians are more likely to invite each other to continue the relationship on "Face" than they are to ask for a phone number. Brazil also boasts the world's second-largest number of Twitter users. With the social media market in the US and Europe close to saturation point, China's internet users limited in their freedoms, and India's digital revolution still in its infancy, Brazil is set to play an increasingly important role in shaping the global rules governing social media users' data. Critics worry that President Rousseff's proposed legislation could set a precedent that other countries, with less regard for freedom of speech, might follow. But Glenn Greenwald, the Brazil-based journalist who reported Edward Snowden's leaked material, says this is a natural reaction to the anger the NSA's activities have provoked. "I think a lot of countries are going to start to look for ways in which they don't have to be dependent on US infrastructure," says the writer who previously reported for the Guardian newspaper. "One of the ways that the NSA currently intercepts people's data is by physically invading their telecommunications systems through using American companies that have access to their systems. "The more means that are cut off for the NSA to be intercepting this data, I think the more secure these systems will become." Given the widespread opposition to the proposal, it is not clear whether it will survive the final draft of the bill, due to be voted on this week. But the government has indicated that if its idea of local data storage does not form part of the Marco Civil, it will seek to draft separate legislation enshrining the proposal in law at a later date. </body>

      <title>Escape to Oz</title>
      <description>Young Europeans head to Australia in search of work</description>

      <body>Australia has become a haven for disillusioned young Europeans eager to plot an escape from economic troubles at home. Migration from countries such as Ireland is at levels not seen since the 1980s as Australia's seemingly bulletproof economy, insulated from the global slowdown by a roaring mining industry, offers the chance of a fresh beginning. But there are concerns that a flood of migrants in their early-to-mid-20s from Ireland and elsewhere on temporary working visas is squeezing young Australians out of the jobs market. "If we look at between 15-19-year-olds, we have 14.5% unemployment. Still well below many other places in the world but still significant enough to say that we aren't absorbing and giving skill opportunities to many young Australians, so the government has failed to get the balance right," says Tony Sheldon, from the Australian Transport Workers Union. "That means that labour has been brought in as an alternative, which is being more exploited, [has] less rights and [is] seen as a cheap form of labour but also an exploited form of labour." he says. He fears that foreigners could also be under-paid and mistreated by unscrupulous bosses. On a wild and blustery evening at Bondi Beach, Aoife Fahey and her friends frolic in the shallows after work. Ireland's chronic financial problems seem a world away as the surf crashes into Sydney's famous arc of sand, yet building a new life isn't easy. "[It's] a lot harder than people make out, 'Come over to Australia, there's loads of jobs, [it's] so easy.' It is not like that at all, no matter what you're working in. It's for lads a lot easier, but for girls it's hard," says Aoife, from Castlebar in County Mayo, who arrived in Australia six months ago and works in an Irish pub. Her friend, Michaela Kelly, from Drogheda, earns twice as much working in an office in Sydney than she did in Ireland. Like many Irish backpackers Michaela is well qualified with a degree in business. But with youth unemployment so stubbornly high in Australia, soaring up to 40% in parts of its major cities does she feel guilty that she could be taking a job from a local? "Is that bad if I say no?" she asks. "Irish workers come over here to work and they work hard because at home you are made to work hard, whereas Australians over here are just so laid back, they put things off and don't do it, basically. So, I don't feel bad." Most Irish backpackers arrive on one-year working holiday permits, which can be extended or upgraded to longer employment visas that can lead to residency and eventually citizenship although the process can take years. Australia owes an incalculable economic debt to successive waves of immigration over the decades, including legions of settlers from Ireland but academics now worry that a lack of training could increasingly leave young Australians unable to compete with temporary foreign workers especially in low or unskilled jobs. "It is important to think about where future immigrants are going and whether that competition could emerge," says Anna Boucher, from the University of Sydney. "I don't see it really coming out currently, but I see it potentially being a problem in the future. For instance, somewhere like the Northern Territory that has very high rates of indigenous youth unemployment but which is being signalled as an area for potential regional migration agreements in the future." Australia is grappling with chronic skills shortages in many sectors while seeking antidotes to worrying rates of jobless among its young. Meanwhile, this vast nation continues to invite those seeking work from afar to its shores. "You're watching [TV shows] Neighbours and Home And Away and you're just expecting everything to be perfect," says Denise Murtagh, who arrived in Sydney from Dublin with her best friend only a week ago. "But it is tough going because you're basically living out of a bag. You're moving from place to place every few days." "We haven't a clue what we are doing at the minute," adds Sinead Keane, who has come armed with a degree in business and sports management. "There's thousands of people in the same boat as us looking for jobs so I suppose you just have to talk to people and hope they help you out along the way." The Irish government says it's confident that parts of the diaspora in Sydney and beyond will succumb to the magnetic pull of home when the scars of the financial crisis eventually heal. But, for now, as the exodus of the young continues, Ireland's loss is Australia's gain. </body>

      <title>Women bankers break through in India</title>
      <description>How women are calling the shots at some of India's top banks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24867346</url>

      <body>Women have always worked in India, but the rise of the corporate woman in the last two decades in the banking sector has been phenomenal. India has no fewer than eight female banking bosses - indeed the appointment of Arundhati Bhattacharya as the first chairwoman of the country's largest bank, the State Bank of India, came days before the announcement of the new Federal Reserve nominee in the US, Janet Yellen. It's a stark contrast to places like the UK, where women run the British arm of international banks, but there are no overall female bosses. So how has India done it? And the reason for it is very simple, according to Chanda Kochhar, the chief executive of ICICI, the country's second largest bank - the company promoted on merit, not gender. "When you have an organisation that is gender neutral, and when you have a woman who is willing to give to her job whatever it takes, whether it's long hours, whether it's commitment to travel, irrespective of the fact that she's a woman, I think women get that opportunity to rise," she says. There were, of course, sacrifices. "What it required on my part was to really give to the job whatever it took. So yes, there were children at home, but if the job demands travel, hard work, long hours of work, I think you need to give it." ICICI is seen by many within the industry as a training ground for ambitious women. Typically, a third of its intake will be female, and the bank has made a point of nurturing talent and creating a whole crop of successful women. They include Shikha Sharma, chief executive of Axis Bank. "There's no substitute for meritocracy and there's no substitute for hard work," she says. "But there is the issue of women having the belief that they can make it, and everybody in society becoming sensitive to the fact that women can make it. "The presence of more women helps both those beliefs to happen, for women to have the belief, and for society to have the sensitivity to understand that yes, women bring a different level of contribution." Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management in south Mumbai trains those who will be the corporate bosses of the future, and counts Chanda Kochhar as a former student. Each year, the institute takes 125 young men and women, and competition to get in is fierce, with around 1,000 applications per place. Student Aditi Agarwal says she's very ambitious, but has had her own battles to get on. "I think women are just tired of being at home, they want to break out of those shackles," she says. "I can say this from experience - when I decided to study further for my chartered accountancy course, I didn't get a lot of support from my extended family. There was that mindset to have kids, make dinner for your husband - that's what's expected of you. "But I want to work, I want to make a contribution. I have a personal sense of identity." Fellow student Ekta Ambekar says there are lots of female role models now in banking, and she's sure she'll have the same chance to succeed as men. "Women are surely breaking the glass ceiling, and after all it's more about the talent that you have, and less about all the social constraints. It's always the talent and hard work that pays… your work speaks for itself." So why has banking distinguished itself when it comes to promoting women? According to Tarjani Vakil, who was India's first female banking chief executive in the 1990s, the sector expanded in the 1970s when banks were nationalised, and that coincided with increasing numbers of middle-class women entering the workplace. For her, it was lonely being the only woman at the top, but banking was always seen as a good job for women. "Women joined because it was a dream job for them," she says. "Banks were well organised. It was a safe place to work, because you didn't have to go to a factory, so the family didn't object. Women went to the office, sat in an air-conditioned office, and were very happy. "It was glamorous, and money is always glamour." She says at the outset the ceiling was concrete rather than glass, but that now it's been well and truly smashed. The structure of Indian society allows for issues like childcare to be less of a problem than in the West. The prevalence of extended families means that grandparents are around if a woman goes out to work, and all middle-class women have domestic help. Those women who have made it to the top will probably have had these advantages, as well as working hard for their success. India remains a largely conservative society, with traditional attitudes about the role of women in many regions. The country did a lot of soul-searching about its treatment of women after a brutal rape in the capital last year. But despite the major social challenges the country faces, the corporate world seems to have set its own progressive standards, particularly in the financial sector. Some think other industries will soon follow suit. P Vaidyanathan Iyer, the editor of the Mumbai edition of the Indian Express, says the educated middle-class now equals 250 million people - and it's the sheer size of that still growing white-collar workforce that bodes well for the future. "I'm sure in the next few years, or the next decade or so, you will have women doing very well in sectors like healthcare and information technology where we have a middle ground now of very successful and bright women in the middle-corporate levels. "These are areas where we have built a huge workforce of women, and it won't be surprising that you will find more chief executives." The problems of poverty and social inequality in wider Indian society persist. But in banking at least there has been a female corporate revolution - and this could be just the beginning. </body>

      <title>Iran voices: Rouhani's first 100 days</title>
      <description>Iranians give verdicts on president's first 100 days in office</description>

      <body>The moderate conservative cleric Hassan Rouhani is marking his first 100 days in office as Iran's president. Mr Rouhani succeeded Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, after winning just over 50% of the vote in Iran's presidential election, avoiding the need for a run-off. Unity was a big theme in Mr Rouhani's inauguration speech to parliament on 4 August, in which he said he would represent all Iranians. Here, people in Iran reflect on his first 100 days in charge and give their verdict on his achievements so far. I'm happy with this president. He doesn't embarrass me as an Iranian. In fact, he gives me some hope. He is politically savvy and smart. He may not have done anything ground breaking yet, but he has not contradicted himself, nor has anyone higher up contradicted him. Bread and meat is still expensive, but two things have changed. Firstly, hope has given a boost to investor confidence. Secondly, social pressures are less. You can finally breathe in Tehran. To some extent he has started to deliver on his domestic political reforms - such as freeing some political prisoners and on foreign policy, with his charm offensive in his UN speech and telephone conversation with President Obama. He's on the right track - especially on foreign policy. He now needs to engage intimately and openly with Saudi Arabia. He also needs to reverse the brain drain and invite educated Iranians to return to Iran to help build the economy. He needs to reverse the deep corruption and moral decline that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad planted in Iranian ethos. Iran has seen a disgusting moral decay in the past eight years and it will take generations to fix it. But, so far, so good. After 100 days of this presidency, there has been little concrete achievement. There is a lot of blaming everything on the last administration, and saying that they left us with a hopeless situation. President Rouhani has given us words and more words, comforting thoughts and promises. But the real question is - what comes next after that? Reforms are on hold, it seems. Runaway inflation persists, as do outrageous hikes in rental prices. Mr Rouhani is carrying high hopes from Washington. But can he deliver? There is a long trek ahead, and he's going at a snail's pace so far. He is also recruiting heavily from the expediency council - which is mostly made up of retirees and is seen as a cushy number. They also have no clout. So, there is a lot more that needs to be done. I'm satisfied with Mr Rouhani's performance so far because I know he has to struggle every day with the troubles forced upon him by extremists. I don't expect him to perform miracles immediately. I'm satisfied with the changes he has made in government, such as selecting ministers. The judiciary system, which is almost always responsible for cruelty and injustice in Iran, is not controlled by the president, but rather the Supreme Leader, so there's not much he can change there. Our freedom has surely improved, while the economic conditions haven't got any better because our economic situation, mainly at this point, depends on our foreign policy and imposed economic sanctions on Iran. Mr Rouhani does consider our national interests and the most important job he must do, in my opinion, is establishing a good relationship between Iran and America and other Western countries. There have been no surprises in these 100 days. Rouhani is nothing but a puppet chosen by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Nothing has changed. In fact, things are now worse. There is more unemployment, more hunger and inflation is at 45 per cent. My young unemployed friends sleep hungry at night hoping they don't wake up. The regime is not only fooling the Iranian people, but is also fooling the international community. There have been no reforms. The regime is executing political prisoners on a daily basis. Standards of living or freedoms have only improved for the elite and the regime. I am pleased to say that the economic situation in our country has improved. I hope that it will now be allowed to flourish in the near future. To achieve this, we will need to strengthen our relationship with Western countries. I think President Rouhani should concentrate on solving our problems with the US, because we have the potential to be the most powerful country in the Middle East. In addition, it's worth mentioning some of the changes he has tried to make, like his attempt to release some political prisoners from jail and allowing the media to express their views about current issues more freely.

      <description>A group of leading UK aid charities launches an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon Haiyan.</description>

      <body>UK aid charities have launched an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) said it was already responding but there was still a desperate need for water, food and emergency shelter. It will make a televised appeal on Tuesday evening. Earlier David Cameron announced an increase in UK aid. Typhoon Haiyan is feared to have killed up to 10,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The DEC, a group of 14 leading UK aid organisations, said the relief effort was being severely hampered by roads made impassable and airports closed by the typhoon. "The destruction in Tacloban city, on the east coast, is said to be reminiscent of the Boxing Day tsunami," the committee's chief executive Saleh Saeed said. "There is currently no food, water or electricity. We can only imagine how much worse the situation will be for families living in towns and remote villages. "DEC members are doing all they can to get aid through but they need a huge injection of funds in order to do so. The priorities are getting food, water and shelter to people in desperate need." UK broadcasters the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, Channel 5 and other outlets will show the appeal following early evening news programmes. The DEC comprises the charities Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said there was a danger that if enough aid was not delivered quickly it would be pregnant women and children who missed out. "All the organisations - Save the Children, Oxfam, all the others, the United Nations - are there ready to help," he said. "We need to land the planes, we need to offload them and then we need to get aid to people." Meanwhile the UK government said it was increasing its aid to the country from £6m to £10m. The money will pay for aid flights to Cebu in the east of the country, the delivery of temporary shelters, blankets and water purification tablets and sanitation equipment for 300k people. Mr Cameron has also announced that the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Darling will soon head to the disaster zone from Singapore. It would take five days to arrive but once in the Philippines brings engineering and first aid expertise as well as the use of a Lynx helicopter. The ship also carries equipment to make drinking water from sea water. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu. Among other states to have pledged aid are Australia, Aus$9m (£5.8m) and New Zealand, NZ$2.15m (£1.1m). China, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, the US, Vietnam, European Commission and the UN have also announced support. The aid effort comes after a state of "national calamity" was announced by Philippines President Benigno Aquino. On Friday one of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Reports on Monday said 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected - with many now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. </body>

      <title>Davey: Energy users 'not cash cows'</title>
      <description>Gas and electricity customers should not be "cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say.</description>

      <body>Gas and electricity customers are "not just cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say. In a speech later, the Liberal Democrat minister will call on the industry to "open up your books" to show how it is trying to minimise tariffs. Millions of customers face price rises for gas and electricity this winter. But industry body Energy UK complained that a "tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults" was developing. Four of the UK's six main energy companies have recently announced price rises, with an average increase of 9.1%, and the other two are expected to follow suit soon. The firms say the rises are largely due to increasing wholesale prices, but critics say they are unfair and will lead households into difficulties with bills. In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. He has accused the coalition of doing too little to help keep tariffs down. But the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In his speech to the annual conference of Energy UK, which represents the industry, in London on Tuesday, Mr Davey will argue that companies need to make enough money to invest in greener technologies. He will add: "But those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. "Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. "It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up." Mr Davey will say: "Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks." He will tell companies: "You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public - and the public must have trust in what you do." Mr Davey will say the government is looking at how to reduce the impact of its policies on bills, adding: "But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible." He will also tell industry leaders they face a "Fred the Shred" moment, in reference to the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood after leading the bank to near-collapse in 2008. But Labour's shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said: "David Cameron's out-of-touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis." "Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. "It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say." Energy UK, meanwhile, said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. "The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. "As analysis from UBS shows, about 95% of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs." </body>

      <body>New mothers are to be offered up to £200 in shopping vouchers to encourage them to breastfeed their babies. The pilot scheme is being targeted at deprived areas of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire and funded through a collaboration between government and the medical research sector. A third area is expected soon with the plan to trial it on 130 women who have babies from now until March. If it proves successful, a nationwide pilot could be rolled out next year. The use of financial incentives is not new in the NHS. It has been tried before to encourage people to quit smoking as well as lose weight. But this is the first time it has been tried on such a scale for breastfeeding. Under the scheme mothers from specific parts of Sheffield and Chesterfield will be offered the vouchers, which they can then use in supermarkets and high street shops. The areas have been chosen because they have such low breastfeeding rates. On average just one in four mothers are breastfeeding by the six- to eight-week mark compared with a national average of 55%. To qualify for the full £200 of rewards, the women will have to breastfeed until six months. However, it will be frontloaded enabling those taking part to get £120 for breastfeeding for the first six weeks. Midwives and health visitors will be asked to verify whether the women are breastfeeding. The team behind the project said breastfeeding was a cause of health inequalities, pointing to research that showed it helped prevent health problems such as upset stomachs and chest infections as well as leading to better educational attainment. Dr Clare Relton, the Sheffield University expert leading the project, said she hoped the financial incentives would create a culture where breastfeeding was seen as the norm. "It is a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies, mothers and society," she added. But Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives, questioned the initiative. "The motive for breastfeeding cannot be rooted by offering financial reward. It has to be something that a mother wants to do in the interest of the health and well-being of her child." She said the answer lay in making sure there were enough staff available to provide comprehensive support to new mothers after birth. </body>

      <title>'Soaring demand' for homes says Rics</title>
      <description>Chartered surveyors are calling for urgent action to cope with "soaring demand" from house buyers.</description>

      <body>Chartered surveyors have called for urgent action to cope with "soaring demand" from house buyers. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), also indicated that not enough houses are coming on to the market. Rics said that "rocketing interest" from potential buyers was "dwarfing" the number of properties for sale. In the meantime, official figures out later are expected to show UK house prices hitting another record high. The comments from Rics accompanied the results of its latest monthly survey of its members. It measured the opinion of 300 chartered surveyors across the country. In October those reporting price rises outnumbered those reporting no rises by the highest margin since 2002. The government's Help to Buy scheme is one reason for that, said Rics. But it warned that a lack of houses being put up for sale is proving problematic. "The amount of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand," said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist of Rics. "In order for the market to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed." he said. By contrast, the survey shows declining interest from people wanting to rent accommodation. The proportion of surveyors reporting a rise in interest from potential tenants was at its lowest for a decade. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) out later are expected to show UK house prices at a new record high. Last month the ONS reported that prices across the country are higher than at any time since the survey began in 1968. It said prices were rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but were falling in Scotland. However, the Land Registry has reported that the average house price in England and Wales is £167,063, which is still 8% below its peak in November 2007. </body>

      <title>MP Dorries apologises over TV fees</title>
      <description>Tory MP Nadine Dorries apologises for failing to properly register income she made from her appearance on I'm A Celebrity.</description>

      <body>Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has apologised to MPs for failing to properly register income made from her appearance on I'm A Celebrity in 2012. Ms Dorries said the breach of the rules had been "inadvertent" but she owed MPs a "full and unreserved apology". She cited a confidentiality clause and the fact the fees were paid to a firm of which she was a shareholder for not declaring the outside earnings. But the standards committee said she must apologise. The standards commissioner also criticised the MP for Mid-Bedfordshire for not co-operating with their inquiry, saying this amounted to a "serious breach" of the MPs' code of conduct. However, it said it believed that the MP's failure to register her financial interest as a shareholder in the Averbrook media consultancy until June 2013 was "inadvertent" rather than deliberate. The standards committee of MPs, which has the power to sanction members in light of the commissioner's findings, said the MP should make a "personal statement" to the House to apologise. The MP lost the Conservative whip when she appeared on I'm A Celebrity in 2012 but Ms Dorries said she succeeded in communicating her views to a wider audience and her constituents had continued to be represented while she was in Australia, where the show is filmed. The issue of Ms Dorries' income from TV appearances, including the ITV show, was referred to the watchdog earlier this year following a complaint by Labour MP John Mann. The watchdog found she had not recorded details of eight separate media appearances on six different programmes in the register of MPs financial interests. If the MP had been paid for any of these appearances, the watchdog said it would represent a breach of the rules - requiring MPs to disclose time spent on their outside employment and the amount of money they make. "The omissions from Ms Dorries' entry means that constituents, other members and the wider public do not have access to this information in her case," the commissioner said. "The omissions also have the potential to undermine public confidence in the completeness and accuracy of the register." In a letter to the committee last month, the MP said she "unequivocally never sought to impede" the inquiry in any way. "In respect of both the code and guidance there is unfortunately an ambiguity, which fails to make clear to members their responsibilities in terms of the declaration of outside interests and contractual obligations," she added. Ms Dorries updated her entry on the register in October. It showed Averbrook's turnover for the previous year was £142,000, yielding a profit of £82,000. It also showed Ms Dorries took a £10,000 dividend at the end of the month. Ms Dorries told the standards committee that if she disclosed how much she had been paid by ITV she would "fall foul" of the contract's confidentiality clause but the MPs said requirements to provide information to Parliament "overrode" confidentiality agreements. The MPs said the disciplinary system in the Commons "depended on members being prepared to explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary, to respond to the commissioner's inquiries". "We recommend that Ms Dorries register all payments in respect of her employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook or any other third party and apologise to the House by way of a personal statement." It also said the MP should seek advice from officials about her entries in the register before the end of the month and her future compliance with the rules would be monitored. The MP had the whip restored in May and was recently re-adopted as the Conservative candidate to fight the next general election in her constituency. </body>

      <title>Gove urges child protection reform</title>
      <description>A systematic and radical reform of the child protection system in England is needed, says Michael Gove.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove is calling for "systematic" and "radical" reform of England's child protection system so it can meet the challenge it faces. The Education Secretary, who was himself adopted, says his life was "transformed" by the skill of social workers, and his adoptive parents. Many social workers were indoctrinated, however, to see the people they help as victims of social injustice, he says. This was pernicious and led to excuses being made for poor behaviour, he adds. Speaking at an NSPCC event, Mr Gove, who has responsibility for children's services as well as education, will say: "I believe that we have not been either systematic, radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country. "But that is changing. And it is my aim to ensure that change is equal to the challenge we all face." He said social workers needed to be skilful in developing relationships with adults and thinking about the needs of their children at the same time. He will go on to argue that great practice is being "undermined by dogma" and that he intends to "strip this out" of social work by reforming its structures and improving standards. "Social work training involves idealistic students being told that the individuals with whom they will work have been disempowered by society," he is expected to say. "They will be encouraged to see these individuals as victims of social injustice whose fate is overwhelmingly decreed by the economic forces and inherent inequalities which scar our society," he will add. "This analysis is, sadly as widespread as it is pernicious. It robs individuals of the power of agency and breaks the link between an individual's actions and the consequences. It risks explaining away substance abuse, domestic violence and personal irresponsibility, rather than doing away with them." It could lead social workers "to see their job as securing the family's access to services provided", rather than "helping them to change their own approach to life". "Instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour, and improve their own lives, some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices," he will say. The speech comes as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill in the Lords is set to make it more straightforward for the secretary of state to intervene in failing local authorities. Some were already doing so, such as Kensington and Chelsea and Richmond, the Department for Education said, and this was bringing benefits. There is one local authority children's services, Doncaster, which has been completely taken out of council control. A private consultancy firm has been chosen to run the troubled department wholesale. But the DfE is said to be eyeing a number of other children's services departments which are thought to not be performing as well as they should. </body>

      <title>'Hidden workforce crisis' in nursing</title>
      <description>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, says the Royal College of Nursing.</description>

      <body>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, a nursing union is warning. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) says there are nearly 20,000 unfilled posts in England. And it says more than a fifth of trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad. The government says staffing levels have improved - there are now over 1,350 more qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors than a year ago. The RCN sent requests under the Freedom of Information Act to all acute, mental health and community NHS trusts in England as part of its three-year-old Frontline First campaign against job cuts. Some 61 organisations replied - representing a response rate of 24%. The trusts who responded had an average vacancy rate of 6% - though in some trusts this was as high as 16%. The union believes this constitutes "a hidden workforce crisis". The RCN asked for the data because the government stopped collecting it in 2011. The last available figures showed a vacancy rate of 2.5%. More trusts - 140 - answered questions about overseas recruitment. These replies showed 22% were recruiting nurses from abroad, while a further 9% were considering the possibility. Earlier this year an inquiry highlighted the "appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people" at Stafford Hospital in Staffordshire. The Francis report found systemic failures that went right to the top of the NHS in England. On Tuesday the RCN's head of policy, Howard Catton, said: "In recent months we've seen the 'Francis effect' after the report into Stafford Hospital, with some trusts unfreezing posts that were vacant. "But when they've gone to the market to try to recruit staff, they've found it difficult. This is because there's been a cut in the number of nursing student places. "And overseas recruitment is more difficult, because there's a shortage of many thousands of nurses across the EU." Official figures show 5,870 nursing posts have been lost in England since 2010. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: "Unsafe staffing levels have been implicated in a number of high profile investigations into patient safety. "We call on employers in the NHS to put an end to boom-and-bust workforce planning and develop clear standards to ensure safe staffing levels are met, supported by robust inspection based on reliable data." Health Minister Norman Lamb said: "Nursing leaders have been clear that hospitals should publish staffing details and the evidence to show the numbers are right for the services they deliver. "Patient-safety experts agree that safe staff-patient ratios should be set locally. "We will be announcing more on our plans to guide staffing decisions in our full response to the Francis report later this autumn. "Overall, the number of clinical staff in the NHS has increased by nearly 4,100 and the number of admin staff has fallen by 22,800. "The chief inspector of hospitals will be able to take action if trusts are found to be compromising patient care by not having the right number of staff on wards." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "David Cameron is making matters worse. We should be bringing on the next generation of British nurses, but he's cutting trainee nurse posts whilst wasting money on overseas recruitment." The organisation NHS Employers said the figures needed to be seen in the context of the 347,000 qualified nurses working in the NHS every day. Every month the NHS recruits around 10,000 staff through natural turnover, it said. </body>

      <title>Call for terror relocation powers</title>
      <description>The home secretary should get back the power to forcibly relocate terror suspects to different parts of the country, Labour argues.</description>

      <body>The home secretary should be able to relocate terror suspects to another part of the country, Labour says. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for the powers to be brought back after a man under a government order restricting his movements absconded disguised in a burka last week and has not been seen since. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure (TPim). Labour say TPims watered down controls. It has been reported that the government is reviewing the measures which were introduced last year and replaced the much more restrictive control orders. Ms Cooper has written to Theresa May, urging her to re-introduce previously available powers to forcibly move suspects around the country. She said Ms May could face allegations of a U-turn but pledged to support the government "on a cross-party basis" if it brought back the relocation powers. Mr Mohamed, allegedly linked to Somali militant group al-Shabab, disappeared from a west London mosque last week. He had been relocated to Ipswich when subject to a control order but moved back to London when the restriction was lifted. This followed the case of Ibrahim Magag - also under a TPim - who went on the run last Boxing Day. "No terror suspect under a relocation order ever managed to abscond," Ms Cooper wrote to the home secretary. "Now two terror suspects who were previously relocated and then returned because of your decision have absconded. "Your decision, against advice and warnings, to end relocations has made it much easier for two dangerous men to disappear." Labour made the call as MPs prepare to question independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson QC and Charles Farr, director general for security and counter-terrorism. Ahead of the home affairs select committee meeting on Tuesday the party urged Ms May to apologise for "increasing the risk to public safety". "Will you now accept that the decision to end relocations was a very serious error of judgement and has led directly to two out of the ten terror suspects on TPims now absconding?" Ms Cooper wrote. Missing Mr Mohamed, 27, was already facing 20 charges for allegedly breaching the conditions of a TPim and of an earlier control order. </body>

      <title>Biodiversity plans 'too simplistic'</title>
      <description>The government's biodiversity offsetting plans are too simplistic and need to be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs warn.</description>

      <body>Biodiversity offsetting plans outlined by the government must be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs have warned. The scheme aims to ensure that when a development causes unavoidable damage to biodiversity, "new, bigger or better nature sites will be created". But the MPs say the assessment proposed by ministers appears to be little more than a "box-ticking exercise". Six areas are taking part in a two-year pilot, which began in April 2012. Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) chairwoman Joan Walley MP said many witnesses that gave evidence to the EAC's inquiry had voiced concerns that key habitats - such as ancient woodlands and Sites of Special Scientific Interest - would be included in the government's offsetting plans. 'Not adequate' "There is a danger that an overly simplistic offsetting system would not protect these long-established ecosystems," she added. "Biodiversity offsetting could improve the way our planning system accounts for the damage developments do to wildlife, if it is done well. "The assessment process currently proposed by the government appears to be little more than a 20-minute box-ticking exercise that is simply not adequate to assess a site's year-round biodiversity. Ms Walley explained: "If a 20-minute assessment was carried out in a British wood in winter, for instance, it would be easy to overlook many of the migratory birds that may use it as habitat in summer." However, in their report, the MPs acknowledged that it was "too soon to reach a decision" on offsetting while the pilot schemes had yet to be completed and independently evaluated. But they added that they were publishing their report now as ministers were considering submissions made during a public consultation on the proposals. The consultation on how the scheme would be rolled-out across England closed last week and officials are now considering the submissions. Responding to the EAC's findings, National Trust natural environment director Simon Pryor said the MPs' report showed that the government had to take its time to ensure to get the scheme right. "Offsetting could be a positive way to help avoid the loss of wildlife that can result from development - but only if it is done properly," he observed. "If a system is introduced too rapidly, and without adequate testing and evidence, the prospect of a workable and supportable biodiversity offsetting system would be undermined for many years to come." In its consultation document, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said that England faced "the twin challenges of growing its economy and improving its natural environment", adding: "We will not achieve these goals unless our planning system is fit-for-purpose." A Defra spokesman told BBC News: "Biodiversity offsetting could help improve our environment as well as boost the economy. "This report, along with other consultation responses, will help us get the detail of the policy right," he explained. "We will formally respond to the report in due course." A number of reports, produced by the Ecosystem Markets Task Force and the Natural Capital Committee, had identified biodiversity offsetting as a way of delivering a sustainable planning system. However, an independent review of England's wildlife sites, led by Prof Sir John Lawton, concluded in September 2010 that biodiversity offsetting must not become a "licence to destroy" or damage existing habitat of recognised value. "In other words, offsets must only be used to compensate for genuinely unavoidable damage," the review recommended. Defra said that offsetting schemes had been adopted in more than 20 countries, including Australia, Germany, India and the US, as a means of protecting biodiversity. Ms Walley also observed that the pilot schemes, which are scheduled to run until April 2014, had "not had a good take-up". "That suggests that these sorts of schemes need to be mandatory, but the government should exercise some caution about this because the pilots need to be rigorously and independently assessed first to make sure all the lesson are properly taken on board". </body>

      <title>Heseltine: HS2 is 'an act of faith'</title>
      <description>Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine is due to come out strongly in favour of the HS2 north-south rail project.</description>

      <body>The UK should have faith in the £50bn HS2 rail project, a senior Tory and former deputy prime minister will urge. Lord Heseltine is to warn that future generations would judge those in power today harshly if they failed to deliver the new north-south line. He will call for the project to be "accelerated" and say the private sector should bear more of the costs. Ministers argue HS2 will boost the UK's economic prospects and slash journey times to and from London. But the senior Conservative is expected to say in a speech later that the project is about more than that. "HS2 is about our country's competitiveness for a half century or more. "It is about so many more people sharing growth that has, for too long, been concentrated on London and the south east." Lord Heseltine, author of a report on economic growth for the government, will cast doubt on some of the cost-benefit analyses carried out so far for the project. In a speech to the Royal Town Planning Institute, he is due to say: "Let me leave the ladies and gentlemen of the slide rules. They know no more and no less than you and me." He will say that no-one is "asking what might happen" but, referring to his period in charge of regeneration in under Margaret Thatcher, is expected to add: "I tell you frankly, I don't know either. I didn't know in east London in 1979 but I believed. "All over the world governments are making decisions about a future which they cannot predict but in which they believe." A recent report by KPMG suggested the new line could be worth £15bn to the UK economy - with Greater London and the West Midlands the biggest beneficiaries. The accountants behind the report and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin are due to appear before MPs to defend their economic justifications for the railway. Lord Heseltine will tell his audience costs must be kept down but that not going ahead presented risks for the UK. "The cost of dither, doubt and delay. The cost of standing still while our competitors move ahead. "If we hadn't built Canary Wharf, how many of the jobs there would be in Frankfurt instead?" he will ask. But he will add that Sir David Higgins, incoming chairman of the HS2 Ltd company, "should consult appropriate institutions about the financing of the project in part during construction in order to ensure their participation in the long term concession". HS2 has commanded cross-party support from its inception but Labour appeared to change its tone recently, saying it would not give the project a "blank cheque". However Lord Heseltine will warn sceptics: "Not many of those in power to make decisions will be around to judge the world of the HS2 but others of younger generations will judge us." </body>

      <body>A mother who had post-natal depression when she killed her baby daughter in a "sudden explosion of violence" is to be sentenced later. Five-week-old Amelia Lilly Sultan-Curtis died in hospital from a single blow to the head on 8 October 2012. Her 21-year-old mother Natasha Sultan was due to stand trial for murder. She will be sentenced at Hull Crown Court on the lesser charge of infanticide. The judge said the balance of mind had been disturbed. Sultan, Welton Grove, Hull, admitted infanticide on the first day of her trial - a plea accepted by the prosecution. Tim Roberts QC, for the prosecution, told the court Sultan had changed her story several times, at first denying any knowledge of injury to her child. Later she claimed to have dropped the child accidentally before eventually admitting that she caused the fatal fracture to the skull. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told her: "I cannot, and will not, ignore the fact you killed your baby...in a sudden explosion of violence. "It is an anxious and difficult case in equal measure. "The facts are clear - you killed your much-loved and wanted child when the balance of your mind was disturbed." Psychiatric reports showed she had been suffering from post-natal depression at the time of the killing. </body>

      <description>Expenses policy for Norfolk's PCC is to reviewed after incumbent Stephen Bett agreed to repay £3,000 claimed for trips between his official HQ and home.</description>

      <body>Expenses policy for Norfolk's Police and Crime Commissioner is to be reviewed after a decision by incumbent Stephen Bett to repay £3,000 for travel between his official HQ and home. Mr Bett voluntarily decided to repay the money after the BBC revealed he had claimed for 70 trips from his home to the offices in Wymondham. PCC chief executive Mark Stokes is to carry out the review. Mr Bett is due to repay the £3,000 on 28 November. In response to questions from the BBC it was also revealed that Mr Bett had claimed £14.40 in mileage for attending the funeral of a Police Community Support Officer and a country council employee who worked in the "community safety field". The office for the commissioner said he was representing the department in attending the funeral. A spokesman for the commissioner said: "The new chief executive (who started on 21 October) is undertaking a full review of the office policies around expenses claims and the way this is presented on our website. "However as the PCC said on Friday he will pay back any money claimed for travelling from his office (at home address) to Wymondham and will not claim for those journeys again." Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and economist, told the BBC last week the claims were not tax-allowable. The PCC's spokesman said their website was under review with the aim of making information on expenses and other matters "more easily accessible". Mr Bett, a former Conservative county councillor and Norfolk Police Authority chairman, was elected as independent PCC a year ago on an annual salary of £70,000. On taking up the post, he designated his home near Hunstanton as his workplace and claimed mileage expenses when travelling from there on PCC business. From November 2012 to August 2013, he claimed a total of £4,947.75 in mileage expenses. Of that, £3,024 was for the 96-mile round trip from his home to the headquarters in Wymondham. Speaking last week, Mr Bett said: "I want to make it categorically clear that I believe everything I have done since taking office regarding my expenses has been above board." </body>

      <body>An MSP whose daughter died from anorexia has called on retailers to use larger sized fashion mannequins to help tackle eating disorders. Debenhams announced last week it would introduce a size 16 dummy to reflect the size of many of its customers. SNP MSP Dennis Robertson will use his Member's Debate to urge other fashion outlets to do the same. He has campaigned on the issue since his 18-year-old daughter Caroline died in 2011. Shop mannequins are usually a size eight or 10. Speaking ahead of the Eating Disorders and the Fashion Industry debate, Mr Robertson said thin mannequins reinforced an unrealistic ideal of body shape and size. The member for Aberdeenshire West added: "Debenhams, through their flagship store in London, are leading the way in the UK on different size mannequins and their summer catalogue also made a display of the diversity in our society. "It is important to celebrate that diversity because young people can be influenced by what they see in shop windows, magazines or adverts and I hope that many more fashion retailers can follow in their footsteps. "I do not feel the sole responsibility lies with medical professionals to tackle the issue of eating disorders, and the media and fashion industry must show some action to ensure that young people especially have positive images of the diverse body shapes and sizes in our society." Equality minister Jo Swinson said last week that the decision by Debenhams to introduce a plus-size mannequin went some way towards tackling the "important" issue of body-confidence that affects some women. </body>

      <body>Veteran TV broadcaster David Dimbleby has revealed he has got his first tattoo - a scorpion on his shoulder. In a Radio Times interview, the 75-year-old Question Time host said: "You are only old once. I have always wanted a tattoo. "I thought I might as well have it done now. It's a dream come true for me," he added. Dimbleby got the tattoo while making the maritime series, Britain and the Sea, due to be aired later this month. During filming, Dimbleby was given the chance to have a tattoo of his own while looking into how body art was introduced to the UK as a result of Captain Cook's South Sea adventures. He turned down the offer and had a black pencil mark put on his body, but changed his mind when he saw a preview of the film. "I thought it was wimpish having it just drawn on and I needed to man up," he said. Dimbleby, who has been the BBC's main presenter of election coverage since 1979, was then accompanied to an east London tattoo studio by a cameraman. "It took about 30 minutes - an hour in all - and I thought of Winston Churchill having his done while mine was being done. It wasn't painful at all, it just zings a bit." The tattoo, on his right shoulder, was discreet, modest and represented his star sign, Scorpio, he said. Of singer Cheryl Cole, who has roses tattooed all over her bottom, he said: "I wasn't tempted to have any private parts decorated, I have to tell you." His wife, Belinda, was, he added, "mildly amused" by it but might be persuaded to have one of her own. </body>

      <body>Plans to raise the height of an iconic statue in Glasgow - in a bid to stop revellers placing traffic cones on it - are 'likely to be withdrawn'. Glasgow City Council wanted to raise the plinth as part of a £65,000 project to refurbish the Duke of Wellington monument in the centre of the city. However, after a massive social media campaign, a council spokesman said the plan was likely to be dropped. He said an announcement would be made on Tuesday. The council had said that raising the height would end a practice which projected a "depressing image" of Glasgow and would save the £10,000 cost of removing the cone 100 times a year. The scheme would have seen a new granite-clad concrete base of 86cm (34in) added to the memorial to raise its overall height. However, the council has reconsidered its decision "in its current form" after an online petition called "Save Wellington's Cone", which gathered thousands of signatories in just a few hours, and a Facebook campaign which had planned a rally in support of the cone. The petition stated: "The cone on Wellington's head is an iconic part of Glasgow's heritage, and means far more to the people of Glasgow and to visitors than Wellington himself ever has. "Raising the statue will, in any case, only result in people injuring themselves attempting to put the cone on anyway: does anyone really think that a raised plinth will deter drunk Glaswegians?" The matter was discussed widely on social networking sites. Writer and comedian Greg Hemphill wrote on his Twitter feed: "Raising the statue is a very sound idea cause if there's one thing every Glaswegian loves it's being told what they can and cannot do." Adapting a former catchphrase from his Chewin' The Fat show, he added: "Cony No Dae That." The Wellington statue was sculpted by Italian artist Carlo Marochetti and erected in 1844. </body>

      <title>NI children aged 12 'can use guns'</title>
      <description>Northern Ireland gun laws are to change to allow children as young as 12 years old supervised access to firearms.</description>

      <body>Northern Ireland gun laws are to change to allow children as young as 12 years old to use firearms. Justice Minister David Ford has decided that the age at which a young person may have supervised access to air guns or shotguns will drop by four years. At present, firearms certificates may be issued to 16 to 18-year-olds in specific cases for use on farms. Mr Ford's decision follows public consultation and discussion with Chief Constable Matt Baggott. Two organisations for shooting have called for the age to be lowered to 10 years old. In February, the Northern Ireland Firearms Dealers and Shooters Association and the British Association for Shooting and Conservation told the Northern Ireland Justice Committee that they favoured the lower age. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Department of Justice said: "Following public consultation and having considered the view of the chief constable, Justice Minister David Ford has decided that the age at which a young person may have supervised access to air guns or shotguns will be reduced to 12 years of age. "This will require further consideration of the detail to ensure appropriate supervision by a suitably experienced adult." Stewart Dickson, Alliance, a member of Stormont's justice committee, said he felt "nervous" about the move but would not be challenging the justice minister. "I think that the arguments have been put to the committee by the various gun organisations," he said. "Use by 12 years olds would be in extremely supervised circumstances, those are the assurances we have received." Mr Dickson said the argument was that in competitive sport, such as the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games, would-be competitors from Northern Ireland were not starting at a young age and could not get to the levels required. "I do have concerns for the safety of children and I am concerned that any change in the gun laws is exceptionally well managed," he said. Mr Dickson said he would challenge anyone who sought to bring the age below 12 years. It is understood that, under the changes in the law, children as young as 12 would be able to use firearms provided they were supervised by an adult aged over 21 with at least three years' experience in firearms working in a controlled environment such as a gun club. </body>

      <title>Former SDLP MP Eddie McGrady dies</title>
      <description>The former SDLP MP for South Down Eddie McGrady has died at the age of 78.</description>

      <body>The former SDLP MP for South Down, Eddie McGrady, has died. Mr McGrady, who was 78 and had been ill for some time, was an MP from 1987 until his retirement in 2010. He was a founding member of the SDLP. SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said Mr McGrady's politics "were the politics of fair play, of social justice, reconciliation and general decency". He said there was "not a sectarian bone in his body". One of 11 children, Mr McGrady was born in Market Street in Downpatrick, County Down, where his father ran a clothing shop. A former chartered accountant, he sat on Downpatrick Urban council in the 1960s and early 1970s, and then on Down District Council until 1989. He was also a member of the Northern Ireland assemblies in existence in the 1970s and 1980s, and a member of the current assembly between 1998 and 2003. Mr McGrady gained national prominence on election night in 1987, when - at his fourth attempt - he defeated Enoch Powell, who had been Ulster Unionist MP for South Down since 1974. As an MP he was known as an opponent of the Sellafield nuclear plant and a defender of the Downe Hospital. Dr McDonnell said he was deeply saddened by his death. "Today, the SDLP has lost one of its founding pillars. County Down has lost a great champion and Ireland has lost a person of faith and integrity who enhanced public life in a political career that lasted almost half a century," he said. "As a founding member of the SDLP, Eddie helped to shape not only our party, but history, as he along with John Hume, Seamus Mallon and others helped to define the politics of an era and build the peace of our lifetime." Mr Hume said he was "extremely sad to learn of the death of my dear friend". He added: "Eddie was a man of deep faith, incredible fortitude and considerable courage. He brought a sharp political instinct to all his work, displaying both talent and tenacity throughout a distinguished career stretching 50 years in public service. "Eddie served the constituency of South Down, which he loved, with distinction, but above all Eddie was a family man happiest at his home in Saul in Downpatrick." Former SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie, who succeeded Mr McGrady as South Down MP, said: "Eddie was not only my mentor and colleague but a very dear friend. "Eddie was an inspiration to a generation of politicians and a true advocate for the community of South Down." UUP leader Mike Nesbitt paid tribute to "a popular politician whose appeal crossed the traditional divide". He said: "Eddie McGrady, Seamus Mallon and John Hume were a formidable team at a time when Northern Ireland needed strong leadership from both communities speaking out loudly against violence. "Eddie, of course, was a political opponent who took a Westminster seat off us, winning South Down at the fourth attempt in 1987. "Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues in the SDLP." Sinn Féin South Down MLA, Caitriona Ruane, said she was saddened to hear of Mr McGrady's death. Ms Ruane said: "Eddie always treated me with kindness and respect and I would like to acknowledge his work for all the people of south Down." DUP South Down MLA Jim Wells described Mr McGrady as "a true gentleman". He added: "He was a tireless campaigner for the people of south Down and his passing will be felt by people from right across the community. "I stood against Eddie in a number of elections and results demonstrated his popularity within the constituency." Alliance leader David Ford said: "As a councillor, MLA and then MP for South Down, Mr McGrady worked hard for all his constituents. His tireless work went a great way to calming tensions in the area, helping create the more stable, peaceful Northern Ireland we have all experienced in recent years. "His contribution to Northern Ireland politics has been great, both as a campaigner for peace and the desire to make a difference to the lives of those he represented." Secretary of State Theresa Villiers said Mr McGrady would be "sadly missed", and added: "He was a staunch advocate of constitutional politics and was an instrumental figure in the negotiations that ultimately led to the Belfast Agreement in 1998. "He reflected that the Agreement was one of the high points of his time in politics. He was widely regarded as a man of real decency and commitment to the public good." Ivan Lewis, the shadow secretary of state, said: "Eddie McGrady was a tireless campaigner for social justice and peace in Northern Ireland. His beliefs and political leadership played a crucial role in helping to lay the foundations for the peace process. "He was a great colleague and friend of many in the Labour Party and will be greatly missed by all who knew him." Mr McGrady's wife of more than 20 years, Patricia, passed away in 2003. They are survived by their three children - Paula, Jerry and Conaill. </body>

      <title>'Frustration' as measles cases grow</title>
      <description>A senior doctor speaks of his frustration with a second crop of measles cases in south Wales, just months after a large outbreak ended.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-24899459</url>

      <body>A senior doctor has spoken of his frustration with a second crop of measles cases in south Wales just months after a large outbreak ended. Dr Jorg Hoffman from Public Health Wales spoke as a report into the eight-month outbreak is due to be released. From last November to June there were over 1,200 suspected cases of measles reported in south, west and mid Wales, and one man died as a result. A new outbreak starting at a Neath school last month has led to 36 cases. Updated figures for the latest outbreak will be published later. Dr Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health Wales (PHW), said the new outbreak was a result of the virus being re-imported into the Swansea area from outside Wales. He told BBC News that cases were being reported on a daily basis. "It's very frustrating. Numerous times we wrote to every GP, to schools, and said 'we're still seeing measles, you must check your child's vaccination status' and get them vaccinated if uncertain or if they know they have not had it," he said. Vaccinations with the MMR triple jab dipped sharply in the Swansea area following a now discredited report in the late 1990s wrongly linking the vaccine to cases of autism. Dr Hoffmann said there had been 35,000 extra vaccinations in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg (ABM) University Health Board area during the last outbreak but added there were still children unprotected in the 10-18 age group who did not have their MMR jabs as toddlers. In the ABM area, 95% of teenagers had had at least one dose of MMR, while 90% had had both. Dr Hoffman stressed that of those who had only had one dose, 10% would remain vulnerable to measles. He said people who had had the first jab during the outbreak had sometimes not come back for the second. "I think it's human nature that once the threat is gone they move on," he added. As yet, scientists have not been able to establish where the first case of the current outbreak came from. Last year's outbreak was traced to a holiday camp in England. "The virus is endemic in England, Europe and other parts of the world and some people will bring it back from there," said Dr Hoffman. He explained that with 30,000 10-18-year-olds across Wales still unprotected, there was potential for the number of measles cases to rise, although he added he did not think it was as likely to grow to the extent of the previous outbreak. "We're trying very, very hard to contain this. We do not want a repeat." He said parents of those affected had been advised to stay away from children's centres and sporting events while their children were infectious. "The majority of people are very good at complying, but a proportion are not," he said. Dr Ian Millington, a Swansea GP for 40 years and secretary of the local medical committee representing doctors to the health board, said the new outbreak was "very worrying". He was concerned that many people were still resistant to the vaccination message. "I think some is complacency, some ignorance and some is 'it isn't in my face'," he said. "We're getting into a hard core of people who don't believe in vaccinations or are burying their heads in the sand." Dr Millington thought appealing directly to the teenagers who had missed out on vaccinations because of their parents' view could work. "This is another way forward in the hope that they will see they are exposed to a high risk of a nasty disease." </body>

      <title>Small firm lending set for criticism</title>
      <description>Lending to small businesses by an arm of the Welsh government is set to be criticised in an independent report published later.</description>

      <body>Lending to small businesses by an arm of the Welsh government is set to be criticised in an independent report. The second part of a two-stage review, it is expected to question the performance of Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment company. The first part of the review by Prof Dylan Jones-Evans said there "remains confusion" about its exact role. Plaid Cymru has reiterated its call for the establishment of a new publicly-owned development bank. Commissioned by Economy Minister Edwina Hart, the Access to Finance Review was set-up following concern that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing difficulties borrowing money from banks. It has been led by Prof Dylan Jones-Evans, a business expert at the University of the West of England and a former Conservative assembly candidate. Published in June 2013, the first part of the report said decisions on bank lending should be solely made in Wales. It also concluded that 20,000 SMEs in Wales are missing out on the funding they require from banks. There are an estimated 210,700 enterprises active in Wales in 2012, 99% of which are SMEs. Prof Jones-Evans's initial report called on the Welsh government to clarify the role of its investment arm Finance Wales. The report also highlighted business concerns that Finance Wales' interest rates and additional costs were "punitive, especially within an environment where the Bank of England base interest rate has been at its lowest level in history". Finance Wales has justified the interest rate levels as a requirement of EU state aid guidelines. In October the first minister announced that SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales. The second part of Prof Jones-Evans' report, which will be published following a statement by the economy minister in the Senedd on Tuesday, is expected to raise further concerns with the funding agency. Ahead of the report's publication, Plaid Cymru repeated its calls to establish a new publicly-owned, not-for-profit bank to lend money to small businesses. Economy spokesperson Alun Ffred Jones said: "We need a new body, owned by the public but at arm's length from government to lend money to small businesses at competitive rates. "Securing cash flow for businesses, particularly for small businesses is key in creating employment and keeping the wheels of the economy moving. "It is vital that our SMEs are able to access the resources they need in order to operate effectively and to prosper so that the Welsh economy can return to growth," he added. The Welsh Conservatives have previously called for a shake-up of Finance Wales since it thinks its loans are too big for many small firms. They would establish Invest Wales, splitting Wales into six regions where banks or post offices could host the service in the hope that it would make state help more accessible to local businesses. </body>

      <body>House prices have risen again as interest from buyers outstripped the number of properties coming onto the market, according to a report. The imbalance between supply and demand caused prices to increase during October, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. Its latest survey for Scotland records a balance of 52% more chartered surveyors reporting price increases. This is the highest proportion since 2007. Sarah Speirs, director of Rics Scotland, said: "The housing market is gathering momentum and buyer numbers are on the rise across Scotland. "That said, the number of homes currently up for sale is still nowhere near enough to keep up with demand and, in order for the market to function correctly, this imbalance urgently needs to be addressed. "If we are to create a more sustainable market, it is critical that many more good-quality homes are built in areas where people want to live." Those responding to the survey report "encouraging levels of activity" and a "noticeable shortage of new stock" in some parts of the country. Kevin J Macdonald, from Graham and Sibbald, said: "This year has seen a marked increase in numbers of purchasers looking to buy and prices being paid, with many properties also now taking less time to sell than had previously been the case. The reintroduction of closing dates is a further positive sign." Demand for rental property has risen more modestly than in previous months, with a balance of 13% of surveyors reporting a rise in interest from potential tenants during October. </body>

      <title>Scotland approves new cancer drugs</title>
      <description>Scotland becomes the first part of the United Kingdom to approve two new cancer drugs for routine use on the NHS.</description>

      <body>Scotland has become the first part of the UK to approve two new cancer drugs for routine use in the NHS. Enzalutamide, a treatment that could extend the life of men with advanced prostate cancer, has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. The SMC has also approved axitinib, a drug that could help kidney cancer patients whose disease has spread. The decisions have been welcomed by doctors and cancer charities. Prostate cancer affects more than 2,500 people in Scotland each year, with the disease becoming more advanced in 10% to 20% of sufferers. Dr Rob Jones, senior lecturer and honorary consultant in medical oncology at the University of Glasgow, said the approval of enzalutamide was a "notable milestone" which "paves the way for more men to be given precious extra months at a stage of life when time and quality of life is so cherished". Rob Lester, chairman of the Edinburgh and Lothian Prostate Cancer Support Group, also welcomed the decision. He said: "In recent years the number of people diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland has increased and now many men and their families are affected year on year. "Today's news brings fresh hope for these individuals. We look forward to a time when more men with advanced prostate cancer are eligible for this treatment." Campaigners from the Prostate Cancer UK charity said they would now campaign for enzalutamide to be made routinely available on the NHS elsewhere in the UK. The SMC also accepted the use of axitinib for treating kidney cancer patients, for whom some other previous treatments have failed. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which approves drugs for use on the NHS in England, has already decided not to recommend axitinib for use, meaning patients south of the border have to try to use the Cancer Drugs Fund to get the treatment. On average there are more than 800 cases of kidney cancer a year in Scotland, with about 340 deaths a year from the disease. Dr Jones, also a consultant at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, said: "It gives eligible patients access to an effective second-line treatment option where they previously had none." "It is also a positive sign for improving cancer outcomes for patients in Scotland where traditionally outcomes fall behind other European countries." Dr David Montgomery, medical director of drugs company Pfizer Oncology UK, said: "This important decision will benefit advanced kidney cancer patients in Scotland. "Historically access to cancer medicines has been a challenge in Scotland, compared with other European countries where oncologists regularly have access to a number of second-line advanced kidney cancer treatments. "This decision is a step in the right direction for improving access to cancer medicines in Scotland and improving outcomes for patients." </body>

      <body>A report into a GP who filmed intimate sexual examinations with a camera hidden in a watch has found a senior GP had concerns about his behaviour. Davinderjit Bains from Swindon pleaded guilty to 39 sexual offences in May. He was sentenced to 12 years in jail. The 46-year-old, who worked at Tinkers Lane Surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett, was struck off the medical register. A spokesman for NHS England said steps had been taken to reduce the risk of a similar incident happening again. The NHS report into the way the surgery was run, which was written in January when Bains was being investigated but which has only just been made public, found a senior GP had concerns about Bains' attitude to patients but was unsure what to do about it. It also found the surgery did not offer chaperones to people having intimate examinations. Such as policy has since been brought in. The report found the need for a better complaints procedure, a better whistle-blowing policy and more training for staff. A spokesman for NHS England said: "We have worked with the GPs and practice team from Tinkers Lane Surgery, reviewing processes and policies, and made changes to any areas that fell short of best practice, with particular regard to chaperone policies. "We have also worked promptly with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), who have been involved in reviewing the quality of services provided at the surgery, and who have made specific recommendations relating to three key areas of care. "We again extend our sincere apologies, on behalf of the NHS, to all those affected by the evil actions of this individual." Bains, from Nyland Road, Swindon, pleaded guilty in May to sexual offences against 32 victims aged between 14 and 51. </body>

      <title>Fears for London A&amp;E units in winter</title>
      <description>Fears are raised about how London's A&amp;E departments will cope this winter as figures reveal patients are waiting too long to be treated.</description>

      <body>Concerns have been raised about how well the AandE departments of London's hospitals will cope this winter. Figures released by the London Assembly show that half of such units failed to reach their targets to treat 95% of patients within four hours. It said it feared the system would be put under further "stress" and long-term plans needed to be implemented. The NHS for London said it was prepared for winter but the capital's increasing population remained a challenge. In Risks to London AandE Services this Winter data analysed by the assembly (LA) shows that six London trusts missed the recommended target to register, treat and discharge patients within four hours, at least 80% of the time. Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals Trust missed the target every week seeing 84.8% of patients within the time. But Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust consistently met the target and attended 98% of patients within four hours throughout last year. Dr Onkar Sahota, Chair of the London Assembly Health Committee, said: "The failure of half of all trusts to consistently treat 95% of patients within four hours shows that the health care system is under stress and cannot be allowed to continue. "NHS England (London) must publish immediately the recovery and improvement plans that have been agreed with each of London's AandE departments." The LA said it wanted the proposals published so they can be considered before the winter months and "restore public confidence" in the service. Dr Andy Mitchell, medical director for NHS England in London said: "The NHS in London is well prepared and has plans in place. "However...London's population is increasing and the way in which we currently organise and run services is unsustainable unless we make radical changes." In the report the head of NHS England in London, Dr Anne Rainsberry, said improvements to primary, community and social care would mean fewer elderly people would be admitted to AandE. She added that small departments which were not able to provide "as good a level of care as they could do" could also be closed to help improve the overall situation. The figure to register, treat, and discharge 95% patients within four hours was reduced from 98% in 2010. </body>

      <body>England are to switch bases ahead of friendlies against Chile and Germany after a stomach bug alert at the site of the National Football Centre. A small number of visitors to St George's Park in Staffordshire were affected over the weekend, said the Football Association in a statement.  No players have experienced any virus symptoms but the Under-21s are moving hotels as a precaution. The senior side will meet up in Hertfordshire instead. They will report to the Grove Hotel near Watford on Tuesday before training at London Colney, while the Under-21s are relocating to Milton Keynes. "This is an elite athlete precaution for the two senior teams," said the FA in a statement. "Normal operations continue for St George's Park and hotel staff, customers and the public. "To reiterate, these proactive steps have been taken by the FA as a precautionary measure." England's senior side have two matches at Wembley, against Chile on Friday and Germany on Tuesday, 19 November. The Under-21s face Finland at MK Dons on Thursday and San Marino at Shrewsbury five days later in European Championship qualifiers. </body>

      <title>Massa deal 'shows Williams ambition'</title>
      <description>Signing Felipe Massa is proof that Williams can return to winning ways, says deputy team principal Claire Williams.</description>

      <body>Williams say signing Brazilian Felipe Massa from Ferrari is proof they are determined to return to winning ways after years of declining form. Williams dominated Formula 1 for much of the 1980s and '90s but have scored only one point this year. Deputy team principal Claire Williams said: "We've done a lot of work this year in order to turn this team around and we want to tell the world that. "Williams are not satisfied with coming ninth in the championship." She said Massa's decision to join the team alongside Finn Valtteri Bottas was the latest in a series of moves aimed at revitalising the former world champions. They have already signed a deal to switch from Renault to Mercedes engines, taken on a new technical director in Pat Symonds, who has won world titles with Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso at Benetton/Renault, and further changes in engineering staff are on the way. Williams said: "We've made some very clear decisions this year from announcing the Mercedes partnership to bringing in a new technical director in Pat Symonds, and this [signing Massa] is another piece of our jigsaw to tell the world that Williams is determined to come back and determined to fight for world championships again." Williams said persuading Massa, a 32-year-old 11-time grand prix winner, to join "wasn't actually too hard a sell - it's so clear to see this team is made up of fighters and people who want to win F1 races". Williams have been on a downward trend in recent years, halted only by an upturn in form in 2012, when they won their first race since 2004 thanks to Pastor Maldonado at the Spanish Grand Prix. Massa has been signed as replacement for the Venezuelan, who is now likely to drive for Lotus but also has options at Force India and Sauber. "Pastor has done a great job for Williams these three seasons and it's a shame he's leaving us, but he wants to go on and find a new challenge," said Williams, who described Bottas as "a real talent" and said partnering Massa with him is "really exciting". Williams are in the middle of a recruitment drive aimed at strengthening the team. One of the new signings will be Massa's Ferrari race engineer Rob Smedley, who is joining ahead of 2014 in a more senior role overseeing race engineering. Smedley has become famous for his down-to-earth radio communication with Massa in the past few years, including the notorious "Fernando [Alonso] is faster than you" message when Ferrari imposed team orders on their drivers at the 2010 German Grand Prix. Asked whether Smedley had signed, Claire Williams said: "We're working very hard to address the problems we have in-house. We have some great talent in Williams but we need to make sure we have all the talent we need to perform right at the top. "So I'm hoping that before the end of the season or maybe slightly after we'll be making some more announcements in a similar vein to this one [Massa]. Whether that involves a certain engineer or other engineers I can't tell you." She emphasised that any deal with Smedley was independent of Massa. "They don't come as a package," she said. "They come separately. They are very much their own people. "So if Rob Smedley was to join our team, it has to be on his terms, and he has to be given a role he wants to do and that may or may not be Felipe's race engineer. "Felipe is grown-up enough to join a team without bringing his race engineer with him." </body>

      <body>England will play France in the World Cup quarter-finals after Les Tricolores lost 22-6 to Samoa in a feisty Group B clash in Perpignan. France and Samoa knew the winner would finish as group runners-up and book a place against Fiji, who came third in Group A, in the last eight. The sides were level 6-6 at half-time before Samoa scored three second-half tries to condemn France to third. Now France play England at Wigan's DW Stadium on Saturday (20:00 GMT). Both teams were already assured of a quarter-final spot, alongside group winners New Zealand, after one win and one defeat in their opening two matches. But each wanted to produce a confidence-boosting performance - with the added bonus of avoiding England - ahead of the knockout stage. The World Cup has provided plenty of entertainment in the opening fortnight and the group stage drew to a close with another full-blooded encounter in the south of France. Samoa scored the opening try after four minutes when winger Daniel Vidot finished a sweeping cross-field move in the right corner. Full-back Anthony Milford converted with an impressive touchline kick. France quickly recovered in front of a passionate home crowd to apply plenty of pressure on the Samoan line, but found their rhythm disrupted by a series of late tackles on half-backs William Barthau and Thomas Bosc. Referee Henry Perenara finally lost patience with the Pacific Islanders and sent Mose Masoe to the sin-bin when the replacement prop charged into Bosc after the Frenchman had already off-loaded the ball. And France made their numerical advantage count within six minutes. Full-back Morgan Escare scampered inside from the right wing to touch down behind the posts, with Bosc adding the extras to level. Samoa started the second half brightly and man-of-the-match Milford unlocked the France defence with some nifty footwork to touch down after 46 minutes. France showed more attacking intent than they had in their previous matches against Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, but a mixture of spurned opportunities and superb Samoan defence denied them a second try. And they were punished as Pita Godinet and Justin Moors scored further tries as Samoa set up a quarter-final tie against Southern Pacific neighbours Fiji in Warrington on Sunday. France: Escare, Vaccari, Baile, Duport, Greenshields, Bosc, Barthau, Fakir, Pelissier, Casty, Larroyer, Raguin, Mounis. Replacements: Gigot, Maria, Garcia, Simon. Samoa: Milford, Winterstein, Lafai, Leilua, Vidot, Godinet, Roberts, Fa'alogo, Sio, Matagi, Soliola, Ah Mau, Sue. Replacements: Puletua, Moors, Taufua, Masoe.

      <body>Before his death at the age of 30, photographer Tony Ray-Jones spent the latter half of the 1960s travelling across England trying to capture a disappearing way of life. His distinctive take on English eccentricity had a profound influence on a young photography student at the time - Martin Parr - who, himself, would go on to have a distinguished career behind the lens. Martin Parr has selected dozens of Tony Ray-Jones' images to be shown at the Science Museum in London, alongside some of his own rarely seen images from the 1970s. Here, take a few minutes to look back at a bygone era. Only in England: Photographs by Tony Ray-Jones and Martin Parr can be seen at the Science Museum, London, until 16 March 2014.

      <title>Aiming to change the outcome of WWI</title>
      <description>As many countries pay tribute to fallen soldiers, remembering the day hostilities ended in WWI, the people of Kurdistan are still hoping to change its outcome.</description>

      <body>Even at moments of remembrance the origins of World War One seem as distant as the fall of Rome. The steps in the doomed diplomatic dance in the summer of 1914 are hopelessly remote to the modern mind. It's not just the imperial ambitions and the strategic balances - this was a world where politicians still wore frock coats and the seditious syncopations of ragtime were an affront to Christian decency. But there are places where the furtive manoeuvrings of the politicians - which went on in parallel with the fighting - still feel like unfinished business. Very few Western Europeans could tell you what the main result of World War One really was - except that it led directly to World War Two. It brought countless indirect changes too of course, but they are hard to measure. The role of women in parts of Europe and North America at least, was transformed. And, perhaps, a habit of deference vanished too. Before the Great War domestic service was the biggest employer in British society. After it everyone but the very rich had to learn to make their own tea and iron their own jodhpurs. In Irbil though, capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, everyone knows what the main result of World War One was - and everyone sees it as unfinished business. When the guns fell silent the Kurds were left without a homeland. And they're still without one. The Kurds were divided between Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey, their dreams of statehood crushed. But as the rest of the world prepares to remember the start of the war, there are people in Kurdistan who think it's possible that they might be about to change the outcome. The principal architects of the post-world-war order in the Middle East were a pair of British and French diplomats, Sir Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot. To them fell the task of dividing up the empire of Germany's most important ally - Turkey, an empire which included much of the Middle East. The goal was not, of course, to improve the lot of the Arab peoples struggling under the Turkish yoke - it was to make sure that Britain and France emerged from the costly carnage in Europe with some sort of tangible benefit. Their secret talks were concluded about a month before the Battle of the Somme began in 1916. In many ways the world still lives with the consequences of the decisions made and the promises given around that time. There were assurances to Arab leaders about the post-war rewards Britain could offer in return for fighting the Turks. And there was the Balfour Declaration, which committed the British to the establishment of a national home in Palestine for the Jewish people. It could have been even more complicated. If Imperial Russia had survived to take a share of the spoils, it might have got Istanbul. But for the Kurds there was to be nothing. Now though, 100 years on from the Great War, the self-serving map on which the victorious powers sketched out new countries like Iraq and Syria is fraying at the edges. Syria, which was given to the French, may not survive the grinding misery of its own civil war as a unitary state. And the prosperous Kurdish part of Iraq feels more and more like a different country from the troubled Arab south. It has a flag, an anthem, armed forces and it's got oil too. Businessmen who trade there compare it to the Dubai of 20 years ago. Might that growing autonomy one day crystallise into statehood? In a smoky tea room, dug like a cave into the heart of the ancient market in Irbil, the disappointments of history have made men cautious. But a sense of optimism now pervades the atmosphere as palpably as the thick fug of tobacco smoke, which stains the old photographs on the wall a darker shade of sepia. Sir Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot - largely forgotten in their own countries, and not much admired by those who do remember them - would blush to know how often their names crop up in conversation in Kurdish cities like Irbil. At times of remembrance in Western Europe most of us, perhaps, tend to focus on the small things and the personal - the fighting, for example, brought the first of my relatives to Britain to fight its wars and then dig its roads. The bigger questions - was there anything to show for all that suffering? - are just too big and too bleak. But in Irbil, and in other Kurdish cities too, there's a growing feeling that a change in the outcome of the fighting which has been a century in the making might finally be within reach.

      <title>JFK and the rise of conspiracy theories</title>
      <description>It's 50 years since Kennedy's assassination. Will Self wonders if this was when Westerners started to distrust official accounts.</description>

      <body>With the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's assassination approaching, Will Self wonders if this was when Westerners started to distrust official accounts. In Dealey Plaza the light quality was dun-to-sepia and the jackhammers of the highways department drumming on the sainted tarmac seemed to presage some terrible event yet to happen. Near to the workmen were two white crosses painted on the tarmac. Pointing them out to me, a ragged and quite possibly homeless man explained that the first marked the spot the president's motorcade had reached when the first of the assassin's bullets hit, while the second cross marked the entry point of the second bullet. Another destitute man who was sauntering past snarled out of the corner of his mouth: "Don't listen to him, he's working for the government." I resisted the urge to quip, "Well, if he is they certainly aren't paying him enough," because, standing on the grassy knoll, within yards of where John F Kennedy met his end, and within days of the half-centenary of this momentous event, levity hardly felt appropriate. But then this begged the question - what is the appropriate way to commemorate a political assassination? Taken as a collectivity - which, after all, is often how Americans wish to be considered - their response to this conundrum has been curiously muted. On the evening of the day I explored Dealey Plaza and its environs I spoke with an academic at a local college who - like so many others - vividly remembered that day in November 1963. A child growing up in a mixed Irish and Mexican-American, North Dallas blue-collar neighbourhood, she recalled the people coming out of their houses to stand, many weeping uncontrollably, in their front yards. "In their homes," she told me, "they would have two iconic portraits. Images painted in profile, in garish oils on black velvet backgrounds. One would be of the pope, the other of Kennedy." The years, and now the decades of lubricious revelations have tarnished John F Kennedy's once coruscating lustre, and standing in the overcast plaza I couldn't help but see a parallel between this and the way the prospect before me - such a cramped, workaday urban space - contrasted with the mythic realm depicted by Abraham Zapruder's infamous film of the assassination. Zapruder's footage became emblematic of the growing mediatisation of public events in the 1960s. A decade that began with disasters still happening in far away countries of which we knew very little and saw virtually nothing, ended with the emaciated stick-figure victims of the Biafran War lolling listlessly on our television screens, intercut with near-live film of US Army helicopters strafing North Vietnamese villages with heavy-calibre machine guns. Kennedy's assassination was the epitome of this new phenomenon, fitting as it did celebrity, glamour, tragedy, bloodshed, sex and power within the compass of a single lens. And then there were the conspiracy theories. In back of the knoll itself - which is actually a crescent-shaped verge of modest proportions - I found local historian Mark Oakes beside his rather permanent-looking stall. A tall, well-preserved man, with a full head of dark hair, cut Kennedy-like en brosse, Oakes had, he told me, become fixated when in 1971, still a high school senior, he had read right through the many fat volumes of the Warren Commission's report into the assassination. Forty-two years later, he shows the Zapruder film on a portable DVD player along with clips of his own TV appearances. He also has an array of books and pamphlets available and, without any soliciting on my part, he quickly offered to sell me copies of the president's autopsy photographs "autographed" - as he put it - by one of the technicians who had assisted. Yet the surprise for me wasn't this macabre obsessiveness but Oakes's response when I asked him, "Come on then, who did it?" Because instead of coming out with one or other of the myriad conspiracy theories that have rooted over the years in the psychic mulch formed by so much tortured regard, he instead shrugged his shoulders and replied, "I dunno, there are so many possible candidates: the mob, the CIA, the Teamsters - you can take your pick." When I taxed him: "But you do believe there was a conspiracy, don't you?", he continued, "I would say a cover-up, definitely - but I don't know about a conspiracy." In fact, as we continued talking, it became clear that Oakfield's main evidence for the assumption that the real character of this momentous event had been wilfully obscured was his own disbarment from its mediatisation. "They never have me on NBC or any of the other major networks," he said, his rich baritone rising slightly into moan. Heading into the former Texas School Book Depository, which now houses, in the very place from which those shots were allegedly fired (its sixth floor), a museum dedicated to the assassination, I reflected on how it was that Oakfield personified the relationship between the individual and history in the era of mass media. Both conspiracy and cover-up are nostrums designed to reassure us that our feelings of powerlessness and irrelevance are justified. How can we be expected to do anything about these dreadful things that are happening right in front of our eyes if they simultaneously lie to us and refuse to let us have our say? The museum was muted and tasteful. We had been warned by the youth at the ticket desk not to take any photographs. What Oswald may - or may not - have seen through his rifle sights has now been copyrighted by the Associated Press. Naturally, I ignored this. As for the window from which Oswald just might have shot the white hope of American democracy, from an adjacent one I looked down at the white crosses in the roadway at a steep angle through tree foliage. For a historic distance it seemed a small one - a model of the trajectory rather than the trajectory itself. The actual window had been glassed off and transformed into a tableau mordant of how it might have looked 50 years ago, complete with repositories of musty school text books. Walking across downtown Dallas I mulled over with my two companions - both American, one a native Texan - the strange sense I had that the museum had done its job. Even the Jackie Kennedy replica pearls in the gift shop and the ashtrays inscribed "Carpe Diem" played their part, for in commodification - this being America - there was also a certain historicity. The assassination, I said, now seems to belong definitively to the past, rather than to some Zapruder film-loop of the permanent present. Mike, the Texan, said he thought that this might be true, and instanced the fact that the man who once plied a trade driving tourists around the plaza in an open-topped Lincoln limousine, seemed to have hung up his ignition key. "When he drove over the Xs, a tape recorder in the car played realistic rifle shot effects," Mike said. Fifty is a lot of years, and before the elongation of western lifespans would have been accorded a couple of generations. Belying Oakes's youthful appearance, the fact remains that what's been covered up for him is not what's been hidden from contemporary Americans. In a year that saw the exposure of the National Security Agency's tentacular sucker-prints all over the VDUs of the wired world, the half-century-old arguments about whether the camera ever lied begin to seem hopelessly recondite. It isn't so much, I think, that the Kennedy assassination has transitioned smoothly into a commonsensical past. It's rather that it is the first instance of a peculiarly modern variant of the historic event - its media simulation. Since that November day in Dealey Plaza, the generality of Westerners have ceased, in an important way, to lend credence to the effusions of the media. Far from believing that the camera never lies, we suspect that like our political leaders, it always does. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>'Openness needed' on Whitehall deals</title>
      <description>Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a "crisis of confidence", the National Audit office warns.</description>

      <body>Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a "crisis of confidence", the National Audit Office has warned. Firms such as Serco, Capita, G4S and Atos were being paid hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it said. But the spending watchdog urged more punishments - such as fines and exclusions from future contracts - where "problems" were reported. The government said it was working to create better value for money. The National Audit Office (NAO) has published two reports looking at major public service contracts. It said Serco's were worth £1.8bn, including £611m with the Ministry of Defence and £382m with local government. Capita's totalled £1.08bn, while those for G4S and Atos were £718m and £683m respectively. The NAO said the Cabinet Office, which oversees much of central government, often lacked "commercial experience and expertise below senior levels", and information on its 40 strategic suppliers was "inconsistent and incomplete". The public sector profit margins for Serco appeared to be between 0% and 9%, between 1% and 10% for Capita, and between 3% and 22% for Atos. G4S made an overall loss on some of its public sector contracts last year, giving an overall return ranging from -8% to 16%. The reports mentioned continuing investigations into issues with contractors, including the Ministry of Justice looking at the way G4S and Serco had billed it for electronic tag monitoring. The NAO said: "Transparency is needed to ensure that no-one within the contractor can hide problems and that it is in the contractors' commercial interest to focus on their client's (the government's) needs." Companies would "likely concentrate on maintaining shareholder value", it said, adding: "Government needs to ensure that it is in the contractors' financial interests to focus their control environment more widely on meeting the standards expected of public service. "This involves using contractual entitlements to information, audit and inspection to ensure standards are being met. "And it is likely to involve financial penalties, banning from competitions and political fallout when problems are found." NAO head Amyas Morse said there was "a crisis of confidence at present, caused by some worrying examples of contractors not appearing to treat the public sector fairly, and of departments themselves not being on top of things." He added: "While some government departments have been admirably quick off the mark and transparent in investigating problems, there is a clear need to reset the ground rules for both contractors and their departmental customers." A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "Last year alone we saved taxpayers £3.8bn from our commercial reforms, including renegotiating contracts with our largest suppliers, and we welcome the NAO's recognition of our achievements. "Since the general election we have made it easier for smaller businesses to work with Whitehall and many more are winning contracts." He added: "We know that the civil service lacks commercial capability and that contract management needs to be improved. "Our reform programme seeks to address this but we must accelerate change to save taxpayers more, create better quality public services and promote growth." </body>

      <title>PM to lead trade delegation to China</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a trade delegation to China next month, he tells an audience in the City of London.</description>

      <body>David Cameron is to lead a delegation of ministers and business figures to China next month, he has announced. The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. "I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples," he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's "vast and varied markets" he said, adding: "This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come." Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the "global economy" was not a "zero sum game". "As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?' I believe we need to say a very firm 'No',". </body>

      <body>Former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin is to lead a Labour-backed taskforce on developing young people's digital skills. Party leader Ed Miliband will say in a speech that the UK is falling behind on IT and the government is "letting down" businesses and the workforce. Ms Philbin said she was "completely independent" of party politics. Her aim was to encourage "brilliant young people", she added. Ms Philbin, who is chief executive of TeenTech, which arranges science career visits for schoolchildren, presented the BBC's Tomorrow's World, the science and technology programme which ran from 1965 to 2003. She also presented BBC children's show Swap Shop. She said: "I am delighted to be leading this digital skills taskforce on how Britain might encourage our brilliant young people to develop the skills of the future. "Britain has led the world in new technologies for decades but we need to make sure we do everything to maintain that success by training and developing the talents that our country needs. "I would like to emphasise that this is a completely independent piece of work which will be shared with all political parties to inform future policies as they see fit." During his speech, Mr Miliband will say skills are essential to enable the UK to "earn our way out of the cost-of-living crisis, rebuild our economy for the future, and ensure all working people can enjoy the prosperity they deserve". The government says Labour would increase borrowing, reducing prosperity, and that recent improvements to the economy will help households. </body>

      <body>Almost 9,000 people die from conditions related to alcohol each year in the UK. A former government drugs advisor, Professor David Nutt, believes it is possible to have the sensation of alcohol - minus the risk to your health. But the power of the drinks industry means that it would be difficult to bring this product to market. Professor Nutt, says that not only has he identified compounds that can give the sensation of alcohol, but also one which can reverse those effects - meaning people could become instantly sober - and he is trying to find investors willing to develop the idea. He said: "I think this would be a serious revolution in health... just like the e-cigarette is going to revolutionise the smoking of tobacco. "I find it weird that we haven't been speaking about this before, as it's such a target for health improvement." First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday 11 November 2013. </body>

      <description>A Victorian model's tragic story set for the stage</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24803177</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70994000/jpg/_70994113_emma-west-as-lizzie-siddal-.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>In 1849, Lizzie Siddal was plucked from obscurity to pose for some of the best-known painters of the Victorian art world. Now her tragic life story is being brought to the stage for the first time. Elizabeth Siddal has been described by one biographer as a "Pre-Raphaelite supermodel". The most well-known story about her time as a painter's subject is when she almost died while posing in a bathtub for Sir John Everett Millais as he painted his drowning Ophelia in 1852. It was just one extraordinary incident in Siddal's short life - she died aged 32 - which features in a new play that premieres in London this month. "We were genuinely surprised that no-one had done it [on stage] before, because it seems like such a gift of a story," says actress Emma West, who plays the lead role in Lizzie Siddal. The Siddal story was most recently told on TV in BBC Two's Desperate Romantics in 2009. At the rehearsal space in south London, where the new play is taking shape, all eyes are drawn to the full-size reproduction of the Millais painting propped against the wall - with Ophelia singing as she sinks to a watery grave. The scene, described in Shakespeare's Hamlet, is one of the best-known works of Pre-Raphaelite art and is the most popular postcard sold by the Tate, which has the original in its permanent collection. "It's one of those paintings you can't tire of looking at - it is so vibrant and lifelike," says West. With her red hair and pale complexion, the actress looks uncannily like the tragic figure in the picture. Indeed, she recalls how on the two occasions she has visited the Tate to see the work, complete strangers have asked her to pose in front of it. "The last time it was a couple of Japanese tourists who were quite freaked out [by the resemblance], it seemed to me." So who was Lizzie Siddal? Born in 1829, she was aged around 20 and working in a hat shop when she was "discovered" by artist Walter Deverell. She soon became a favourite model for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - the group of young painters who wanted to revolutionise the Victorian art world. Over a period of several months, she posed for Millais' Ophelia in a bath full of water kept warm by lamps placed underneath. The lamps went out on one occasion and the water turned ice cold, although Siddal did not complain. Millais was so absorbed in his work and did not notice. Siddal fell ill, and her father threatened the artist with legal action until he agreed to pay the medical fees. Siddal also became an artist in her own right, although painting was an unusual career for a woman in those days. She became the muse of the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and appeared in many of his works. After a long and turbulent engagement, they married in 1860, but a year afterwards Siddal had a stillborn daughter. Suffering depression and addicted to laudanum, Siddal died in February 1862. "The more you read about her the more fascinating she becomes," says playwright Jeremy Green. "Here's a woman who, with no advantages, became famous as a model; but that wasn't sufficient, she wanted to produce art and, falling in love, she wanted to be fulfilled in her love - and in pursuit of both she met tragic consequences. "It's a play about love and death and immortality." The idea for the play, directed by Lotte Wakeham, goes back two years when Green wrote a short film, Ophelia, about the Millais "bathtub" incident. Emma West, who played Siddal in the film too, got a taste of what the Victorian model went through in Millais' studio. "I had the experience of lying in the bath - the longest I did was five or six hours," she recalls. "That's a helpful thing to have done, despite the fact that my fingers were prune-like. The crew were scooping cold water out and pouring in hot water so I was fine." West adds: "It's tempting to think, 'How cruel of Millais', but actually there was nothing to stop Lizzie saying, 'It's getting a bit cold now'. But she didn't. "She chose to try and be the perfect model for him. That's a fantastic clue to her psychology, because what made her attractive to these painters is that she did have a sense of understanding of what they were trying to achieve." As well as seeing the Ophelia painting at the Tate, West also visited Lizzie Siddal's grave in the Rossetti family plot in London's Highgate Cemetery. She was told by the cemetery guide that it is a place of pilgrimage for Lizzie Siddal devotees. "It's predominantly men, who get far more emotional than the women do!" What were her emotions standing at the grave? "I feel a sense of responsibility. When I knew we were going to tell her story I felt I should pay my respects in some way, just to say, 'We're taking this seriously and I hope we do you justice.'" West, meanwhile, describes Siddal as "a trailblazer". "She would dress differently and people would mock her sometimes and she didn't care. She was genuinely nourished by the art. "She was the genuine article." Lizzie Siddal is at the Arcola Theatre, London E8, from 20 November - 21 December 2013. </body>

      <description>How biometrics make your voice the best weapon against fraud</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24898367</url>

      <body>Big business wants your voice - not for customer feedback, but to tackle fraud. Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <description>How UK aid agencies are preparing Philippines relief</description>

      <body>A state of national calamity has been declared in the Philippines as relief efforts get under way to ease the plight of thousands of victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which swept across the country on Friday. There has been massive destruction and loss of life, with as many as 10,000 people thought to have died and thousands more left destitute and waiting for relief efforts to reach them. What are the UK Government and aid agencies doing to help? The Department for International Development has pledged urgent humanitarian support for as many as 500,000 people affected by the disaster and has activated the UK's Rapid Response Facility, which provides emergency support via pre-approved organisations in the event of a humanitarian disaster overseas. This includes releasing £5m to partners on the ground so they can provide assistance such as including temporary shelter and access to clean water. The UK is also donating shelter materials, such as plastic sheeting, and household items like kitchen sets and blankets from the UK's stockpile of humanitarian items in Dubai - worth a further £600,000. The government has sent three British humanitarian advisors, who arrived in the Philippines on Saturday. They are working with the agencies on the ground and the government of the Philippines to assess the scale of the need and advise on what the UK can do to help. The British Red Cross already had workers in the Philippines helping victims of the earthquake which struck the Bohol area last month. They have been redirected to help in the aftermath of the typhoon. Another team has flown out to the Philippines from the UK. The organisation has contributed £100,000 to the relief effort and is appealing for more donations from the public. It has sent a logistics deployment to Philippines capital Manila, which is being deployed to the badly hit area of Cebu, where the British Red Cross has a distribution hub. Already 280 cubic metres of relief materials have been sent to the area from Malaysia, including 10,000 tarpaulins, 20,000 jerry cans and 47,000 hygiene kits. More supplies are due in Cebu from a Red Cross warehouse in Dubai on Tuesday. Meanwhile, workers at the British Red Cross's warehouse in Bristol will spend Tuesday loading logistical supplies such as computers, printers, forklift trucks, vehicles, as well as water purification and sanitation kits, tents and heavy duty kit, which will be flown out from Stansted airport on Thursday. A shelter expert will also be on the flight. A spokeswoman said: "It's going to be a long operation. We're setting up for months and years." Oxfam has launched a £10m public appeal to raise money to help 500,000 people in the disaster zone. The money will be used for water tanks and latrines to ensure a safe water supply and toilets, as well as providing temporary shelter for people who have lost their homes. The charity has already sent its rapid assessment teams to the affected areas of Samar, Leyte and northern Cabu to provide emergency supplies of water, sanitation and shelter. An aid shipment of water and sanitation equipment from the UK is expected to be dispatched within the next 48 hours. Spokesman Graham Mackay said: "Our main concern is getting relief to the worst affected areas. Because communications are down the real extent of this horrific disaster is still not known." The charity says the most urgent needs are for food, water and shelter. Communities also need to have power and communications restored and roads need to be cleared so that aid can get through. Save the Children has provisions stockpiled in a warehouse in Dubai. It is expecting to fly 40 tonnes of medical equipment, materials to build shelters, health and sanitation equipment to the disaster area on Wednesday morning, along with logistics experts and technicians to help with building. It also has assessment teams in the Philippines gathering information on the situation there and on what work needs to be done. The charity will focus particularly on child protection, setting up child-friendly spaces, where children can play and attempting to deliver books so they can continue some form of learning since many schools have been destroyed. With many children separated from their families, it hopes to help them feel safer and less frightened on their own. It has launched an appeal for money and estimates the cost of its efforts will be $30m (£18.7m). Care International UK has a small team already on the ground in the coastal province of Leyte which has been badly affected. Two shelter experts flew out from the UK on Friday and are assessing what needs to be done. A spokeswoman said the charity hoped to help 30,000 families in the province - an estimated 150,000 people - by providing shelter, water and food, which it says are the most immediate needs. Its staff are sourcing supplies in the Philippines capital Manila including rice, cooking utensils and tarpaulins for shelter. It has also launched a public appeal for money and hopes to raise $5m (£3.1m) globally to fund its operations. </body>

      <title>John Lewis's Christmas ad: 10 interpretations</title>
      <description>10 interpretations of the new John Lewis advert</description>

      <body>John Lewis's Christmas advert is now one of the most discussed parts of the festive run-up. But what does this year's offering mean? The 2013 ad is an animated tale of a hare battling to ensure a bear doesn't miss out on the festivities accompanied by Lily Allen singing Keane's Somewhere Only We Know. While the bear is asleep, the hare sneaks back to his cave and deposits a small package wrapped in red paper and tied up with a green bow. "The store's animation, using old-fashioned line drawing (by artists who worked on The Lion King), features a rather grumpy brown bear and his friend, a hare, who looks - with his doleful eyes - as if he has jumped straight out of Watership Down to escape the bulldozers." says the Telegraph's Harry Wallop. BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips goes one step further. Alongside the headline "The John Lewis Christmas Ad: Alternate Ending" he links to a YouTube video simply entitled Watership Down Violence. He apologises swiftly after. James Murphy, the chief executive of Adam and Eve DDB - the agency which made the advert - reveals the agency was aware of the similarity early on. When he showed an early edit to his wife, she was crying "within ten seconds". "She said the hare reminded her of the rabbit character" in Watership Down. John Lewis "has again eschewed celebrities in favour of trying to make you cry", observes Wallop. The marketing news site The Drum says John Lewis is "seeking to tug on the heart strings". While it has touched some, it hasn't made everyone cry, notes Brand Republic. "Some 80% of the tweets praised the ad, describing it as 'cute' and 'sweet', while 5% of tweeters claimed the ad had reduced them to tears." One tweeter who did admit to crying was Loren Saunders who tweeted "I well up at the John Lewis advert everytime," "Part of its ambition, in the words of Craig Inglis, its marketing director, is to 'connect emotionally with our customers'," Wallop suggests. "The bear has never experienced Christmas because he spends all winter hibernating in a cave, we learn. This makes the hare even sadder, but he gives the sleeping bear a present in the hope he might be roused from his slumber and join in the woodland fun. Since the gift is an alarm clock, his ruse works." Murphy says his advertising agency inherited the same brief that the previous agency had "which is to talk about what we call thoughtful gifting. "There is a unifying theme. If you want to find a gift for someone you love that they would love then come to John Lewis." "The real star this year is the song," says Wallop. He calls the folksy style Allen adopts as "John Lewis's trademark tug-at-the-heartstrings style". Wallop thinks she's made a canny move. "She is in little doubt that it is a sensible 'way of stepping back into the marketplace' after three years away to have children". Campaign Magazine's Ben Bold says it's "the biggest advertising event of the year". Wallop cites research from market analysts at Nielsen which claims retailers will spend about £390m on advertising over the last three months of 2013. John Lewis alone is spending £7 million on its Christmas campaign. "This is a remarkable turn of events. Only a few years ago, it was predicted that TV advertising would slowly die, as we all started to watch programmes on catch-up boxes, such as Sky Plus, or on tablet computers." The Sun says X Factor viewers "branded the ad breaks better than the show itself". But the ad appears to miss out one vital component - the products they are trying to sell. "Not entirely sure how this helps sell Le Creuset casserole dishes", BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips muses. But from the 2011 ad onward the ads don't feature specific John Lewis products. Marketing Week's Sarah Vizard told the Guardian the retailer may appear to be trying not to be a retailer. John Lewis's marketing director Craig Inglis explains in the Guardian: "This is really about telling a story and making that emotional connection. It's not all about glitz and glamour, it's all about animation and the brand." If you watch the ad on YouTube and click on "follow the story" you're directed to a page where you can buy the Lily Allen's single, the bear, the hare and Christmas cards of the bear and the hare among other products related to the advert. When things get this subtle, customers can get confused. Marketing Magazine reports that the teaser to the advert, aired the previous week, confused some people into thinking about Coca Cola. "ITV viewers got a sneak preview of John Lewis' Christmas ad last night when a teaser aired with the hashtag #sleepingbear, although some viewers believe Coca-Cola was behind the ad." All this leaves one question unanswered for Capital FM's Anna Tyler: "How can a hare wrap a present?" Beauty blogger Miss Candy points out: "Chinese people think buying someone a clock is extremely bad luck". Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>UK paper review: Tuesday's front pages</title>
      <description>Concerns over the state of the NHS feature on many front pages</description>

      <body>Concerns over the state of the NHS feature on many of Tuesday's front pages, with the Daily Mail among those predicting a "winter casualty crisis". It reveals the results of an investigation which, it says, showed at least 12,000 patients spent more than 12 hours on trolleys in accident and emergency departments last year. Some 250 waited a whole day for a bed, while one unfortunate patient spent just short of three days on a trolley, according to data obtained by the paper through freedom of information requests. While the Sun leads on claims at a tribunal that a crying baby was shut in a hospital cupboard, both the i and the Guardian focus on a report highlighting a shortage of 20,000 nurses which, it's suggested, is putting patients at risk. Official NHS data, according to the Guardian, shows the service has shed 3,859 full-time posts since the 2010 election. But the Royal College of Nursing claims NHS trusts have not been replacing staff who leave, causing vacancy rates to rise to around 6%. That equates to 20,000 full-time posts, or nearly 34,000 workers when part-time work is taken into account, the report suggests. Reviewing the papers for the BBC News Channel, broadcaster Penny Smith said: "If we have a horrible winter like we did last year, when [the cold weather] went grindingly on for ever and ever and ever, we are going to have real problems." And, noting the i's reports that the prime minister has pledged to personally oversee the NHS response, political journalist Sean Dilley added: "Some might say David Cameron overseeing the NHS is a little bit like volunteering to take the wheel of the Titanic." However, he reminded viewers that - despite the horror stories - the vast majority of patients are happy with the treatment they receive. In his editor's letter, the i's Oliver Duff argues that - while "belts have been tightened" across the public sector - the Department of Health ought to insist that vacancies are filled because nurses are "relieving ever more of the clinical burden from doctors - and in doing so provide excellent value for money". In its leader column, the Mail argues that family doctors are key to relieving the pressure on casualty departments. "The only long-term option is to rewrite the contracts negotiated in 2004 by the Blair government, which gave GPs huge pay rises, while letting them opt out of work in the evenings and at weekends," it writes. "GPs were the cause of this crisis. They must also be the solution." Images of the devastation wrought on the Philippines by Typhoon Haiyan continue to be displayed on many front pages. A striking aerial photograph showing a boat dumped by the winds onto the wreckage-strewn streets of Tacloban is printed across the width of the Daily Telegraph's front page. The paper hears from one survivor who says: "I thought it was the end of the world." Another moving report comes from the Guardian's Kate Hodal, who describes the grisly scene along a stretch of road into the city: "Just past a lone white coffin with gold-painted handles lay a mass of dead, bloated bodies. Men, women, cats, dogs and pigs were piled in a heap against a stone house with a metal roof bent upwards like a question mark," she reports. Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror has an exclusive interview with Britons including Stephanie Lewis and Seb Hall, who it describes huddling together and praying as the typhoon hit the island of Cebu, where they run a travel business for backpackers. The Times is claiming an exclusive lead, reporting that illegally-trafficked organs are being offered for sale to British patients for tens of thousands of pounds. A reporter posed as the relative of a patient in need of a transplant and was told surgery would cost $40,000 (£25,000), plus a $35,000 payment to the donor. It's a story that troubled the BBC News Channel's paper reviewers, with Penny Smith admitting that people might well be tempted to pay up, if they had the money. Sean Dilley said the story was "undoubtedly in the public interest" but added: "To what extent could it unwittingly act as an advert." The tabloids feature extensive coverage of Armistice Day events, notably the funeral of Harold Jellicoe Percival, who was a ground crew member to the Dambusters flights. The veteran had no close friends and only a handful of living family dotted around the globe but about 500 strangers answered a funeral directors' advert to pay their respects in Lancashire, says the Daily Express. "Strangers came in their droves to pay their respects in the crematorium chapel, while others stood in the rain to say farewell to the fallen hero known as Coe," said the Sun, while the Daily Star labels it the "most moving poppy story ever". The Duke of Edinburgh is pictured leading tributes at Ypres by the Mirror, which reports on Dorothy Ellis - "the last surviving widow of a First World War soldier" - laying a wreath at the National Memorial Arboretum. Meanwhile, the Daily Mail tells of the "revenge" of former Royal Navy engineer Fiona Laing. She marched up to Lib Dem former Armed Forces Minister Sir Nick Harvey in front of dignitaries at a remembrance event in Devon and gave him £7.20 - the sum he had reclaimed on expenses for attending an Armistice Day event two years ago. In Westminster, the issues of class and social mobility are still provoking comment in the wake of a speech by former Prime Minister Sir John Major bemoaning the dominance of the "private-school-educated elite" and "affluent middle class" in British public life. The Independent prints a cartoon depicting Sir John as a Dennis the Menace-type figure pulling up his trousers while fleeing from David Cameron, who's left staring ruddy-cheeked into a fragrant top hat. But Rachel Sylvester, in the Times, argues the PM's predecessor spoke out of concern for the direction of his party, its image and its electoral chances at a time when Labour are putting out populist messages, rather than disloyalty. "Sir John is not trying to cause trouble for David Cameron, he is trying to save his party from itself," she concludes. However, Dan Hodges, in the Telegraph, says Sir John should know better. "If you listen hard, the demand for social mobility is a shrill and empty one," he writes. "The reality is, mobility in education is moving in one direction. Upwards." The Sun puts it bluntly in its leader column: "We don't care which school our politicians went to." Pointing out that both NHS founder Clement Attlee and ex-Labour PM Tony Blair were public schoolboys, it adds: "The Sun has a far stronger objection to the modern generation of politicians who arrive fresh from university for lifelong careers as advisers, MPs and cabinet ministers." The Telegraph is among the papers highlighting figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggesting 57% of its members have reported price rises during the month since the government extended its Help to Buy scheme. Concerns over a house price bubble are raised by the Independent under the headline: "More evidence of a property boom (and why it's a bad news story)". It quotes an Institute of Directors economist saying: "What the housing market needs is help to supply, not help to buy." Still, according to the paper's own economics editor Ben Chu, talk of a property bubble is misplaced. "There are such entrenched structural constraints on the supply of new homes in Britain... and such strong demand for property... that an imminent collapse of values is an unlikely prospect." There is certainly no sign of prices plummeting in Bantham, south Devon, where the entire seaside village has been put up for sale for £10m by the family that owns the estate. The Guardian describes the village - with its thatched cottages and sandy beach - as one of the most unspoilt places in south-west England. One tenant, who runs the village shop, tells the Daily Express: "There is huge uncertainty and anxiety in the village, with many of us worrying about whether we will lose our homes." Practically all the papers indulge in some light relief, courtesy of David Dimbleby and his new tattoo, and most seem incredulous that the Question Time host could indulge in body art at the age of 75. The Daily Mirror's front page invites readers to "see what he had done... on page 7" before revealing the presenter's scorpion design. But it can't resist asking why he bothered. While the paper quotes Dimbleby saying it wasn't painful, its online report suggests he may have "squeaked a little". The Sun enjoys a bit of fun, mocking up a speech bubble quoting Dimbleby as saying: "I'll take a question... but I don't want any needle". Meanwhile, the Daily Mail wonders whether he doesn't look "a little wary" as the artist goes to work in the publicity photo. The Mail notes that getting inked has hitherto hardly been a "rite of passage" for BBC broadcasters. And its coverage sits alongside another story that contradicts stereotypes, headlined: "The middle class shoplifting spree." Gammon joints, parmesan and coffee are now among the items most frequently stolen from the high street "as middle Britain goes shoplifting to maintain its lifestyle", the paper reports. It quotes the latest Global Retail Theft Barometer report as saying: "Really, there is no longer a typical person described as a shoplifter. They can come from all walks of life." And the Daily Mirror has probably the most unusual front page story of the day. It reports how Briton Dougie Thomson was playing golf in Mexico when he was bitten by a 12-foot crocodile. He said he was playing a bunker shot when the croc latched its jaws onto his thigh. Apparently, Dougie's mates halted the attack by smacking the predator with clubs and running it over with a buggy. </body>

      <title>Davey: Energy users 'not cash cows'</title>
      <description>Gas and electricity customers should not be "cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say.</description>

      <body>Gas and electricity customers are "not just cash cows" to be "squeezed" to create bigger profits for shareholders, Energy Secretary Ed Davey will say. In a speech later, the Liberal Democrat minister will call on the industry to "open up your books" to show how it is trying to minimise tariffs. Millions of customers face price rises for gas and electricity this winter. But industry body Energy UK complained that a "tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults" was developing. Four of the UK's six main energy companies have recently announced price rises, with an average increase of 9.1%, and the other two are expected to follow suit soon. The firms say the rises are largely due to increasing wholesale prices, but critics say they are unfair and will lead households into difficulties with bills. In September, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015, should his party win the next election. He has accused the coalition of doing too little to help keep tariffs down. But the government has launched a competition review and will review green and social charges, responsible for some of the cost of bills. In his speech to the annual conference of Energy UK, which represents the industry, in London on Tuesday, Mr Davey will argue that companies need to make enough money to invest in greener technologies. He will add: "But those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poorest in our society. Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. "Trust between those who supply energy and those who use it is breaking down. "It is so difficult for people to work out what exactly they are paying for that they fear the big energy companies are taking them for a ride when bills go up." Mr Davey will say: "Fair or not, they look at the big suppliers and they see a reflection of the greed that consumed the banks." He will tell companies: "You deliver an essential public service, so your industry must serve the public - and the public must have trust in what you do." Mr Davey will say the government is looking at how to reduce the impact of its policies on bills, adding: "But our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own costs to make bills as low as possible." He will also tell industry leaders they face a "Fred the Shred" moment, in reference to the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood after leading the bank to near-collapse in 2008. But Labour's shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said: "David Cameron's out-of-touch government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis." "Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. "It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say." Energy UK, meanwhile, said the industry was "already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter". "The best way to do this is for everyone to work together, which is why this tit-for-tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive," a spokesman said. "The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer. "As analysis from UBS shows, about 95% of rising energy costs are out of the hands of the energy companies and can be attributed to government policies and other network, social and environmental costs." </body>

      <title>'Openness needed' on Whitehall deals</title>
      <description>Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a "crisis of confidence", the National Audit office warns.</description>

      <body>Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a "crisis of confidence", the National Audit Office has warned. Firms such as Serco, Capita, G4S and Atos were being paid hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it said. But the spending watchdog urged more punishments - such as fines and exclusions from future contracts - where "problems" were reported. The government said it was working to create better value for money. The National Audit Office (NAO) has published two reports looking at major public service contracts. It said Serco's were worth £1.8bn, including £611m with the Ministry of Defence and £382m with local government. Capita's totalled £1.08bn, while those for G4S and Atos were £718m and £683m respectively. The NAO said the Cabinet Office, which oversees much of central government, often lacked "commercial experience and expertise below senior levels", and information on its 40 strategic suppliers was "inconsistent and incomplete". The public sector profit margins for Serco appeared to be between 0% and 9%, between 1% and 10% for Capita, and between 3% and 22% for Atos. G4S made an overall loss on some of its public sector contracts last year, giving an overall return ranging from -8% to 16%. The reports mentioned continuing investigations into issues with contractors, including the Ministry of Justice looking at the way G4S and Serco had billed it for electronic tag monitoring. The NAO said: "Transparency is needed to ensure that no-one within the contractor can hide problems and that it is in the contractors' commercial interest to focus on their client's (the government's) needs." Companies would "likely concentrate on maintaining shareholder value", it said, adding: "Government needs to ensure that it is in the contractors' financial interests to focus their control environment more widely on meeting the standards expected of public service. "This involves using contractual entitlements to information, audit and inspection to ensure standards are being met. "And it is likely to involve financial penalties, banning from competitions and political fallout when problems are found." NAO head Amyas Morse said there was "a crisis of confidence at present, caused by some worrying examples of contractors not appearing to treat the public sector fairly, and of departments themselves not being on top of things." He added: "While some government departments have been admirably quick off the mark and transparent in investigating problems, there is a clear need to reset the ground rules for both contractors and their departmental customers." A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "Last year alone we saved taxpayers £3.8bn from our commercial reforms, including renegotiating contracts with our largest suppliers, and we welcome the NAO's recognition of our achievements. "Since the general election we have made it easier for smaller businesses to work with Whitehall and many more are winning contracts." He added: "We know that the civil service lacks commercial capability and that contract management needs to be improved. "Our reform programme seeks to address this but we must accelerate change to save taxpayers more, create better quality public services and promote growth." </body>

      <title>PM to lead trade delegation to China</title>
      <description>Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a trade delegation to China next month, he tells an audience in the City of London.</description>

      <body>David Cameron is to lead a delegation of ministers and business figures to China next month, he has announced. The move represents a warming of relations after a dispute over the PM's decision to meet the Dalai Lama in May. And it comes a month after the chancellor, George Osborne, fronted a business delegation to China. Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement, which sets out the UK government's tax and spending proposals, has been put back 24 hours to accommodate the trip. It will now take place on 5 December, the Treasury said. The prime minister announced the trade visit during his annual speech to the Guildhall in the City of London where he also announced increased UK aid to the typhoon-hit Philippines. Mr Cameron, who has visited China once since he entered Number 10, said the delegation would depart in early December. "I will take senior British ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector, large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples," he said. The trip would help British companies tap into China's "vast and varied markets" he said, adding: "This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come." Earlier this year it was reported the prime minister had been barred from the country by Chinese officials. They reacted angrily when Mr Cameron met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. At the time, the PM's spokesman said he planned to visit the country later in the year. The December trip would be the UK government's second attempt in as many months to improve economic links with China. In October the chancellor announced a relaxation of visa restrictions for Chinese visitors and moves to allow Chinese companies to invest in British nuclear power stations. Giving his annual address to the Lord Mayor's banquet, the PM also said he wanted to encourage more investors from the Gulf with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors. He added that the "global economy" was not a "zero sum game". "As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, 'will they be the winners and we be the losers?' I believe we need to say a very firm 'No',". </body>

      <description>A group of leading UK aid charities launches an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon Haiyan.</description>

      <body>UK aid charities have launched an appeal to help victims of the devastating Philippines typhoon. The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) said it was already responding but there was still a desperate need for water, food and emergency shelter. It will make a televised appeal on Tuesday evening. Earlier David Cameron announced an increase in UK aid. Typhoon Haiyan is feared to have killed up to 10,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The DEC, a group of 14 leading UK aid organisations, said the relief effort was being severely hampered by roads made impassable and airports closed by the typhoon. "The destruction in Tacloban city, on the east coast, is said to be reminiscent of the Boxing Day tsunami," the committee's chief executive Saleh Saeed said. "There is currently no food, water or electricity. We can only imagine how much worse the situation will be for families living in towns and remote villages. "DEC members are doing all they can to get aid through but they need a huge injection of funds in order to do so. The priorities are getting food, water and shelter to people in desperate need." UK broadcasters the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, Channel 5 and other outlets will show the appeal following early evening news programmes. The DEC comprises the charities Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said there was a danger that if enough aid was not delivered quickly it would be pregnant women and children who missed out. "All the organisations - Save the Children, Oxfam, all the others, the United Nations - are there ready to help," he said. "We need to land the planes, we need to offload them and then we need to get aid to people." Meanwhile the UK government said it was increasing its aid to the country from £6m to £10m. The money will pay for aid flights to Cebu in the east of the country, the delivery of temporary shelters, blankets and water purification tablets and sanitation equipment for 300k people. Mr Cameron has also announced that the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Darling will soon head to the disaster zone from Singapore. It would take five days to arrive but once in the Philippines brings engineering and first aid expertise as well as the use of a Lynx helicopter. The ship also carries equipment to make drinking water from sea water. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu. Among other states to have pledged aid are Australia, Aus$9m (£5.8m) and New Zealand, NZ$2.15m (£1.1m). China, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, the US, Vietnam, European Commission and the UN have also announced support. The aid effort comes after a state of "national calamity" was announced by Philippines President Benigno Aquino. On Friday one of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Reports on Monday said 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected - with many now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. </body>

      <title>Heseltine: HS2 is 'an act of faith'</title>
      <description>Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine is due to come out strongly in favour of the HS2 north-south rail project.</description>

      <body>The UK should have faith in the £50bn HS2 rail project, a senior Tory and former deputy prime minister will urge. Lord Heseltine is to warn that future generations would judge those in power today harshly if they failed to deliver the new north-south line. He will call for the project to be "accelerated" and say the private sector should bear more of the costs. Ministers argue HS2 will boost the UK's economic prospects and slash journey times to and from London. But the senior Conservative is expected to say in a speech later that the project is about more than that. "HS2 is about our country's competitiveness for a half century or more. "It is about so many more people sharing growth that has, for too long, been concentrated on London and the south east." Lord Heseltine, author of a report on economic growth for the government, will cast doubt on some of the cost-benefit analyses carried out so far for the project. In a speech to the Royal Town Planning Institute, he is due to say: "Let me leave the ladies and gentlemen of the slide rules. They know no more and no less than you and me." He will say that no-one is "asking what might happen" but, referring to his period in charge of regeneration in under Margaret Thatcher, is expected to add: "I tell you frankly, I don't know either. I didn't know in east London in 1979 but I believed. "All over the world governments are making decisions about a future which they cannot predict but in which they believe." A recent report by KPMG suggested the new line could be worth £15bn to the UK economy - with Greater London and the West Midlands the biggest beneficiaries. The accountants behind the report and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin are due to appear before MPs to defend their economic justifications for the railway. Lord Heseltine will tell his audience costs must be kept down but that not going ahead presented risks for the UK. "The cost of dither, doubt and delay. The cost of standing still while our competitors move ahead. "If we hadn't built Canary Wharf, how many of the jobs there would be in Frankfurt instead?" he will ask. But he will add that Sir David Higgins, incoming chairman of the HS2 Ltd company, "should consult appropriate institutions about the financing of the project in part during construction in order to ensure their participation in the long term concession". HS2 has commanded cross-party support from its inception but Labour appeared to change its tone recently, saying it would not give the project a "blank cheque". However Lord Heseltine will warn sceptics: "Not many of those in power to make decisions will be around to judge the world of the HS2 but others of younger generations will judge us." </body>

      <title>Call for terror relocation powers</title>
      <description>The home secretary should get back the power to forcibly relocate terror suspects to different parts of the country, Labour argues.</description>

      <body>The home secretary should be able to relocate terror suspects to another part of the country, Labour says. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for the powers to be brought back after a man under a government order restricting his movements absconded disguised in a burka last week and has not been seen since. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure (TPim). Labour say TPims watered down controls. It has been reported that the government is reviewing the measures which were introduced last year and replaced the much more restrictive control orders. Ms Cooper has written to Theresa May, urging her to re-introduce previously available powers to forcibly move suspects around the country. She said Ms May could face allegations of a U-turn but pledged to support the government "on a cross-party basis" if it brought back the relocation powers. Mr Mohamed, allegedly linked to Somali militant group al-Shabab, disappeared from a west London mosque last week. He had been relocated to Ipswich when subject to a control order but moved back to London when the restriction was lifted. This followed the case of Ibrahim Magag - also under a TPim - who went on the run last Boxing Day. "No terror suspect under a relocation order ever managed to abscond," Ms Cooper wrote to the home secretary. "Now two terror suspects who were previously relocated and then returned because of your decision have absconded. "Your decision, against advice and warnings, to end relocations has made it much easier for two dangerous men to disappear." Labour made the call as MPs prepare to question independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson QC and Charles Farr, director general for security and counter-terrorism. Ahead of the home affairs select committee meeting on Tuesday the party urged Ms May to apologise for "increasing the risk to public safety". "Will you now accept that the decision to end relocations was a very serious error of judgement and has led directly to two out of the ten terror suspects on TPims now absconding?" Ms Cooper wrote. Missing Mr Mohamed, 27, was already facing 20 charges for allegedly breaching the conditions of a TPim and of an earlier control order. </body>

      <title>MP Dorries apologises over TV fees</title>
      <description>Tory MP Nadine Dorries apologises for failing to properly register income she made from her appearance on I'm A Celebrity.</description>

      <body>Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has apologised to MPs for failing to properly register income made from her appearance on I'm A Celebrity in 2012. Ms Dorries said the breach of the rules had been "inadvertent" but she owed MPs a "full and unreserved apology". She cited a confidentiality clause and the fact the fees were paid to a firm of which she was a shareholder for not declaring the outside earnings. But the standards committee said she must apologise. The standards commissioner also criticised the MP for Mid-Bedfordshire for not co-operating with their inquiry, saying this amounted to a "serious breach" of the MPs' code of conduct. However, it said it believed that the MP's failure to register her financial interest as a shareholder in the Averbrook media consultancy until June 2013 was "inadvertent" rather than deliberate. The standards committee of MPs, which has the power to sanction members in light of the commissioner's findings, said the MP should make a "personal statement" to the House to apologise. The MP lost the Conservative whip when she appeared on I'm A Celebrity in 2012 but Ms Dorries said she succeeded in communicating her views to a wider audience and her constituents had continued to be represented while she was in Australia, where the show is filmed. The issue of Ms Dorries' income from TV appearances, including the ITV show, was referred to the watchdog earlier this year following a complaint by Labour MP John Mann. The watchdog found she had not recorded details of eight separate media appearances on six different programmes in the register of MPs financial interests. If the MP had been paid for any of these appearances, the watchdog said it would represent a breach of the rules - requiring MPs to disclose time spent on their outside employment and the amount of money they make. "The omissions from Ms Dorries' entry means that constituents, other members and the wider public do not have access to this information in her case," the commissioner said. "The omissions also have the potential to undermine public confidence in the completeness and accuracy of the register." In a letter to the committee last month, the MP said she "unequivocally never sought to impede" the inquiry in any way. "In respect of both the code and guidance there is unfortunately an ambiguity, which fails to make clear to members their responsibilities in terms of the declaration of outside interests and contractual obligations," she added. Ms Dorries updated her entry on the register in October. It showed Averbrook's turnover for the previous year was £142,000, yielding a profit of £82,000. It also showed Ms Dorries took a £10,000 dividend at the end of the month. Ms Dorries told the standards committee that if she disclosed how much she had been paid by ITV she would "fall foul" of the contract's confidentiality clause but the MPs said requirements to provide information to Parliament "overrode" confidentiality agreements. The MPs said the disciplinary system in the Commons "depended on members being prepared to explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary, to respond to the commissioner's inquiries". "We recommend that Ms Dorries register all payments in respect of her employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook or any other third party and apologise to the House by way of a personal statement." It also said the MP should seek advice from officials about her entries in the register before the end of the month and her future compliance with the rules would be monitored. The MP had the whip restored in May and was recently re-adopted as the Conservative candidate to fight the next general election in her constituency. </body>

      <body>Former Tomorrow's World presenter Maggie Philbin is to lead a Labour-backed taskforce on developing young people's digital skills. Party leader Ed Miliband will say in a speech that the UK is falling behind on IT and the government is "letting down" businesses and the workforce. Ms Philbin said she was "completely independent" of party politics. Her aim was to encourage "brilliant young people", she added. Ms Philbin, who is chief executive of TeenTech, which arranges science career visits for schoolchildren, presented the BBC's Tomorrow's World, the science and technology programme which ran from 1965 to 2003. She also presented BBC children's show Swap Shop. She said: "I am delighted to be leading this digital skills taskforce on how Britain might encourage our brilliant young people to develop the skills of the future. "Britain has led the world in new technologies for decades but we need to make sure we do everything to maintain that success by training and developing the talents that our country needs. "I would like to emphasise that this is a completely independent piece of work which will be shared with all political parties to inform future policies as they see fit." During his speech, Mr Miliband will say skills are essential to enable the UK to "earn our way out of the cost-of-living crisis, rebuild our economy for the future, and ensure all working people can enjoy the prosperity they deserve". The government says Labour would increase borrowing, reducing prosperity, and that recent improvements to the economy will help households. </body>

      <title>'Strong start' for Help to Buy</title>
      <description>Royal Bank of Scotland and Halifax report a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme.</description>

      <body>Two major lenders have reported a strong uptake in the first month of the government's extended Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Halifax said they had received a total of 2,384 applications, potentially worth £365m in mortgages. The scheme is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages with deposits as low as 5%. But critics are concerned it could help to create a UK housing bubble. RBS and its subsidiary NatWest, and Halifax - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - are among the few lenders to offer mortgages under the government's extended scheme. HSBC and Barclays are planning to offer such mortgages in the future, but Nationwide, the UK's second largest lender, has not yet made a decision. The first phase of Help to Buy was launched in April, but only provided help to first-time buyers buying new-build homes. The extended scheme applies to all buyers and all types of homes, up to a value of £600,000. Under this part of the scheme, up to 15% of the value of the loan will be guaranteed by the Treasury. RBS said it had so-far approved 169 of its 1,075 applications, and five customers had already completed their purchases. It said the majority of applications had come from young couples with a joint salary of less than £50,000. The average price of the property being bought was £167,565. Unlike the first part of the Help to Buy Scheme, part two also offers help to existing home owners. However, Halifax said more than 80% of the applications it had received under the scheme were from first-time buyers, while RBS/NatWest said it was 73%. RBS said the majority of applications had come from outside London and the south-east of England, where property prices are rising fastest. It also said that five purchases had so far been completed. The government welcomed the figures, saying the scheme was supporting "responsible lending", helping borrowers who could afford mortgage repayments, but not a large deposit. "Four weeks in and its clear that Help to Buy is already delivering," said Prime Minister David Cameron. "Most Help to Buy applicants are first-time buyers, young and have a roughly average household income. This is all about helping hardworking people get on the first rung of the property ladder." But critics have expressed concern that the scheme could create a bubble in the housing market, making home affordability an even bigger problem. Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: "If the government was serious about helping first-time buyers they would also be bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes. "Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this government house building is at its lowest level since the 1920s," he said. Labour says that the Bank of England should review the scheme immediately, rather than waiting for a year. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest average house prices in the UK are at a record level. Other measures suggest house prices and housing transactions are well short of the pre-crisis peak. Figures from Halifax suggest house prices are well below what they were in 2007, but have risen steadily for the last nine consecutive months. The Nationwide Building Society says prices are currently 5.8% higher than a year ago. But estate agents argue that much of those price rises are seen in London and the south-east of England, while prices in other parts of the country are rising more slowly, or in some cases actually falling. The housebuilder Redrow reported that 35% of its sales since June have been under the first part of the government's Help to Buy scheme. </body>

      <body>Britain will be forced to end its long-term military commitment to Afghanistan unless its government signs a security agreement with international forces, the defence secretary has warned. Philip Hammond made his comments ahead of an official ceremony to open an officer training academy in Kabul. Mr Hammond said British trainers could only stay if they were given immunity from prosecution under Afghan law. Most Nato troops will leave the country by the end of 2014. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Hammond said: "Without those agreements we can't do anything because we won't be able to protect our own people and clearly if we can't protect our own people we won't be able to have them here." Discussions are already under way with the US on a bilateral security agreement that would allow American troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond 2014. If that is approved other Nato countries, including the UK, will sign a separate agreement. The first recruits are already being trained at the academy which has been largely created and funded by the UK. The academy will be Britain's main military contribution to Afghanistan after 2014. The ceremony was also was attended by Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Mr Hammond said: "Modelled on the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, this academy will provide world-class training. "It will teach the importance of leadership, of self-reliance, of personal discipline, of dedication and of service to fellow soldiers. "This will help ensure the Afghan officers and those training them will be of the highest quality, helping sustain the progress made in building a capable and professional force." Mr Hammond also attended a remembrance service at the British base at Camp Bastion while in Afghanistan. </body>

      <title>Private school clout 'shocks' Major</title>

      <body>The influence that a privately educated, middle-class elite have on public life is "shocking", former prime minister Sir John Major has said. Sir John said the "upper echelons of power" were dominated by those from a similar background. In a speech to Tory activists reported in the Daily Telegraph he blamed "the collapse in social mobility" on the failures of the last Labour government. More than half the current cabinet were educated at private schools. David Cameron was educated at Eton, as was the Mayor of London Boris Johnson and the Archbishop of Canterbury The Right Reverend Justin Welby. Nick Clegg attended Westminster while George Osborne and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman went to St Paul's. In contrast, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - grew up in Brixton and left his grammar school with three O-levels. In a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association's annual dinner, he bemoaned what he said was the lack of people from working and lower middle class backgrounds in positions of influence in British institutions. "In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class," he said. "To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking." Sir John said the Labour government, in power between 1997 and 2010, had left a legacy of a "Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration" which current leader Ed Miliband was in no position to address. Too many children, he added, were "locked into the circumstances in which they were born" as a result of a lack of educational opportunities. He added: "I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost... we need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. "And it is not going to happen magically." Sir John also called for more help for savers, who have seen their incomes eroded by "cripplingly unfair" low interest rates since 2008. He urged the Bank of England to raise interest rates to "normal levels", which he suggested were between 3% and 5%, as soon as was economically feasible. He also advised his party against "personal attacks" on UKIP, suggesting many of their supporters were natural Conservatives who were "patriotic Britons" who felt "bewildered" by the pace of social change. The speech is his second intervention in contemporary politics in a matter of weeks, after his call earlier this month for a windfall tax on energy profits in the event of a harsh winter and a warning about hidden "lace curtain poverty". The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said he did not believe the comments were an attack on the current Conservative leadership but a plea for those from modest backgrounds to have more say in public life. The former prime minister, Nick Robinson added, was speaking up for what he regarded as his party's natural constituency, the hard-working but aspiring majority who were not well-off. Downing Street rejected any suggestions of a rift with Sir John, saying Mr Cameron spoke to his predecessor "pretty regularly". And the prime minister said initiatives such as the help-to-buy scheme - which is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5% on homes worth up to £600,000 - was all about promoting social mobility. Figures show 2,384 people, the majority first-time buyers, have applied for loans under the scheme in its first month. "Without this help to buy, we were beginning to see a country where only people who had wealthy mums and dads, who could give them the money for the deposit were able to buy a flat or a house," Mr Cameron said. For Labour, Kevin Brennan, shadow schools minister, said Sir John was "telling people what they already knew", saying the government was "out of touch" with "the next generation being locked out of opportunity". The UK Independence Party said the Conservatives were as much to blame as Labour for the social and educational imbalance at the top of British institutions. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: "The abolition of selective education in Britain has been a hammer blow to the prospects of working class kids. Until we see a grammar school back in every town and city across the UK, Britain's shocking lack of social mobility will go on." </body>

      <title>Jury hears David Blunkett voicemails</title>
      <description>The phone-hacking trial hears recordings of messages in which David Blunkett expresses anger over false press claims about his relationship with a female friend.</description>

      <body>Angry messages left by Labour MP David Blunkett over false claims about his relationship with a female friend have been played in the phone-hacking trial. In one, he said he hoped whoever had leaked information would "rot in hell". Ten messages from 2005, left for Sally Anderson, were found at the home of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who admits phone hacking. The court also heard an ex-aide was "puzzled" at how much the News of the World knew of Mr Blunkett's activities. In one message played out to jurors, Mr Blunkett said: "Someone very, very close has done a really phenomenal piece of work on destroying both our lives at this moment in time and it's vile. "Whoever it is I hope they rot in hell." At the time, Mr Blunkett, the MP for Sheffield, was work and pensions minister. He also served as home secretary in the Labour government. It is claimed that the messages were illegally accessed by Mulcaire on behalf of journalists at the now-closed tabloid, the News of the World. In one message, Mr Blunkett warned Ms Anderson to start thinking about who might have passed information to the media. He said: "I do think that someone has done a pretty good stitch-up job, chapter and verse, times, places, everything. That's pretty sophisticated to say the least." In another message, Mr Blunkett said: "The hyenas are still trying to get me but when I'm back I will shed a little light and they will all run back into the jungle again." Mr Blunkett's statement says part of one of his intercepted voicemails to Ms Anderson was "produced verbatim" in the Sunday People newspaper. He successfully sued over incorrect reports that he had an affair with her. In a statement, Ms Anderson said she was followed to the US by a News of the World reporter who was pursuing a story on her relationship with Mr Blunkett. She said the reporter Rob Kellaway sat near her on the plane and later offered her £150,000 for her story. She said: "I couldn't work out how he knew how to find us." The court heard that Mulcaire's notes on Ms Anderson included details on her father, other family and friends and her osteopath's number. The jury also heard that she approached the publicist Max Clifford, who arranged for the Sunday People to listen to her voicemails. She says she cannot remember how much she was paid. She was sued by Mr Blunkett and had to issue a public apology in March 2006. The court then heard from Mr Blunkett's former special adviser, Huw Evans, who said he frequently spoke to the then home secretary on mobile phones and used voicemails, but knew calls could be intercepted. "We were very careful if we were having a conversation on a mobile to stick to a general subject or use coded language," he said. He then described a conversation with then News of the World editor Andy Coulson over a story the paper planned to run in 2004 about the politician's affair with former Spectator publisher Kimberly Quinn. Mr Evans said he believed all they had was a photograph of the pair together - so asked Mr Coulson why the evidence he claimed to have was substantive enough to run such a major story. He said: "I told him that the photograph in itself proved nothing. I remember the tone of his voice... it was flat, unequivocal, that he was absolutely certain that the story was true and he was going to run it. I remember at that time remaining puzzled as to why he could be so certain." Timothy Langdale QC, representing Mr Coulson, suggested Mr Evans had stood up the story during that conversation, which he denied. Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiracy to intercept communications and conspiracy to commit misconduct. The jury heard Mr Evans believed 13 people, including media advisers, knew of Mr Blunkett's affair with Ms Quinn. Of the story's merit, he said: "I can understand why it was considered a story. I didn't consider then and I don't consider now that it was in the public interest to expose it. It was a private relationship." The court heard Mr Blunkett and Ms Quinn had been on holiday together in 2003 and 2004, and attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in 2003. In a police statement, Mr Evans said: "They were hiding in plain sight. I always thought that it was a matter of time before someone worked it out." Later, prosecutors told the jury that model Abi Titmuss, who had a relationship with former TV presenter John Leslie, had her phone hacked by Mulcaire. They were told Mulcaire had a note of her phone number and the phrase "do them both" was written on his note about Mr Leslie. The defence counsel said, however, there was no evidence in those notes that Mr Leslie's phone was hacked. In a police statement, Mr Leslie, said the year 2002 was a "traumatic time in my life" and the intense media interest in him only abated three or four years later when he moved to Scotland and stopped working in TV. The trial continues. </body>

      <title>Iran differences narrow, says Hague</title>
      <description>The differences preventing Western countries reaching a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme are now "narrow", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague says.</description>

      <body>The differences preventing Western countries reaching a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme are now "narrow", William Hague has said. The UK foreign secretary added that, although talks at the weekend had not resulted in agreement, some "gaps" had been "bridged altogether". Iran and the UK have announced that diplomatic visits between the countries will take place later this month. Sanctions would remain in place until a firm deal was in place, Mr Hague said. His statement to the House of Commons came after US Secretary of State John Kerry said Iran had backed out of a deal to freeze expansion of its nuclear activity in return for limited relief from international sanctions. The Geneva talks involved Iran and the P5+1: the US, Russia, the UK, France and China as permanent UN Security Council members, plus Germany. Mr Hague told MPs the aim was to produce an interim agreement before moving on to a fuller deal, but that "some differences" between the parties remained after discussions on Friday and Saturday. However, he added: "Most of these gaps are now narrow and many others were bridged altogether during the discussions." Mr Hague said he was confident of further progress at the next round of meetings, starting on 20 November, and there had been "a substantial step towards a comprehensive settlement". Sanctions against Iran were causing its economy to lose $4bn a month and would remain in place until a full agreement, he added. Mr Hague also said: "We are determined to reach a diplomatic settlement to the Iran nuclear crisis." Iran and the UK agreed to renew direct diplomatic links during talks over the state's nuclear ambitions last month. The UK's new charge d'affaires for Iran, Ajay Sharma, was named on Monday. He is expected to visit the country later this month, as efforts to improve relations continue. Iran has also named its charge d'affaires, Mohammad Hassan Habibollah, who will come London "in the near future to examine the situation of Iran's possessions and buildings in Britain and to improve consular activities", according to the foreign ministry. Mr Sharma, former head of the Foreign Office's Iran department, said: "I am delighted to take up this appointment at this important time in the UK's relations with Iran. I am very much looking forward to renewing direct UK contact with the Iranian government and society. "This is very much in the interests of both our countries. I hope to make my first visit to Tehran as non-resident charge later this month." The UK shut down its Tehran embassy in 2011 after it was stormed in a protest over sanctions imposed because of its nuclear programme. Iran says its uranium-enrichment is for energy-creation purposes, rather then weapons. Significant progress is believed to have been made on a deal after Hassan Rouhani, perceived as a moderate, was elected president this summer, despite the weekend's disappointments. Asked about the prospects of agreement, Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman said "it can be done", despite requiring "formidably difficult negotiation". </body>

      <body>Veteran TV broadcaster David Dimbleby has revealed he has got his first tattoo - a scorpion on his shoulder. In a Radio Times interview, the 75-year-old Question Time host said: "You are only old once. I have always wanted a tattoo. "I thought I might as well have it done now. It's a dream come true for me," he added. Dimbleby got the tattoo while making the maritime series, Britain and the Sea, due to be aired later this month. During filming, Dimbleby was given the chance to have a tattoo of his own while looking into how body art was introduced to the UK as a result of Captain Cook's South Sea adventures. He turned down the offer and had a black pencil mark put on his body, but changed his mind when he saw a preview of the film. "I thought it was wimpish having it just drawn on and I needed to man up," he said. Dimbleby, who has been the BBC's main presenter of election coverage since 1979, was then accompanied to an east London tattoo studio by a cameraman. "It took about 30 minutes - an hour in all - and I thought of Winston Churchill having his done while mine was being done. It wasn't painful at all, it just zings a bit." The tattoo, on his right shoulder, was discreet, modest and represented his star sign, Scorpio, he said. Of singer Cheryl Cole, who has roses tattooed all over her bottom, he said: "I wasn't tempted to have any private parts decorated, I have to tell you." His wife, Belinda, was, he added, "mildly amused" by it but might be persuaded to have one of her own. </body>

      <body>A Sinn Féin lord mayor has attended an Armistice Day ceremony for the first time in the party's history. Máirtin Ó Muilleoir took part in an event in Belfast commemorating the end of World War One. He said he had taken the decision as he wanted to show "respect to the unionist tradition". Meanwhile, in Dublin men and women were on parade dressed in the historical uniforms of the Ulster Volunteer Force at the time of the Home Rule crisis. The event at Glasnevin cemetery was aimed at promoting and explaining unionist culture and history among people in the Republic of Ireland. In Belfast, the anniversary of the World War One armistice - signed 95 years ago - was marked at the city hall with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. In recent years, Sinn Féin's representatives paid their respects before remembrance ceremonies but did not attend the actual events. The new move followed discussions between the Sinn Féin lord mayor and the Royal British Legion, the Belfast Telegraph reported. "When I was appointed I said I would be the mayor for all the city," Mr Ó Muilleoir told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. "Today, for me, was showing respect to the unionist tradition. I know that remembrance - Armistice Day in particular - in the unionist tradition is a crucial part of their heritage in this city," he added. "I wanted to find a way, to use the words of my chaplain, which was imaginative and generous, in that I could take part in a remembrance ceremony. "And I think we did that - the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, that I was able to stand at the Royal British Legion ceremony at city hall." Mr Ó Muilleoir attended the ceremony shortly after returning from a visit to Canada. His senior party colleague, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, described the Belfast mayor's attendance at the British Legion ceremony as "admirable leadership". Mr McGuinness wrote "respect, reaching out essential" on his Twitter account. "I'm not the first, of course, mayor from my tradition to acknowledge the terrible loss and slaughter of the First World War," Mr Ó Muilleoir told Talkback. "Alex Maskey laid a wreath on the Somme anniversary during his tenure. Tom Hartley spoke often about trying to make Remembrance Day and remembrance more inclusive, because many people in this city feel that remembrance isn't part of their tradition because they are nationalist." More than 1,000 people gathered in the garden of remembrance at the city hall on Monday. President of the Royal British Legion, Mervyn Elder, met the lord mayor and walked with him to the cenotaph. They paused briefly before observing the two-minute silence. This year, Armistice Day, which honours members of the armed forces who have died in war, comes a day after Remembrance Sunday. On Sunday, two-minute silences took place at war memorials across the UK and the Commonwealth. Monday's silence took place at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month - the time the guns fell silent along the Western Front in 1918, and an armistice was declared. Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt welcomed Mr Ó Muilleoir's attendance at the event and that of SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell at a service in Parliament Buildings. "I consider these gestures important at a time when a generosity of spirit will be required from all political leaders, if we are to succeed in our current efforts to reach agreement on the difficult issues under consideration in the Haass talks process," Mr Nesbitt said. In Dublin, the largest collection of UVF memorabilia gathered together in one place was on display. The fact that it was at the burial ground for some of Ireland's best-known republicans showed the unique nature of the occasion. The Ulster Volunteer Force was formed to resist plans to make Ireland self-governing, but many members went on to fight in the First World War. The exhibition is called Home Rule Crisis... the unionist response and covers the period from 1912-1914. It was officially opened by the Irish Minister for Arts and Heritage Jimmy Deenihan. As well as those involved in historical re-enactments of the UVF, a number of unionist politicians were also at the north Dublin event. A priest read prayers before people in UVF costumes laid wreaths at the war graves commission memorial to those from the Republic who died fighting for the allies in the two world wars. </body>

      <body>An MSP whose daughter died from anorexia has called on retailers to use larger sized fashion mannequins to help tackle eating disorders. Debenhams announced last week it would introduce a size 16 dummy to reflect the size of many of its customers. SNP MSP Dennis Robertson will use his Member's Debate to urge other fashion outlets to do the same. He has campaigned on the issue since his 18-year-old daughter Caroline died in 2011. Shop mannequins are usually a size eight or 10. Speaking ahead of the Eating Disorders and the Fashion Industry debate, Mr Robertson said thin mannequins reinforced an unrealistic ideal of body shape and size. The member for Aberdeenshire West added: "Debenhams, through their flagship store in London, are leading the way in the UK on different size mannequins and their summer catalogue also made a display of the diversity in our society. "It is important to celebrate that diversity because young people can be influenced by what they see in shop windows, magazines or adverts and I hope that many more fashion retailers can follow in their footsteps. "I do not feel the sole responsibility lies with medical professionals to tackle the issue of eating disorders, and the media and fashion industry must show some action to ensure that young people especially have positive images of the diverse body shapes and sizes in our society." Equality minister Jo Swinson said last week that the decision by Debenhams to introduce a plus-size mannequin went some way towards tackling the "important" issue of body-confidence that affects some women. </body>

      <title>Small firm lending set for criticism</title>
      <description>Lending to small businesses by an arm of the Welsh government is set to be criticised in an independent report published later.</description>

      <body>Lending to small businesses by an arm of the Welsh government is set to be criticised in an independent report. The second part of a two-stage review, it is expected to question the performance of Finance Wales - the Welsh government's investment company. The first part of the review by Prof Dylan Jones-Evans said there "remains confusion" about its exact role. Plaid Cymru has reiterated its call for the establishment of a new publicly-owned development bank. Commissioned by Economy Minister Edwina Hart, the Access to Finance Review was set-up following concern that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are facing difficulties borrowing money from banks. It has been led by Prof Dylan Jones-Evans, a business expert at the University of the West of England and a former Conservative assembly candidate. Published in June 2013, the first part of the report said decisions on bank lending should be solely made in Wales. It also concluded that 20,000 SMEs in Wales are missing out on the funding they require from banks. There are an estimated 210,700 enterprises active in Wales in 2012, 99% of which are SMEs. Prof Jones-Evans's initial report called on the Welsh government to clarify the role of its investment arm Finance Wales. The report also highlighted business concerns that Finance Wales' interest rates and additional costs were "punitive, especially within an environment where the Bank of England base interest rate has been at its lowest level in history". Finance Wales has justified the interest rate levels as a requirement of EU state aid guidelines. In October the first minister announced that SMEs in enterprise zones will receive a 2% reduction in interest rates charged on new loans from Finance Wales. The second part of Prof Jones-Evans' report, which will be published following a statement by the economy minister in the Senedd on Tuesday, is expected to raise further concerns with the funding agency. Ahead of the report's publication, Plaid Cymru repeated its calls to establish a new publicly-owned, not-for-profit bank to lend money to small businesses. Economy spokesperson Alun Ffred Jones said: "We need a new body, owned by the public but at arm's length from government to lend money to small businesses at competitive rates. "Securing cash flow for businesses, particularly for small businesses is key in creating employment and keeping the wheels of the economy moving. "It is vital that our SMEs are able to access the resources they need in order to operate effectively and to prosper so that the Welsh economy can return to growth," he added. The Welsh Conservatives have previously called for a shake-up of Finance Wales since it thinks its loans are too big for many small firms. They would establish Invest Wales, splitting Wales into six regions where banks or post offices could host the service in the hope that it would make state help more accessible to local businesses. </body>

      <title>Lords quiz energy firms over fracking</title>
      <description>The four bosses of the energy firms hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling give evidence to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee.</description>

      <body>The four bosses of companies hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling in the UK have given evidence to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, IGas Energy CEO Andrew Austin, Tom Crotty, director of INEO, and INEOS gas procurement manager Andrew Mackenzie were questioned on the scope for commercial shale gas extraction by peers on Tuesday. They were also asked which areas were most likely to produce shale gas, and when production might start. Andrew Austin was up first. He said they knew there was an awful lot of gas out there but what they needed to know was whether they could technically recover it and if it could be economical. Then it was the turn of Francis Egan of Cuadrilla. Quietly spoken and calm, you could sense his frustration that, as he put it, the difference between exploration and exploitation was not well understood. He repeatedly said they had not drilled shale at the Balcombe site in West Sussex and no hydraulic fracturing - fracking - had taken place either. Asked if he "could put his hand on his heart and say fracking is completely safe?", he said yes without any hesitation. He also said he could categorically say there was no correlation between fracking and cancers, which was one of the scare stories he'd heard. The point all four made was that the level of scrutiny on shale gas exploration was much higher than for tradition oil and gas and they thought the government needed to help sell the benefits - such as the potential to create anywhere between 25,000 and 100,000 jobs. They said there was the potential to create "another Aberdeen" - potentially in the North West of the country. After the hearing I spoke to the committee chair, Lord McGregor. He was at pains to point out they were not even half way through the inquiry process but said he thought the bosses had made a good case. Lord McGregor also cited the example of the US, where fracking has helped transform the economy and lower utility bills; the energy bosses gave no such assurances on utility bills. Mr Egan said he'd worked in oil and gas all his life and had "never seen an accurate oil price forecast" because the price was controlled by supply and demand. He also said if they didn't explore shale gas and oil opportunities everyone would have to pay higher prices for imported fuel eventually. The bosses estimate the UK's oil and gas is due to run out by about 2030, with Britain then being forced to import supplies from Russia or China at potentially much higher costs and with greater security risks. While the bosses calmly gave evidence to the committee, the No Fracking in Balcombe Society was among a group of campaigners delivering an open letter to the prime minister. They want the government to compensate communities for any fall in house prices or tourism resulting from fracking, and any environmental fallout that affects industries such as farming. The contrast between the way the two groups delivered their arguments brings into sharp focus the deep divisions on both sides of this debate - the need to keep the lights on weighed against the need to protect the environment. Despite the weeks of protests in Balcombe this summer, the energy bosses seemed optimistic the public mood would turn in their favour. Mr Egan said his firm could start drilling tomorrow if it had planning permission. This debate still has some way to go. Next up in front of the committee will be representatives of the Environment Agency and government ministers. And with energy prices under the spotlight like never before the government will be keen to explore all alternative forms of energy supplies. </body>

      <title>City's shipbuilding loss 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose shipbuilding has been described as a "catastrophe".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24833434</url>

      <body>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose its shipbuilding industry has been described as a "catastrophe". About 900 job losses are expected at the BAE yard, which employs about 1,200 people. The site will stay open, with a focus on repairs and maintenance, but there is no prospect of new ships. For the south coast port, which considers itself the home of the Royal Navy, it is a big blow. The city's maritime links are clear for any visitor to see. Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose, HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and the battleship HMS Warrior are proudly displayed in the city's dockyard. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers will be based at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard - which was under threat a few years ago. Losing shipbuilding will be felt far and wide across the Solent region. Many workers said they had been "forbidden" to speak to the media as they left the Portsmouth yard following the announcement. But one, who did not want to be named, described a "bad mood" among staff. "Basically there's about six months work left," he said. "It's not really unexpected, we knew it was coming." Another added: "It's a sad day for the loss of work in the South yet again. "[It's] a political decision for Scotland to have all the work and us have nothing." The mood in Portsmouth earlier matched those of the workers. Derek Brown, who started 40 years of work as a shipwright when he was 15, said: "For years it's been run down but it's unfortunate a lot of people will lose their jobs - people with mortgages and bills to pay. "When I first went in there was 22,000 people working in there. It was a job for life then but times change." Patricia Hawkins added: "Portsmouth will be a ghost town. We'll end up with a museum not a dockyard and what happens when we need ships to go to war again?" Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the news was a "personal tragedy for everyone who's going into work in the yard today". He added: "And that's a personal tragedy for them and a catastrophe for the city of Portsmouth to lose so many highly-skilled jobs which will be virtually impossible to replace in that line. "I think it's a national disgrace that we're going put all their expertise and investment that's gone into the yard in Portsmouth at risk by closing it down and putting all your eggs into one basket." Ian Woodland, South East regional officer for the Unite union, said the news means skilled workers will be left on the "scrap heap". "[The] Tories are clueless about how to deal with BAE job losses in Portsmouth. Where will these people work?," he said. "There are no jobs for these workers. "BAE job losses in Portsmouth will affect [the] whole of Solent area. Many BAE employees [also] live in Southampton." Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, said it would be working with the city council to try and help those affected. "Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city," she added. "It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. "It may not just be one person in one family, with the tradition of shipbuilding here sometimes it's the whole family involved." BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago when it became apparent that future work, following the completion of the new aircraft carriers, was unlikely to sustain yards in Portsmouth as well as Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. And it is Portsmouth that will make way. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <title>Positive signs despite breakdown of Iran nuclear talks</title>
      <description>Iran talks move from success to failure, but hope remains</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24895917</url>
      <date>1384176950</date>

      <body>At the end of last week, with excitement mounting, influential foreign ministers rushed post-haste to Geneva. All the signs were that an important interim deal would be signed between Iran and the P5+1 - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, along with Germany. However, at the last moment somebody applied the brakes. No deal could be reached. There was only agreement to meet again, at a lower level, on 20 November. Amidst the rapid euphoria and almost instantaneous gloom of the news cycle, the Iran nuclear talks moved from success to failure in the blink of an eye. The setback - if that is really what it was - serves, though, as a reality check: underscoring both the nature of the deal that was being discussed and the raft of problems militating against progress. So who cried foul? The finger-pointing has highlighted two possible culprits: France, and the Iranians themselves. Few details of the talks have been revealed - itself probably a good thing if there is to be any agreement. The French, it seems, baulked at the last moment. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius was concerned about two issues: continued construction of Iran's heavy-water reactor at Arak that might eventually give it a plutonium route to a bomb, and the fate of the stock of 20%-enriched uranium that Tehran has already accumulated. France has generally taken a tough line with Tehran. And many commentators have also pointed to the developing commercial ties - especially in the military sector - between Paris and the Gulf. Washington's Gulf Arab allies are as alarmed as Israel at the possibility of what they might see as a poor or weak deal with Tehran, so - some of the pundits suggest - France is seeking to mark out its position from the other Western players. That said, France's views on Iran's nuclear programme have been consistent, its approach to these talks nicely summed up by the comment from Mr Fabius himself suggesting that Paris was "neither isolated nor simply following along" in the negotiations. More generally - and not surprisingly - there has been a denial that the Western camp has been divided, not least from the US Secretary of State John Kerry himself. Speaking in the United Arab Emirates on Monday, Mr Kerry noted that France was as much on board as the other Western players. It was Iran, he said, that "couldn't take it at that particular moment". Mark Hibbs, a Berlin-based nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says that in his view that might be a diplomatic way of minimising the tensions in the Western camp. However, he believes the outcome in Geneva was by no means a fiasco. Not only the French, but others in the Western camp, were uneasy at the sudden breakneck pace of the talks, Mr Hibbs says. As he puts it: "Some of the Europeans were concerned that Washington was moving forward at a pace with which they were not comfortable." In his view, the additional 10 days of reflection before the various parties meet again could be very helpful. Mr Hibbs also argues that the separate agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) just announced in Tehran and confirmed in Vienna - on a framework through which to tackle concerns about Iran's past nuclear activities - is also a positive sign. If there is to be any final agreement between Iran and the P5+1, then not only must the uncertainties of the past be clarified, but a new spirit of co-operation must be established between Iran and the UN's nuclear watchdog. The new deal identifies five specific areas where progress is to be made over the next three months - so there is a built-in mechanism to determine if Iran is playing ball. The delay in the Geneva talks on reaching an interim deal - one that will build confidence and put "more time on the clock" in Secretary Kerry's words - is thus in Mr Hibbs' view no disaster. "We should all remember that we are currently in a place in negotiations with Tehran where we have never been before!" he notes. The mood music, Mr Hibbs clearly believes, should still be seen as positive. </body>

      <description>How UK aid agencies are preparing Philippines relief</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24903192</url>

      <body>A state of national calamity has been declared in the Philippines as relief efforts get under way to ease the plight of thousands of victims of Typhoon Haiyan, which swept across the country on Friday. There has been massive destruction and loss of life, with as many as 10,000 people thought to have died and thousands more left destitute and waiting for relief efforts to reach them. What are the UK Government and aid agencies doing to help? The Department for International Development has pledged urgent humanitarian support for as many as 500,000 people affected by the disaster and has activated the UK's Rapid Response Facility, which provides emergency support via pre-approved organisations in the event of a humanitarian disaster overseas. This includes releasing £5m to partners on the ground so they can provide assistance such as including temporary shelter and access to clean water. The UK is also donating shelter materials, such as plastic sheeting, and household items like kitchen sets and blankets from the UK's stockpile of humanitarian items in Dubai - worth a further £600,000. The government has sent three British humanitarian advisors, who arrived in the Philippines on Saturday. They are working with the agencies on the ground and the government of the Philippines to assess the scale of the need and advise on what the UK can do to help. The British Red Cross already had workers in the Philippines helping victims of the earthquake which struck the Bohol area last month. They have been redirected to help in the aftermath of the typhoon. Another team has flown out to the Philippines from the UK. The organisation has contributed £100,000 to the relief effort and is appealing for more donations from the public. It has sent a logistics deployment to Philippines capital Manila, which is being deployed to the badly hit area of Cebu, where the British Red Cross has a distribution hub. Already 280 cubic metres of relief materials have been sent to the area from Malaysia, including 10,000 tarpaulins, 20,000 jerry cans and 47,000 hygiene kits. More supplies are due in Cebu from a Red Cross warehouse in Dubai on Tuesday. Meanwhile, workers at the British Red Cross's warehouse in Bristol will spend Tuesday loading logistical supplies such as computers, printers, forklift trucks, vehicles, as well as water purification and sanitation kits, tents and heavy duty kit, which will be flown out from Stansted airport on Thursday. A shelter expert will also be on the flight. A spokeswoman said: "It's going to be a long operation. We're setting up for months and years." Oxfam has launched a £10m public appeal to raise money to help 500,000 people in the disaster zone. The money will be used for water tanks and latrines to ensure a safe water supply and toilets, as well as providing temporary shelter for people who have lost their homes. The charity has already sent its rapid assessment teams to the affected areas of Samar, Leyte and northern Cabu to provide emergency supplies of water, sanitation and shelter. An aid shipment of water and sanitation equipment from the UK is expected to be dispatched within the next 48 hours. Spokesman Graham Mackay said: "Our main concern is getting relief to the worst affected areas. Because communications are down the real extent of this horrific disaster is still not known." The charity says the most urgent needs are for food, water and shelter. Communities also need to have power and communications restored and roads need to be cleared so that aid can get through. Save the Children has provisions stockpiled in a warehouse in Dubai. It is expecting to fly 40 tonnes of medical equipment, materials to build shelters, health and sanitation equipment to the disaster area on Wednesday morning, along with logistics experts and technicians to help with building. It also has assessment teams in the Philippines gathering information on the situation there and on what work needs to be done. The charity will focus particularly on child protection, setting up child-friendly spaces, where children can play and attempting to deliver books so they can continue some form of learning since many schools have been destroyed. With many children separated from their families, it hopes to help them feel safer and less frightened on their own. It has launched an appeal for money and estimates the cost of its efforts will be $30m (£18.7m). Care International UK has a small team already on the ground in the coastal province of Leyte which has been badly affected. Two shelter experts flew out from the UK on Friday and are assessing what needs to be done. A spokeswoman said the charity hoped to help 30,000 families in the province - an estimated 150,000 people - by providing shelter, water and food, which it says are the most immediate needs. Its staff are sourcing supplies in the Philippines capital Manila including rice, cooking utensils and tarpaulins for shelter. It has also launched a public appeal for money and hopes to raise $5m (£3.1m) globally to fund its operations. </body>

      <title>Christie - the Republicans' best shot at the White House</title>
      <description>Mark Mardell on New Jersey's governor White House chances</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24894345</url>

      <body>This week's Time magazine front cover with Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, is titled "The elephant in the room". He told ABC: "If I'm bothered by jokes about my weight, it's time for me to curl up into the foetal position and go home, OK?" "So let's get the fat jokes out of the way first. Christie is a big figure, a heavy hitter and a weighty presence," his campaign manager and friend of 20 years Bill Palatucci tells me. "It certainly doesn't bother anyone in New Jersey, we all have our struggles. He's got a bit of a weight problem, but it doesn't hold him down whatsoever." What is important is the big guy's next trick, which requires all the poise of a tightrope walker, balancing on the taut wire stretching between popular appeal and conservative distaste. Make no mistake - he could be, puns aside, a huge player. He could be the Republicans' best stab at the White House in 2016, potentially transforming his party in the process. He has, as far as I can see, a unique appeal in American politics, reaching parts that Hillary Clinton can't. Rush Limbaugh, the hyper-conservative, Tea Party-adored doyen of right-wing talk show hosts, says it tells you all you need to know that Democrats love Christie, that he is a creation of the liberal media. He has a point, although not the one he thinks he is making. Christie's importance is precisely because a third of self-identified Democrats who voted in New Jersey vote for him. It is because liberals in the Washington media establishment can vaguely imagine holding their ideological noses and voting for him. Hurricane Sandy defined Chris Christie - he toured his smashed-up state, throwing his big arms around the newly homeless. He also gripped the hand of President Obama, praising him for helping the rescue operation with government money - this, just days before last year's election. It disgusted some conservatives. He looked like a man more concerned about helping people than remaining pure to a cause. He talks of getting the job done and working together at a time Washington can do neither, mainly because of the shenanigans of his own party. But a lot of Americans like this sort of talk - you might even remember the senator who said there was not a liberal America, or a conservative America but the United States of America. It can be the key to the White House. There are two main ways to win elections (they are not mutually exclusive). One, you can motivate and organise and drag out all the people who, in theory, like your party and should be voting for you. This is what Obama did in 2008 and 2012. Second, you can hoover up the swing voters, the people in the centre and some of those who often vote for the other party. It is a typical mistake of both politicians and journalists to talk in shorthand implying everyone is born with a party label around their necks. It is not true. Even in the extraordinarily partisan world of US politics there are plenty of people who change from one election to another or split the ticket, voting say one way for the Senate, the other for the president. Here's the thing - although the Democrat nomination is Hillary Clinton's for the taking, she can't necessarily pull off this trick. Many Republicans heartily dislike the Clintons, and her appeal to the centre is uncertain. New Jersey exit polls indicated voters preferred Hillary Clinton by 49% to Christie's 43%. That's not bad in a long-time Democrat state. But to get a shot at the general election, Christie has to win his own party's nomination first. That will be really hard - in 2012, the Republican candidates tried to outdo each other by appealing to the right, and as a result Mitt Romney found himself trapped inside an ideological bubble of his own design, unable to appeal to his natural constituency of business-minded moderates. Christie may be pugnacious on low taxation and the unions, but he has already evoked conservatives' ire. He will have trouble convincing them he's the real deal. On the Sunday shows, he tried a combination of "Let's work together" and "I'm just the governor of New Jersey", but I'd expect him now to trim to the right to an extent. I asked his old friend Bill Palatucci what he made of the Tea Party criticisms. He said: "There are lots of elements of the Tea Party. The governor has great, great support in New Jersey for cutting taxes and making government smaller. Our spending in New Jersey in 2014 is less than in 2008. "I think the Tea Party is about freedom and smaller government and the governor is about the same things." So he can appeal to conservatives? I ask. "Absolutely. The governor is very much a conservative, very much pro-life, against gay marriage, worked very hard to get Mitt Romney elected. "His accomplishments on fiscal issues when the state was on the brink of bankruptcy, turning that around - that's a record many conservatives like." But Christie has ducked and weaved along the centre line. He's long been anti-abortion, but hasn't made a big deal of it; he's opposed gay marriage but recently ordered New Jersey courts to drop an appeal against it; and he's banned conversion therapy for gay kids in New Jersey. So I ask - will he stand for president? Bill Palatucci laughs long and hard. "We'll wait and see," he says. "He's just got re-elected so it's important to get to the job of the second term, a good second term." That indeed may be critical - New Jersey's economy is not in a great way. But for the next three years, Christie will be on the tightrope - how he sways and if he falls will be vitally important for his party and the country. </body>

      <title>New mums 'paid' to breastfeed</title>
      <description>New mothers are to be offered up to £200 in shopping vouchers to encourage them to breastfeed their babies under a pilot scheme being launched.</description>

      <body>New mothers are to be offered up to £200 in shopping vouchers to encourage them to breastfeed their babies. The pilot scheme is being targeted at deprived areas of South Yorkshire and Derbyshire and funded through a collaboration between government and the medical research sector. A third area is expected soon with the plan to trial it on 130 women who have babies from now until March. If it proves successful, a nationwide pilot could be rolled out next year. The use of financial incentives is not new in the NHS. It has been tried before to encourage people to quit smoking as well as lose weight. But this is the first time it has been tried on such a scale for breastfeeding. Under the scheme mothers from specific parts of Sheffield and Chesterfield will be offered the vouchers, which they can then use in supermarkets and high street shops. The areas have been chosen because they have such low breastfeeding rates. On average just one in four mothers are breastfeeding by the six- to eight-week mark compared with a national average of 55%. To qualify for the full £200 of rewards, the women will have to breastfeed until six months. However, it will be frontloaded enabling those taking part to get £120 for breastfeeding for the first six weeks. Midwives and health visitors will be asked to verify whether the women are breastfeeding. The team behind the project said breastfeeding was a cause of health inequalities, pointing to research that showed it helped prevent health problems such as upset stomachs and chest infections as well as leading to better educational attainment. Dr Clare Relton, the Sheffield University expert leading the project, said she hoped the financial incentives would create a culture where breastfeeding was seen as the norm. "It is a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies, mothers and society," she added. But Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives, questioned the initiative. "The motive for breastfeeding cannot be rooted by offering financial reward. It has to be something that a mother wants to do in the interest of the health and well-being of her child." She said the answer lay in making sure there were enough staff available to provide comprehensive support to new mothers after birth. </body>

      <title>'Hidden workforce crisis' in nursing</title>
      <description>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, says the Royal College of Nursing.</description>

      <body>NHS trusts trying to recruit more nurses in the wake of the Mid Staffs scandal may struggle, a nursing union is warning. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) says there are nearly 20,000 unfilled posts in England. And it says more than a fifth of trusts are recruiting nurses from abroad. The government says staffing levels have improved - there are now over 1,350 more qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors than a year ago. The RCN sent requests under the Freedom of Information Act to all acute, mental health and community NHS trusts in England as part of its three-year-old Frontline First campaign against job cuts. Some 61 organisations replied - representing a response rate of 24%. The trusts who responded had an average vacancy rate of 6% - though in some trusts this was as high as 16%. The union believes this constitutes "a hidden workforce crisis". The RCN asked for the data because the government stopped collecting it in 2011. The last available figures showed a vacancy rate of 2.5%. More trusts - 140 - answered questions about overseas recruitment. These replies showed 22% were recruiting nurses from abroad, while a further 9% were considering the possibility. Earlier this year an inquiry highlighted the "appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people" at Stafford Hospital in Staffordshire. The Francis report found systemic failures that went right to the top of the NHS in England. On Tuesday the RCN's head of policy, Howard Catton, said: "In recent months we've seen the 'Francis effect' after the report into Stafford Hospital, with some trusts unfreezing posts that were vacant. "But when they've gone to the market to try to recruit staff, they've found it difficult. This is because there's been a cut in the number of nursing student places. "And overseas recruitment is more difficult, because there's a shortage of many thousands of nurses across the EU." Official figures show 5,870 nursing posts have been lost in England since 2010. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, said: "Unsafe staffing levels have been implicated in a number of high profile investigations into patient safety. "We call on employers in the NHS to put an end to boom-and-bust workforce planning and develop clear standards to ensure safe staffing levels are met, supported by robust inspection based on reliable data." Health Minister Norman Lamb said: "Nursing leaders have been clear that hospitals should publish staffing details and the evidence to show the numbers are right for the services they deliver. "Patient-safety experts agree that safe staff-patient ratios should be set locally. "We will be announcing more on our plans to guide staffing decisions in our full response to the Francis report later this autumn. "Overall, the number of clinical staff in the NHS has increased by nearly 4,100 and the number of admin staff has fallen by 22,800. "The chief inspector of hospitals will be able to take action if trusts are found to be compromising patient care by not having the right number of staff on wards." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "David Cameron is making matters worse. We should be bringing on the next generation of British nurses, but he's cutting trainee nurse posts whilst wasting money on overseas recruitment." The organisation NHS Employers said the figures needed to be seen in the context of the 347,000 qualified nurses working in the NHS every day. Every month the NHS recruits around 10,000 staff through natural turnover, it said. </body>

      <title>'Frustration' as measles cases grow</title>
      <description>A senior doctor speaks of his frustration with a second crop of measles cases in south Wales, just months after a large outbreak ended.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-24899459</url>

      <body>A senior doctor has spoken of his frustration with a second crop of measles cases in south Wales just months after a large outbreak ended. Dr Jorg Hoffman from Public Health Wales spoke as a report into the eight-month outbreak is due to be released. From last November to June there were over 1,200 suspected cases of measles reported in south, west and mid Wales, and one man died as a result. A new outbreak starting at a Neath school last month has led to 36 cases. Updated figures for the latest outbreak will be published later. Dr Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health Wales (PHW), said the new outbreak was a result of the virus being re-imported into the Swansea area from outside Wales. He told BBC News that cases were being reported on a daily basis. "It's very frustrating. Numerous times we wrote to every GP, to schools, and said 'we're still seeing measles, you must check your child's vaccination status' and get them vaccinated if uncertain or if they know they have not had it," he said. Vaccinations with the MMR triple jab dipped sharply in the Swansea area following a now discredited report in the late 1990s wrongly linking the vaccine to cases of autism. Dr Hoffmann said there had been 35,000 extra vaccinations in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg (ABM) University Health Board area during the last outbreak but added there were still children unprotected in the 10-18 age group who did not have their MMR jabs as toddlers. In the ABM area, 95% of teenagers had had at least one dose of MMR, while 90% had had both. Dr Hoffman stressed that of those who had only had one dose, 10% would remain vulnerable to measles. He said people who had had the first jab during the outbreak had sometimes not come back for the second. "I think it's human nature that once the threat is gone they move on," he added. As yet, scientists have not been able to establish where the first case of the current outbreak came from. Last year's outbreak was traced to a holiday camp in England. "The virus is endemic in England, Europe and other parts of the world and some people will bring it back from there," said Dr Hoffman. He explained that with 30,000 10-18-year-olds across Wales still unprotected, there was potential for the number of measles cases to rise, although he added he did not think it was as likely to grow to the extent of the previous outbreak. "We're trying very, very hard to contain this. We do not want a repeat." He said parents of those affected had been advised to stay away from children's centres and sporting events while their children were infectious. "The majority of people are very good at complying, but a proportion are not," he said. Dr Ian Millington, a Swansea GP for 40 years and secretary of the local medical committee representing doctors to the health board, said the new outbreak was "very worrying". He was concerned that many people were still resistant to the vaccination message. "I think some is complacency, some ignorance and some is 'it isn't in my face'," he said. "We're getting into a hard core of people who don't believe in vaccinations or are burying their heads in the sand." Dr Millington thought appealing directly to the teenagers who had missed out on vaccinations because of their parents' view could work. "This is another way forward in the hope that they will see they are exposed to a high risk of a nasty disease." </body>

      <body>A report into a GP who filmed intimate sexual examinations with a camera hidden in a watch has found a senior GP had concerns about his behaviour. Davinderjit Bains from Swindon pleaded guilty to 39 sexual offences in May. He was sentenced to 12 years in jail. The 46-year-old, who worked at Tinkers Lane Surgery in Royal Wootton Bassett, was struck off the medical register. A spokesman for NHS England said steps had been taken to reduce the risk of a similar incident happening again. The NHS report into the way the surgery was run, which was written in January when Bains was being investigated but which has only just been made public, found a senior GP had concerns about Bains' attitude to patients but was unsure what to do about it. It also found the surgery did not offer chaperones to people having intimate examinations. Such as policy has since been brought in. The report found the need for a better complaints procedure, a better whistle-blowing policy and more training for staff. A spokesman for NHS England said: "We have worked with the GPs and practice team from Tinkers Lane Surgery, reviewing processes and policies, and made changes to any areas that fell short of best practice, with particular regard to chaperone policies. "We have also worked promptly with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), who have been involved in reviewing the quality of services provided at the surgery, and who have made specific recommendations relating to three key areas of care. "We again extend our sincere apologies, on behalf of the NHS, to all those affected by the evil actions of this individual." Bains, from Nyland Road, Swindon, pleaded guilty in May to sexual offences against 32 victims aged between 14 and 51. </body>

      <description>Serco may face fines over its community health service in Suffolk after NHS commissioners found it was failing to meet key targets.</description>

      <body>Serco may face fines over its community health service in Suffolk after NHS commissioners found it was failing to meet key targets. The multinational private company took on the £140m contract to run community health services in Suffolk last autumn. It has been issued with a "performance notice" and a review into patient safety issues has been launched. The company says there has been a period of transition but insists it is delivering a high level of care. Serco is one of the companies bidding for NHS contracts, worth £6bn, currently out to tender in England. According to unpublished figures seen by the BBC, Serco's community intervention teams are failing to meet urgent four-hour response targets - for nurses and therapists to reach patients at home. It was also failing to meet non-emergency 72-hour targets. The report, by clinical commissioners in Suffolk, also reveals delays in producing care plans for palliative patients and carrying out health assessments for children in care. The commissioners have raised a contract query and issued Serco with a performance notice. A quality review is also under way into "potential patient safety issues", including training, staff capacity and workloads. The chief officer of the East and West Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Groups, Julian Herbert, says Serco has until the end of the year to meet the eight performance targets, or face fines in early 2014. "Some of Serco's speed of response is not as we'd like. And we've picked up areas about care leader availability and care plans being in place," he said. "There are areas where the staff levels aren't as we'd like them to be. Serco is looking to resolve those. It gives Serco a chance to put things right. "If they aren't put right, we then get to the point where we start financially penalising them, by taking money away from them if they don't deliver," he added. The commissioners say they are generally satisfied with the service and are working with Serco on a remedial action plan. The BBC has heard concerns from some nurses working for Serco that staffing shortages mean some community intervention teams in Suffolk don't have cover at night, resulting in some patients being admitted to hospital. Sharon Colclough, director of community services for Serco Health, says while there are some staff vacancies, the community teams are delivering a high level of care. "Some teams have some vacancies and we are giving them additional support at this moment, but every service is delivering the kind of care that we expect them to. We are recruiting two posts now and we're supporting staff as much as we can. "We're coming out of six months of transition and we're trying to embed the changes. I'm not saying that we have got it perfectly right but we are absolutely committed to getting it right," she said. Serco has invested £4m in the service, including new computer systems and a 24-hour care co-ordination centre in Ipswich which provides a central point for all patient referrals. Serco signed a deal to run Suffolk Community Health for three years for £140m. This was £10m less than the former NHS trust's best price. Serco has made a loss in the first year, and has told the BBC it doesn't expect to make a profit during the life of the contract. Serco is also bidding for the biggest contract in the history of the NHS. It is one of nine providers shortlisted for a five-year, £800m contract to provide older people's services in Cambridgeshire. The winner of that tender will be announced next summer. Across England, 160 NHS contracts worth a total of £6bn are currently out to tender.

      <title>Scotland approves new cancer drugs</title>
      <description>Scotland becomes the first part of the United Kingdom to approve two new cancer drugs for routine use on the NHS.</description>

      <body>Scotland has become the first part of the UK to approve two new cancer drugs for routine use in the NHS. Enzalutamide, a treatment that could extend the life of men with advanced prostate cancer, has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. The SMC has also approved axitinib, a drug that could help kidney cancer patients whose disease has spread. The decisions have been welcomed by doctors and cancer charities. Prostate cancer affects more than 2,500 people in Scotland each year, with the disease becoming more advanced in 10% to 20% of sufferers. Dr Rob Jones, senior lecturer and honorary consultant in medical oncology at the University of Glasgow, said the approval of enzalutamide was a "notable milestone" which "paves the way for more men to be given precious extra months at a stage of life when time and quality of life is so cherished". Rob Lester, chairman of the Edinburgh and Lothian Prostate Cancer Support Group, also welcomed the decision. He said: "In recent years the number of people diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland has increased and now many men and their families are affected year on year. "Today's news brings fresh hope for these individuals. We look forward to a time when more men with advanced prostate cancer are eligible for this treatment." Campaigners from the Prostate Cancer UK charity said they would now campaign for enzalutamide to be made routinely available on the NHS elsewhere in the UK. The SMC also accepted the use of axitinib for treating kidney cancer patients, for whom some other previous treatments have failed. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which approves drugs for use on the NHS in England, has already decided not to recommend axitinib for use, meaning patients south of the border have to try to use the Cancer Drugs Fund to get the treatment. On average there are more than 800 cases of kidney cancer a year in Scotland, with about 340 deaths a year from the disease. Dr Jones, also a consultant at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, said: "It gives eligible patients access to an effective second-line treatment option where they previously had none." "It is also a positive sign for improving cancer outcomes for patients in Scotland where traditionally outcomes fall behind other European countries." Dr David Montgomery, medical director of drugs company Pfizer Oncology UK, said: "This important decision will benefit advanced kidney cancer patients in Scotland. "Historically access to cancer medicines has been a challenge in Scotland, compared with other European countries where oncologists regularly have access to a number of second-line advanced kidney cancer treatments. "This decision is a step in the right direction for improving access to cancer medicines in Scotland and improving outcomes for patients." </body>

      <title>Ward staff 'panicked' over heart boy</title>
      <description>The father of a boy who died following heart surgery tells an inquest of panic and a lack of organisation among hospital staff.</description>

      <body>The father of a boy who died following heart surgery has told an inquest of panic and a lack of organisation among hospital staff. Luke Jenkins, 7, of Cardiff had successful heart surgery at Bristol Children's Hospital on 30 March 2012. Stephen Jenkins said after surgery, Luke had only had "sporadic observation checks" and when he suffered a cardiac arrest, "everyone seemed to panic". The inquest at Avon Coroner's Court is scheduled to last for two weeks. Luke, who was born with a congenital heart defect, was expected to make a full recovery after having the corrective surgery. In a written statement, Mr Jenkins said he thought Luke spend about three days on a high dependency unit following the operation but was transferred to Ward 32 the following day. He said that while his son was on that ward, he and his partner "had concerns that Luke was not receiving the appropriate level of care and therefore we requested that he return to the paediatric intensive care unit". "Our request was denied and Luke remained on Ward 32." He said the ward had "seemed short-staffed and one of the nurses told me she had been called in by an agency and she was from Cardiff too". He added that "throughout those first two days, there were sporadic observation checks". Mr Jenkins said that on 2 April, his son had "complained of pain in his abdomen". He said a subsequent X-ray had shown Luke's chest was filled with fluid, which had to be surgically drained. The next day, Mr Jenkins said Luke had "seemed withdrawn and very quiet" and he had "had to ask for pain relief for Luke because the nurses did not routinely check". "I began to notice Luke's vital signs changing with an increase in heart rate and his blood pressure beginning to decrease. "We told the nurse that we wanted Luke to go to intensive care and we were very agitated that nothing was being done." The court heard on 6 April, Luke began complaining of severe chest pains and before the cause could be investigated, he suffered a cardiac arrest. "We believe it took between six and eight minutes before any proper alarms were raised and we were left holding an oxygen mask over his face," Mr Jenkins said. "There did not seem to be any organisation and everyone seemed to panic. "Eventually, the resuscitation team arrived and one of the doctors seemed quite agitated and asked staff what had gone on. "We were then told that he was seriously unwell and may not survive." Luke was then moved to intensive care where, on 9 April, Mr Jenkins said that his partner, Faye Valentine, 28, took the decision to switch off their son's life support machine. He added that the couple had had him christened and cuddled him as he died. The inquest continues. </body>

      <body>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has questioned the independence of an inquiry commissioned by a hospital into its own cancer waiting times. Colchester General Hospital was found by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to have "inaccuracies" in its data. An independent inquiry will look at "who knew what, and what they did", the hospital has said. But the RCN said "the sceptics may be forgiven for doubting this is truly independent". The CQC's report, which is being looked at by Essex Police, found staff were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines. The inspector said patients' lives may have been put at risk. Last week, the RCN claimed its concerns about a "bullying culture" were dismissed as "fantasy" by the hospital in February 2012. Colchester Hospital said that an internal inquiry at that time "didn't go deep enough". The new investigation it has commissioned is being led by former deputy chief medical officer of England, Prof Pat Troop, and ex-NHS Suffolk chief executive Carole Taylor-Brown. Ms Brown left the primary care trust in 2010 and now runs her own coaching and development consultancy, which has worked with other NHS trusts in Essex. Health regulator Monitor has agreed the terms of the hospital-commissioned independent investigation, the hospital said. The report will be sent to hospital trust chairman Dr Sally Irvine, who will then consider what action needs to be taken. Dr Irvine said: "The investigation has been asked to get to the bottom of who knew what, when they knew it and what they did - or did not do - about it. "This will be a far-reaching and detailed investigation but because of the urgency of the situation, I have asked for it to be completed as soon as possible." The RCN regional director Karen Webb said: "It's quite right that the trust should hold a thorough and open internal investigation into the failings that have harmed both public confidence and staff morale. "The RCN, however, would question whether this investigation can legitimately be called "independent" when the inquiry and its joint leads have been commissioned by the board of directors at Colchester. "The board has some very serious questions to answer about its corporate and clinical governance and the sceptics may be forgiven for doubting that an investigation commissioned by the Board to look into the Board's conduct is truly independent." Essex Police is looking into whether the case warrants a criminal investigation. </body>

      <body>Two midwives put a four-day-old baby on its stomach in a stationery cupboard at a London hospital to allow its mother to sleep, a tribunal has heard. Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, and Christine Onade, 46, are accused of failing to provide appropriate clinical care at Queen's Hospital, Romford. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard that in April 2011, Ms Malata moved the child to the cupboard when it became unsettled. Both midwives deny the allegation. Ms Malata and Ms Onade, 46, also deny failing to record any feeds given to the baby. The alleged incident on 18 April 2011 came to light after Alex Curtis, a nursery nurse, found the baby alone in the cupboard at about 06:30 BST. Derek Zeitlin, who presented the case to the NMC, told the hearing that the child's mother had a condition which made it important for her to get a good night's sleep and the midwives were invited to take the baby away. Mr Zeitlin said the child, referred to as Baby A, became unsettled and Ms Malata placed it in a cot in the doorway of the cupboard, keeping the door open. He said: "There came a stage where Ms Malata was called away to another patient and was away for about 20 minutes. "The next thing that happened was a member of the nursing staff went to the cupboard and was shocked to find Baby A inside." Ms Curtis told the tribunal that she had gone "to the post-natal ward to get an envelope from the stationery cupboard and found a baby lying on its tummy on its own". She said she had checked "if it was breathing". "We always lie a baby on its back as there is a risk of cot death," she said. The hearing also heard from another midwife, Rita Skeats, who said she had "recommended that the baby be cared for at the nursery, but Ms Malata and Ms Onade said they were coping OK and would keep the baby there". The hearing continues. </body>

      <body>A camel has tested positive for the Sars-like virus that emerged in the Middle East last year and has killed 64 people worldwide. The animal had been owned by a person diagnosed with Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, the Saudi health ministry said. It remains unclear, however, if camels are responsible for passing the disease to humans. Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals. It is possible the virus is spread in droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe the virus is not very contagious - if it were, we would have seen more cases. Globally, since September 2012, there have been 153 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Mers coronavirus. The Saudi government statement said "preliminary" laboratory checks had proved positive. The health ministry said it was working with the ministry of agriculture and laboratories to "isolate the virus and compare its genetic structure with that of the patient's". If the virus carried by the camel and that of the patient "prove to be identical, this would be a first scientific discovery worldwide, and a door to identify the source of the virus", it added. The World Health Organization, which has been monitoring the global situation, says there is currently no reason to impose any travel restrictions because of the virus. </body>

      <title>Scan predicts heart attack risk</title>
      <description>A new way of scanning the heart can identify those who may be at high risk of a heart attack, early studies in patients suggest.</description>

      <body>A new way of scanning the heart can identify those who may be at high risk of a heart attack, early tests suggest. It can identify dangerous plaques in the arteries which nourish the heart. If a fatty plaque ruptures, it can lead to a clot, blocking the flow of blood. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh said an effective tool for predicting a heart attack would make a "massive difference" to patients. Experts said it was an exciting start. More than 100,000 people have a heart attack in the UK each year and disease of the arteries around the heart is the leading cause of death in the world. The researchers used a radioactive tracer which can seek out active and dangerous plaques. This was combined with high resolution images of the heart and blood vessels. The overall effect is a detailed picture of the heart with the danger zones clearly highlighted. The technology is already used to detect tumours in cancer patients. The first tests of the technique for danger spots in the heart were on 40 patients who had recently had a heart attack. The scan highlighted the plaque which caused the heart attack in 37 of the patients according to a study published in the Lancet medical journal. It is the first time a scan has been able to identify danger zones but further tests are needed to see if detecting dangerous plaques before, rather than after, a heart attack has the potential to save lives. "I suspect not all plaques detected will cause a heart attack, but it could be useful for identifying high risk patients who need aggressive therapy," cardiologist Dr Marc Dweck told the BBC. This could include drugs such as statins or aspirin, drastic lifestyle change or even inserting stents into the arteries to keep them open. The researchers will look at high risk patients, including those about to have surgery, to see if the scan can save lives. Dr Dweck said if this scan or similar ones proved successful it would make a "massive difference". He said: "Heart attacks are the biggest killer in the Western world and there is no prior warning, the first time people know about heart disease is when they have a heart attack. "If we can treat and stabilise the plaques then we might be able to prevent heart attacks and stop people dying." Prof Peter Weissberg, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being able to identify dangerous fatty plaques likely to cause a heart attack is something that conventional heart tests can't do. "This research suggests that PET-CT scanning may provide an answer - identifying 'ticking time bomb' patients at risk of a heart attack. "We now need to confirm these findings, and then understand how best to use new tests like this in the clinic to benefit heart patients." Prof Andrew Morris, the chief scientist for health in Scotland, said: "These are exciting data - being able to prospectively identify patients at the highest risk of a heart attack and provide treatment to prevent this would be a significant step forward." </body>

      <title>Walk-in closures 'may cut GP access'</title>
      <description>Closing walk-in centres may make it harder for people to see GPs - and risks sending more people to A&amp;E, warns healthcare regulator Monitor.</description>

      <body>Closing walk-in centres may make it harder for people to see GPs - and risks sending more people to AandE, warns healthcare regulator Monitor. It reviewed the walk-in centre service after the closure of 50 of the 230 in England in the last three years. Monitor found the centres are popular with the public, but critics fear they can mean duplication of services. The government said walk-in centres were "one part" of out-of-hours care. Family GPs, community services and pharmacists all have a part to play, says Health Minister Lord Howe. But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the decision to dismantle walk-in centres was an act of vandalism and that patients were paying the price. As part of its review, Monitor surveyed just under 1,900 patients at 20 walk-in centres. When patients were asked where they would have gone if the walk-in centre had not been available, 21% said they would have gone to AandE, while a third would go to their own or a different GP. The poll also found 22% had tried to contact a GP practice but found no appointment, or none at a convenient time. And 24% did not even try to contact a GP because they did not think they would get an appointment. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair announced plans to establish the first walk-in centres in 1999, to provide convenient access to basic primary care services without the need for an appointment. As their name suggests, patients can 'walk in' and get seen. Most are GP-led, though some are overseen by nurses. Private companies, such as Virgin and Care UK, currently run around a sixth of the centres. The Monitor review found that walk-in centres were more likely to be used by those aged 16-45, with women slightly more likely to attend. Those that have closed have done so due to concerns they are not helping AandE. Many contracts for walk-in centres are up for renewal in 2014 and the review found confusion about who should decide on their fate, and said decisions had possibly been put off because of the upheaval in the NHS. Some commissioners also felt they were "paying twice" for patients, once with the GP they are registered with and a second time for their treatment at the walk-in centre. But Monitor said there should be careful thought about possible closures. Catherine Davies, Monitor's executive director of co-operation and competition, said: "We've been told that one in five people would choose to go to an accident and emergency department if the walk-in centre wasn't there for them. "While it is for commissioners to decide whether to keep a walk-in centre open, we need to make sure that the needs of patients are fully considered before decisions are taken." The review suggests the payment system to be changed so GPs have more of an incentive to be flexible, providing online or phone consultations, improving receptionist skills, extending hours or offering walk-in appointments. It comes as the College of Emergency Medicine has warned that more than half of specialist registrar posts in AandE have been left vacant over the past three years, with many doctors moving to other specialities or going abroad. Downing Street said that David Cameron is getting personally involved in overseeing the NHS's response to expected pressures on hospitals in England this winter. </body>

      <body>A scheme to encourage nursery children to brush their teeth has saved more than £6m in dental costs, according to a new study. Childsmile involves staff at all Scottish nurseries offering free supervised toothbrushing every day. Glasgow researchers found that the scheme had reduced the cost of treating dental disease in five-year-olds by more than half between 2001 and 2010. The programme was launched in 2001 and costs about £1.8m a year. It emphasises the importance of toothbrushing and helps parents establish a healthy diet from the earliest stage. A number of nurseries and schools in targeted areas also provide fluoride varnish and toothbrushing in primary one and two. An evaluation, funded by the Scottish government and carried out by Glasgow University, found that fewer children needed dental extractions, fillings or general anaesthetics as a result of the programme. There was also said to be a drop in the number of children needing hospital treatment for dental problems, freeing up operating theatres. Public Health Minister Michael Matheson said: "This is an amazing achievement and shows just how much can be saved from a very simple health intervention. "This has seen less tooth decay in children which means less toothache, fewer sleepless nights and less time off school. "By this simple measure, NHS costs associated with the dental disease of five-year-old children have decreased dramatically. "More children can just be treated routinely in the dental chair because they need less invasive treatments, so fewer fillings and fewer extractions, and many more children with much better oral health than we have seen in many years." </body>

      <description>Women's lung muscles have to work harder to breathe than men's leading to a higher incidence of breathlessness after exercise, say scientists in Canada.</description>

      <body>Women's lung muscles have to work harder than men's, making breathlessness more common after exercise, say scientists in Canada. Their study in the journal Experimental Physiology examined the activity of the diaphragm - the muscle that drives lung function. It had to work harder in women to compensate for smaller lungs, the research showed. The research was conducted at McGill University. Even with a man and a woman of equal size, the woman's lungs are smaller and their airways narrower. Breathlessness can occur after tough physical exercise or be a symptom of some illnesses such as bronchitis. "In both health and diseases, women are more likely to show signs of breathlessness after physical activity than men," said lead researcher Dr Dennis Jensen. The study compared 25 men and 25 women between the ages of 20 and 40, exercising on a bicycle. How deep and how fast they breathed at different levels of exercise were recorded. They also recorded the "drive to breathe", the electrical signals sent to the diaphragm to control its movement. Dr Jensen told the BBC: "Women have biologically smaller lungs and they have to activate respiratory muscles more to move a given amount of air." He said it was an "important insight into why women with emphysema and heart failure have worse breathing symptoms than men". Further studies will investigate the impact of obesity on breathlessness. </body>

      <description>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests. A study found more than two-thirds of men and around half of women in their early 40s were overweight or obese. However, the men were much less likely to realise they were carrying excess weight, say researchers at the University of London. The findings come from a study following 10,000 UK men and women born during one week in 1970. Those born in 1970 were considerably more likely to be overweight or obese in their early 40s than those born 12 years earlier, the researchers found. Men were far more likely than women to carry excess weight - with 45% classed as overweight and a further 23% obese compared with 29% and 20% of women. However, men were also much less likely than women to recognise they were overweight and attempt to slim down. Dr Alice Sullivan, of the Institute of Education at the University of London, told BBC News: "It's become so normalised for men to be overweight and they don't realise it - they're much less likely than women to realise their weight is unhealthy. "The worrying thing is that if men are overweight they are much less likely to take on health messages." Dr Sullivan and colleague Dr Matt Brown say carrying excess weight is seen as more socially acceptable for men than women. Overweight men are thus less likely to see this as a health problem and do something about it. Alerting men to their body mass index (BMI) status and the associated health risks should be a priority, they say. Commenting on the study, Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. "Worryingly, this research highlights that men seem more inclined to ignore their expanding waistlines than women. "Whether you're a man or a woman, maintaining a healthy, balanced diet and keeping physically active can help you reduce your weight and your risk of cardiovascular disease. "For advice and support on how to do this speak to your GP or practice nurse." The research studied the BMI of almost 10,000 men and women in their early 40s being followed by the 1970 British Cohort Study, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). </body>

      <title>'24-hour' complaint process needed</title>

      <body>Patients, carers and relatives should be able to raise concerns over NHS care 24 hours a day, suggests Health Ombudsman Julie Mellor. In this week's Scrubbing Up - she explains how she hopes the Clwyd-Hart Review of hospital complaints will help tackle the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance by patients to complain and defensiveness of NHS organisations when addressing complaints and concerns. Too often we hear of patients not having the confidence to raise a concern on a hospital ward. They fear they won't be listened to or taken seriously. Even if they do complain, they can find NHS organisations defensive rather than open to feedback. One of the many people who we've spoken to about complaining said: "I feel like the little man against the system". We know this is an issue from the ward to the hospital board. The Ombudsman report 'NHS governance of complaints handling' found that only a fifth of NHS boards review learning from complaints and subsequently take action to improve services. People come to us once they've exhausted the local NHS complaints process. Our new approach from April this year means we have already accepted three times more complaints for investigation than we did last year and are sharing more learning from them with the NHS. We want hospitals to change their approach too and to welcome complaints and concerns raised by patients and carers at a local level as opportunities for improvement. We think it is critical that the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance to complain by patients coupled with defensiveness by NHS staff and organisations is tackled as a priority. We need to see a shift to a more open, collaborative and transparent culture within the NHS. This emphasis on local resolution can lead to opportunities to learn and improve services, providing a change in complaints handling from ward to board level. In order to deliver this change, there needs to be a focus on what patients need to help them raise a concern. The research and evidence we submitted to the Clwyd-Hart Review provides a powerful picture of what good complaint handling looks like. For patients and carers, advice on how to raise a concern should be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that every patient, carer and relative would have the opportunity to raise an issue in person, by email or over the phone. They would also receive support in doing so through local advocacy services. We have suggested the creation of one easily identifiable brand for this which could be used by all advocacy services in every local authority in England. For hospitals, boards should take the lead in bringing about a change in culture from defensiveness to one that welcomes and encourages feedback, where they use information from complaints to put things right. And commissioners and regulators need to hold NHS organisations to account with regard to listening to concerns and using information from them to improve services. Improving complaints handling will ensure that the same mistakes in patient care do not happen time and time again. It will also help to better the public's confidence in the NHS. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Almost 9,000 people die from conditions related to alcohol each year in the UK. A former government drugs advisor, Professor David Nutt, believes it is possible to have the sensation of alcohol - minus the risk to your health. But the power of the drinks industry means that it would be difficult to bring this product to market. Professor Nutt, says that not only has he identified compounds that can give the sensation of alcohol, but also one which can reverse those effects - meaning people could become instantly sober - and he is trying to find investors willing to develop the idea. He said: "I think this would be a serious revolution in health... just like the e-cigarette is going to revolutionise the smoking of tobacco. "I find it weird that we haven't been speaking about this before, as it's such a target for health improvement." First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday 11 November 2013. </body>

      <body>One in six people over 65 have hidden serious injuries or illnesses from their loved ones, according to a new survey. Care and support provider Centra found that those who lied about illnesses did so because they felt they would lose their independence or be seen as a burden. The findings were no surprise to pensioners at a Birmingham market - with one man revealing to reporter Nick Garnett that he had hidden heart attacks, prostrate checks, a stroke and double bypass surgery. Tom Gentry, health policy expert from Age UK told BBC Radio 5 live's Drive: "The language that's often used to describe older people... doesn't give people the confidence that they'll get a response from telling people." </body>

      <description>Cameron takes centre stage amid warnings of NHS A&amp;E crisis</description>

      <body>This morning the prime minister's official spokesman said something important. He was asked to comment on reports in the Financial Times that David Cameron was personally overseeing plans to prepare the NHS for a cold winter that could put pressure on accident and emergency departments. The spokesman said this: "Is the PM working very closely with the Secretary of State for Health on health matters, with a particular focus on AandE? Absolutely he is doing that." He was then asked if it was true that the prime minister had demanded weekly updates on how many people were being admitted to AandE. The spokesman replied: "Yeah, he does want to and he continues to be up-to-date with the very best and latest figures, including the AandE statistics." So at a time when Labour is warning gloomily of what it calls a "winter crisis" in AandE, when some doctors are saying that emergency care is already under pressure, when some weather forecasters are predicting a bitterly cold snap as the gulf stream heads south, the prime minister has chosen to get personally involved. As Sir Humphrey might have said, that is rather bold. For it means that Mr Cameron will be seen to be making himself personally responsible for whatever happens in the NHS this winter. If anything goes wrong, he will not be able to blame his health advisers, his health secretary, his health secretary's advisers or even the health department as a whole. The buck will now stop in Number 10. Government sources say it is all about the prime minister showing that he is taking the issue seriously, that he is focused on the operational details, that he cannot be accused of complacency. But the former Labour Health Secretary Aneurin Bevan once said that in a centralised NHS the sound of a bedpan falling in his local hospital would reverberate in the Palace of Westminster. And this winter, if AandE departments struggle to cope, it could be sound of patients complaining from trolleys that will reverberate in the corridors of Downing Street. </body>

      <description>Helping children with speech problems</description>

      <body>Imagine listening to a foreign language you are not familiar with all day. It would be tiring and confusing. You would miss important information and you'd have to work very hard to understand what people were saying. That's what it's like to have a specific language impairment in your own language, says Gina Conti-Ramsden, professor of child language and learning from the University of Manchester. "These children aren't mute. They can talk - but it's a hidden disability," she says. "They can't understand what is said all the time and they find it difficult to put words together, and to express themselves." Most children with SLIs have quite severe language problems and can spend at least 50% of their education in specialist language units, staffed by specialist teachers and speech therapists, rather than mainstream schools. The aim is to enable them to go back into mainstream primary or secondary school, and that they can achieve a level of language which allows them to function in society, get a job and lead a normal life as an adult. Prof Conti-Ramsden's current research project is concerned with finding out what happens to such children as adults. Ross Watson, 25, forms part of her study - the largest of its kind in the UK. He spent most of his primary education in a speech and language unit, returning to mainstream education in Year 6. He remembers it as a tough time in his life. "They didn't help much to begin with. There was a lot of mickey-taking from the other kids. And I got frustrated and upset because I couldn't do things. "I didn't understand why they made me do music lessons when it would have been better to do extra English instead." In the end, Ross got nine GCSEs, impressing himself and his teachers with a C in French and a D in English. But he is honest about how his language impairment has affected him. He has always found it hard to put sentences together, he finds himself getting edgy in new situations and uncomfortable when he has to communicate with people, particularly face to face. "Talking on the phone is easier in some ways because I can't see facial expressions, which makes it worse to communicate because I'm always wondering what they're thinking." He says he can't work out when people are being sarcastic, which has led to lots of awkward situations in the past - and he suffers from short-term memory loss. "I'm still forgetful. I forget to call people back a lot. I have to write it down to remember. And I still find reading hard. I have to use a highlighter pen. "And in a group situation I don't say things first. I don't like to say anything too early in case I've misunderstood something." However, Ross has come a long way since he was a "very quiet boy in the classroom" who had trouble finding his voice. He went on to do a course in mechanical engineering at college and now works as a quality inspector of machine parts. In between he spent six years on an apprenticeship at a major defence company. But not everyone is as lucky as him. Afasic, the charity which supports children and parents with speech, language and communication needs, says 6% of children starting school have some degree of speech or language difficulty. Around one in 500 are thought to have a serious long-term problem. Picking it up early is important, says Alison Huneke, helpline manager at Afasic. "There's more time to address it if it's picked up at this stage and then the child has less experience of failing and losing ground. "But some schools are good at recognising these problems and some aren't." In fairness, she says it isn't always easy to recognise a specific language impairment. While in some children it will be obvious, others may need a speech and language assessment first - and it is possible it could be misdiagnosed. As we grow up language is fundamental to virtually everything we do, says Prof Conti-Ramsden, and problems with it can be linked to issues which develop later in life, like anxiety and depression. The worst-case scenario is that children with specific language impairments become young offenders, since around half of this group of people are thought to have language problems. Although young people with SLIs look normal, they can suffer from loneliness, struggle to form close friendships and grow up dependent on their parents. Employment is also hard to secure. But as an adult it is also possible to focus on the things you enjoy and are good at, much more so than at school. There are lots of things that Ross still doesn't find easy, such as writing reports, talking on the phone, detecting sarcasm and speaking to his boss, but he believes he acquired an inner strength from his early years of intensive speech and language therapy. This, he says, makes him quietly confident that he has the skills to compete with the brightest and best in society. </body>

      <title>Baby steps to saving lives</title>
      <description>How a simple measurement saves lives</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24728460</url>

      <body>Each year, one in 10 babies around the world will be born prematurely and over a million of those will die. But could measuring the size of a baby's feet help save lives? In the final weeks of pregnancy, the idea of going into early labour might not seem like such a bad thing. But giving birth prematurely - officially classed as before 37 weeks gestation - can lead to long-term health effects. Depending on quite how early the baby is born, infants can either be completely unaffected or left with permanent disability and learning difficulties. The issue of prematurity is particularly pronounced in South Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 80% of the deaths caused by pre-term birth complications. In rural Tanzania, for example, about one in every 30 premature babies won't make it past four weeks. However, most of those lives could be saved with simple advice for mothers. And that advice, says an international group of researchers, could start with just a footprint. Most mothers in high-income countries will give birth surrounded by medical equipment or with the support of a highly-skilled midwife. This means that any problems, such as a low birth-weight or the mother's waters breaking early, can be dealt with immediately. In contrast, around 40% of women giving birth in low-income countries will do so without the help of a trained medical professional. And due to inaccurate dating of pregnancy, many of those women will have no way of telling if their baby is too early or too small. However, measuring the baby's footprint could be used as a simple proxy for birth weight. "There's this grey area when the baby is between around 2.4kg (5lbs 5oz) and 2.1kg (4lbs 10oz) when the baby is more vulnerable to infection and other issues," says Dr Joanna Schellenberg of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "But when a baby is born at home, there is no way of weighing them," she told the BBC. To help solve the problem, Schellenberg and her colleagues at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania have implemented a strategy called Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga - which means "protect the newborn baby". It includes using a picture of two footprints on a piece of laminated card and a local volunteer placing the baby's foot against the images. If the baby has feet smaller than the smallest foot, around 67mm, then the mother is advised to take the baby to hospital immediately. If it measures in between the big and the small image, then the mother is told about the extra care she needs to provide to increase the baby's chances of survival. Although the card is fairly accurate for five days after birth, it should be used it to identify small babies in their first two days of life, which is when they're most at risk of dying without specialist care. Mariam Ulaya is one of the volunteers at Namayakata shuleni village and visits the women before and after the birth. "If I've measured the child's footprint and seen that the child is smaller than usual, then I instruct them to carry the child skin-to-skin so that the child can share and feel the mother's warmth," says Ulaya. "I also carry a small doll with me called Opendo. I use the doll to illustrate the proper way to breastfeed the child." Such advice may seem simple but can really be the difference between life and death. A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) says that of the 15 million premature births globally each year, more than 80% will occur between 32 and 37 weeks' gestation. Most of these babies will survive if given extra warmth through skin-to-skin contact and very regular breastfeeding to help fight off infection. In fact, the report states that an estimated 75% of deaths in preterm infants can be prevented in this way - without the cost and emotional upset of intensive care. Salima Ahmad is 25 and has three children who live with her in Namahyakata dinduma village, Tanzania. Her youngest son, Alhaji, was born prematurely. "I was a little bit shocked because many premature babies end up dying but I was also happy because I had a live baby," says Salima. Although Alhaji was born at the local hospital, Salima was given advice and support by volunteers from Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga about how to care for him once she got home. "Carrying skin-to-skin was good but difficult in the beginning. But when the volunteer was visiting me and encouraging me, I could see myself managing it slowly. It is good, it has helped my child to survive," she says. Salima also feels that understanding more about premature birth helps mothers like herself to deal with it properly. "It helps a lot for the mother not to be surprised when having a premature birth. It is useful to know in advance as you get good knowledge on how to handle the premature. Myself, I do thank the volunteer who talked about it when I was pregnant and she even taught me how to carry skin to skin." The project is still underway and it will take another six months before it's clear whether measuring feet has the ability to save thousands of lives. However, it is already having a positive effect on the way mothers in the area are preparing for childbirth. "When I had my first child, she was small and was not breastfeeding well and I did not know where to get help," says Rukia Twarib, who is currently pregnant with her second child. "Now I have information, if the situation ever happens again, I know can go to the health centre to get help." Advice from volunteers like Miriam also appears to be contributing to the increase in women now choosing to deliver at a health centre rather than at home. Dr Isa Lipupu works at the nearby Nangururwe health centre. "In the last two years, we had about 20 deliveries at the health centre. But this time we have already delivered more than 40 babies. This is about 60-80% of all the mothers that were pregnant," he says. If the strategy proves successful, then there are already plans to roll out the footprint scheme to the rest of Tanzania, giving more health volunteers the ability to quickly spot at-risk babies. "Right now many people are aware of the work I do. All the families have been very welcoming and have accepted me and this programme," says Mariam Ulaya. "I have seen a lot of changes in the area. I can see that there are more mothers visiting the clinic and giving birth there - much more than they used to do - and so I am grateful for that." </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly identified ligament may hold the key to common injuries</description>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <description>Key questions raised by patient record tampering at Colchester General</description>

      <body>Inspectors have found evidence of cancer records at an Essex hospital being tampered with, potentially putting patients at risk. A detailed report listing what was happening has been produced by the Care Quality Commission after inspectors went in at the end of August and start of September. The case has now been passed on to the police to investigate and the trust - Colchester General - faces being put into special measures and further investigations by the authorities in the NHS. In the weeks and months that come there are many questions that need to be answered. Inspectors looked at just over 60 cases and found the care of 22 may have been compromised. All but two of these case were chosen at random. That suggests this practice could have been pretty widespread. NHS England has set up a specialist team to look at the care given to patients since 2010. The hospital sees about 6,000 cancer patients a year, although the tampering with records seems so far to be centred around the specialities that deal with cancers such as kidney, bladder, prostate and colon. Senior management of the trust was alerted to what was happening early last year. An internal review was carried out by two members of the trust's executive team, but it did not result in the practice being stopped. The trust now concedes the investigation was not carried out properly- and has apologised for that. Colchester has yet to release details of that investigation or even said much about how it was carried out. But senior bosses - including the current chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts who has been in post since September 2010 - will have to explain themselves soon. The trust said a review of what went wrong with this investigation will be carried out. Colchester was one of 14 hospital trusts inspected as part of the Keogh Review into centres with high mortality rates. Eleven were subsequently put into special measures, but Colchester was one of three that escaped the sanction. A whistleblower alerted the Keogh team towards the end of the programme abut the tampering with records and this was passed on to the CQC for follow up. Those involved in the Keogh process say there was not sufficient concerns about the leadership of the trust to warrant it being placed in special measures. But the fact such a shocking practice was not dealt with by the Keogh inspection process - which has, after all, formed the basis of the new CQC hospital inspection regime that got under way in September - is a cause for concern. One of the elements of the Stafford Hospital scandal was that there was evidence out there about the poor care that patients were receiving. Patient surveys and complaints all pointed to the fact that something was not right. The problem was that the people with the power to act either ignored the warning signs or missed them. Did the same happen here? It is too early to tell. But what we do know is that the trust had a much higher than expected number of complaints being made against it, according to the CQC. Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing also say they were trying to raise the alarm, but managers dismissed their concerns. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, says he has never before heard of anything like this happening anywhere else. But what this case proves is that problems of this nature are very difficult to spot. The CQC inspection team only found evidence of tampering after being told exactly where to look. That raises the prospect that it could be going on undetected elsewhere. However, as the new hospital inspection regime is rolled out - by the end of 2015 all hospital trusts will have been visited - inspectors are bound to be keeping an eye out for this sort of practice. </body>

      <body>The NHS knows it's coming, but the big question is whether it can do anything about it. Winter is traditionally the toughest time for the health service, particularly for AandE departments. Waiting times are often at their highest as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors with injury and illness. And it looks like this year will be the worst one for a long time. Last winter the NHS in England missed it's waiting time target from January to March as waits hit their longest for nearly a decade. Any hopes that this was a one-off blip have already been dismissed. The summer was the worst on record for many years. The major AandEs - known as type one - missed their four-hour waiting time target during the spring and summer. It prompted Labour to accused the government of overseeing the "first summer AandE crisis in living memory". Doctors are worried too. Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that staff were preparing for "what may be our worst winter yet". "We have got severe weather problems on the way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections - things like winter vomiting bugs - we know that this puts our departments under huge pressure." But NHS England's medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh says plans are in place to help relieve the pressure. The government made an extra £250m available in the summer to help this winter. Another £250m will follow in a year's time. This is going direct to the worst-hit AandEs as well as surrounding community services, such as getting pharmacies to open longer. The idea is to give patients with less serious conditions more options other than AandE. Sir Bruce believes the early planning this year will help "decongest" some of the pressure points. But it is clear the problems are much more deep-routed than that. A quarter of visits to AandE lead to an emergency admission, suggesting many patients do in fact have a serious health issue that needs treating and, therefore, cannot be diverted to other parts of the health service. These have been rising since the late 1990s. A National Audit Office report published last week showed rates had risen by 47% in the past 15 years. Of these, a fifth are estimated to be avoidable - that is to say if the patient received better care in the first place the emergency would not have materialised. The frail elderly are the major cause of these admissions, presenting with problems such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. This shows if better support was available in the community there could be a significant reduction in demands on AandE. However, tackling this requires long-term solutions - something NHS England has already recognised as it has set up a review of the whole system. The plans for the future are to be unveiled later this month, but it will be several years before they have an impact. For the time being, those on the front-line in the NHS are bracing themselves for the a long, hard slog in the coming months. </body>

      <title>Face, get back to work!</title>
      <description>My year with a lopsided grin and an eyelid on strike</description>

      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>Gove urges child protection reform</title>
      <description>A systematic and radical reform of the child protection system in England is needed, says Michael Gove.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove is calling for "systematic" and "radical" reform of England's child protection system so it can meet the challenge it faces. The Education Secretary, who was himself adopted, says his life was "transformed" by the skill of social workers, and his adoptive parents. Many social workers were indoctrinated, however, to see the people they help as victims of social injustice, he says. This was pernicious and led to excuses being made for poor behaviour, he adds. Speaking at an NSPCC event, Mr Gove, who has responsibility for children's services as well as education, will say: "I believe that we have not been either systematic, radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country. "But that is changing. And it is my aim to ensure that change is equal to the challenge we all face." He said social workers needed to be skilful in developing relationships with adults and thinking about the needs of their children at the same time. He will go on to argue that great practice is being "undermined by dogma" and that he intends to "strip this out" of social work by reforming its structures and improving standards. "Social work training involves idealistic students being told that the individuals with whom they will work have been disempowered by society," he is expected to say. "They will be encouraged to see these individuals as victims of social injustice whose fate is overwhelmingly decreed by the economic forces and inherent inequalities which scar our society," he will add. "This analysis is, sadly as widespread as it is pernicious. It robs individuals of the power of agency and breaks the link between an individual's actions and the consequences. It risks explaining away substance abuse, domestic violence and personal irresponsibility, rather than doing away with them." It could lead social workers "to see their job as securing the family's access to services provided", rather than "helping them to change their own approach to life". "Instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour, and improve their own lives, some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices," he will say. The speech comes as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill in the Lords is set to make it more straightforward for the secretary of state to intervene in failing local authorities. Some were already doing so, such as Kensington and Chelsea and Richmond, the Department for Education said, and this was bringing benefits. There is one local authority children's services, Doncaster, which has been completely taken out of council control. A private consultancy firm has been chosen to run the troubled department wholesale. But the DfE is said to be eyeing a number of other children's services departments which are thought to not be performing as well as they should. </body>

      <body>The influence that a privately educated, middle-class elite have on public life is "shocking", former prime minister Sir John Major has said. Sir John said the "upper echelons of power" were dominated by those from a similar background. In a speech to Tory activists reported in the Daily Telegraph he blamed "the collapse in social mobility" on the failures of the last Labour government. More than half the current cabinet were educated at private schools. David Cameron was educated at Eton, as was the Mayor of London Boris Johnson and the Archbishop of Canterbury The Right Reverend Justin Welby. Nick Clegg attended Westminster while George Osborne and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman went to St Paul's. In contrast, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - grew up in Brixton and left his grammar school with three O-levels. In a speech to the South Norfolk Conservative Association's annual dinner, he bemoaned what he said was the lack of people from working and lower middle class backgrounds in positions of influence in British institutions. "In every single sphere of British influence, the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class," he said. "To me, from my background, I find that truly shocking." Sir John said the Labour government, in power between 1997 and 2010, had left a legacy of a "Victorian divide between stagnation and aspiration" which current leader Ed Miliband was in no position to address. Too many children, he added, were "locked into the circumstances in which they were born" as a result of a lack of educational opportunities. He added: "I remember enough of my past to be outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost... we need them to fly as high as their luck, their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them. "And it is not going to happen magically." Sir John also called for more help for savers, who have seen their incomes eroded by "cripplingly unfair" low interest rates since 2008. He urged the Bank of England to raise interest rates to "normal levels", which he suggested were between 3% and 5%, as soon as was economically feasible. He also advised his party against "personal attacks" on UKIP, suggesting many of their supporters were natural Conservatives who were "patriotic Britons" who felt "bewildered" by the pace of social change. The speech is his second intervention in contemporary politics in a matter of weeks, after his call earlier this month for a windfall tax on energy profits in the event of a harsh winter and a warning about hidden "lace curtain poverty". The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said he did not believe the comments were an attack on the current Conservative leadership but a plea for those from modest backgrounds to have more say in public life. The former prime minister, Nick Robinson added, was speaking up for what he regarded as his party's natural constituency, the hard-working but aspiring majority who were not well-off. Downing Street rejected any suggestions of a rift with Sir John, saying Mr Cameron spoke to his predecessor "pretty regularly". And the prime minister said initiatives such as the help-to-buy scheme - which is designed to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5% on homes worth up to £600,000 - was all about promoting social mobility. Figures show 2,384 people, the majority first-time buyers, have applied for loans under the scheme in its first month. "Without this help to buy, we were beginning to see a country where only people who had wealthy mums and dads, who could give them the money for the deposit were able to buy a flat or a house," Mr Cameron said. For Labour, Kevin Brennan, shadow schools minister, said Sir John was "telling people what they already knew", saying the government was "out of touch" with "the next generation being locked out of opportunity". The UK Independence Party said the Conservatives were as much to blame as Labour for the social and educational imbalance at the top of British institutions. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: "The abolition of selective education in Britain has been a hammer blow to the prospects of working class kids. Until we see a grammar school back in every town and city across the UK, Britain's shocking lack of social mobility will go on." </body>

      <title>Boost skills education say employers</title>
      <description>Almost two thirds of UK employers feel the UK government does not do enough to support vocational education.</description>

      <body>Almost two thirds (60%) of UK employers feel the UK government does not do enough to support skills education. Nearly three quarters (72%) said they viewed vocational qualifications as essential for preparing young people for work. Over 1,000 employers were quizzed for qualification provider City and Guilds and skills charity Edge Foundation. The government said its reforms to apprenticeships were putting "employers in the driving seat". Researchers questioned recruitment managers at a range of small, medium and large businesses in a variety of sectors across the UK. Over half (53%) said they valued vocational qualifications in prospective employees above academic attainment. Some 78% agreed that young people who preferred practical learning need a better alternative route to A-levels. An overwhelming 83% said young people needed better advice on the career options open to them. Some 84% also agreed that pupils needed more robust work experience while they were still at school. The survey findings echo widespread concerns that vocational education can too often be of low quality, too short and fail to lead to jobs or further study. More than two years ago a review of vocational qualifications by Prof Alison Wolf recommended an wholesale overhaul. And last year a review of apprenticeships for the government by entrepreneur Doug Richard recommended that they should last for at least a year and genuinely prepare trainees in a new role. Earlier this year the Confederation of British Industry criticised the education system for continuing to focus teenagers on the "default" university route which, it said, would fail to close the UK's "chronic skills gaps". Research for qualification provider City and Guilds this month found that half of businesses thought that the current education failed to meet their needs, while a third had considered recruiting skilled workers from abroad. The government has embarked on a range of changes to vocational education and training in schools, colleges and work-places. A spokeswoman for the Department of Business Innovation and Skills said: "Apprenticeships are a proven vocational route to a successful career. "We have set out a clear and coherent set of reforms to apprenticeships. "We will continue to increase quality, simplify the system and put employers in the driving seat. "More than 60 employers from eight different sectors have already signed up to develop new standards as part of the first Apprenticeship Trailblazers. "We will work with more businesses and sectors over the coming months to develop concise employer-led standards for apprenticeships." The spokeswoman added that the government's new traineeships would help 16- to 24-year-olds improve their English and maths and to gain work skills and experience. Jan Hodges, of the Edge Foundation, said it was refreshing to hear how highly employers of all sizes rated vocational education. "We have skills gaps emerging in many sectors within the UK and it is crucial that young people are given the right training and encouragement to be able to fill these gaps." Chris Jones, chief executive of City and Guilds, said "In recent years society has placed too much emphasis on academia. "Employers are crying out for young people who have the right skills to add value to their business. "Vocational qualifications can provide these skills - but how many people know about them? "Careers advice provision in schools is limited, uninspiring and often purely focused on university." </body>

      <title>Children in care risk exploitation</title>
      <description>Children who are moved from area to area while in care risk sexual exploitation and poor support, a charity warns.</description>

      <body>Children who are moved from area to area while in care risk sexual exploitation as well as miss out on adequate education, health care and support, a charity has warned. Tros Gynnal Plant said some children get moved to new local authority areas. But it said councils often did not follow procedures to inform the child's new local authority of the move. The body which represents social services managers denied children got lost within the system. More than a quarter of the 5,900 children in care in Wales live outside the county that is responsible for them, sometimes because it is safer but often because of a shortage of foster care placements. When youngsters are moved out of their county, the council moving them should inform the new local authority and the two should work together to meet the child's needs. But in 2012-13 there were at least 60 cases where local authorities failed to share the details of children moving into their area. A BBC Wales investigation found councils often flouted Welsh government guidance on children in care. Only three kept the information and another 19 authorities did not record the information. Some councils said it would only know a child was moving to its area if it was told by the placing authority. Jackie Murphy, executive director of Tros Gynnal Plant, said in reality the numbers ignoring the guidance could be higher. "There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they're more at risk and very vulnerable," she said. "A lot of the time they're placed in private residential homes or schools. Again, we know that often these establishments are targeted by paedophiles. "Young people and peer groups just want to be accepted and be with young people so I think they can be very vulnerable." A disproportionate number of children in care were targeted by paedophile gangs in cases in Rochdale, Derby and Oxford, according to a UK government report. One of the five victims of the grooming network in Rochdale had been placed in a residential care home in the town by another local authority. The Gwent Missing Children Project is addressing the issue in a trial involving police and social and healthcare workers. Service manager Kerry Wade said: "It's helped hugely with child sexual exploitation and trafficking in Gwent. It's about everyone knowing what they need to know about that child. "We don't need to know everything about that child and it wouldn't be nice. "I wouldn't want everyone knowing my history, it's not nice for everyone to know. We need what we need to protect the child effectively." A UK government report last year said cross-boundary placements put a huge distance between the child and the social worker responsible for them, meaning they spend less time with the youngster. Ms Murphy said independent, professional advocacy could help. "Children and young people tell us time and time again that it helps them make sense of the system, that it's helped have a voice in the systems - that it helps them understand what's happening to them," she said. "Certainly it makes them feel in more control of their lives and it makes them feel listened to and not invisible." The Association of Directors for Social Services Cymru said a "minority" of children were placed outside their local authority. "It is an important decision in a child's life and, because children living away from their home area can be more vulnerable, there are strong safeguards to ensure that any risks are identified and tackled," said a spokesperson. "Regulations require the placing local authority to notify the receiving or host local authority that the placement is planned or has been made." But the association admitted there was "inconsistency in practice" adding: "The statutory responsibility for each child or young person still rests with the home (placing) local authority, regardless of where the placement is made. "These responsibilities include ensuring that all education, health and social care needs are appropriately met in line with the child's care plan and that there are regular visits to the child within the placement and to the carers. "It is not correct to state that children placed in other local authorities are 'lost' within the system or neglected." </body>

      <title>Living wage call for universities</title>
      <description>Hundreds of staff at Scottish colleges and universities are not being paid a living wage, according to research by unions.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of staff at Scottish colleges and universities are not being paid a living wage, according to unions. NUS Scotland and Unison said several institutions have staff earning what they described as "poverty pay". They want all staff paid at least £7.65 an hour. Universities said they were committed to offering their employees an attractive employment package and wage. The two unions made a series of Freedom of Information (FoI) requests. The living wage, promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, is an informal benchmark based on the amount an individual needs to earn to cover the basic costs of living. It is distinct from the legally-binding minimum wage. Across the UK, the TUC estimates the Treasury would save £3.3bn if all workers were paid a living wage. However, many employers argue they could not afford to pay all staff at that level. The unions said a minimum of 483 people employed directly by universities and 226 people employed by colleges in Scotland are paid less than the living wage. At the time of the unions' FoI requests the living wage was £7.45 an hour - it has since increased by 20p to £7.65 - while the legally-binding minimum wage increased last month to £6.31 an hour. However, some institutions were not paying far below the living wage. The University of the West of Scotland, for example, had 178 staff on less than the living wage - but nobody was earning below £7.39 an hour. Just three institutions had workers earning less than £7 an hour and only Abertay University appeared to have any staff earning the minimum wage. More than 400 companies and organisations across the UK are now officially accredited Living Wage Employers, and the Scottish government recently announced their support for the Living Wage accreditation scheme in Scotland. NUS Scotland and Unison Scotland welcomed that decision and are now calling on every university and college in Scotland to become accredited Living Wage employers. Sinead Wylie, NUS Scotland vice president, said: "It's important to recognise the college and universities throughout Scotland that pay their employees a living wage. "However, as we saw through recent strike action, far too many staff at Scotland's universities and colleges do not receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. "We need to ensure that we eliminate poverty pay rates at our colleges and universities. Higher wages are fed back into our economy and represent a significant saving to taxpayers, who otherwise subsidise low-paying employers through in-work benefits and tax credits." Dave Watson, Unison Scotland organiser, said: "Universities and colleges should be beacons of excellence, not the home of poverty pay. "Almost all the public sector in Scotland has recognised the value of the Scottish Living Wage - colleges and universities have an important role in promoting best practice into the wider community." Pay and conditions at universities are set across the UK by the Universities and Colleges Employers Association. Pay varies across Scotland's colleges, although there are moves towards returning to a national pay structure. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK said: "Universities are committed to offering their employees an attractive employment package and wage. "Universities have few problems recruiting and retaining staff at the lower levels of the pay spine. This is in large part due to the excellent benefits package offered, particularly when compared with other local employers. "The Living Wage is an important benchmark but does not recognise the full breadth of employment benefits enjoyed by staff in the higher education sector. Benefits include a generous pension scheme, excellent sickness and maternity pay and above average holiday entitlement." Two weeks ago thousands of university staff across the UK took a day's strike action in a row over pay. It centres around the trade unions' refusal to accept a 1% pay offer, which they say contributes to a real-terms pay cut of 13% since 2008. The University and College Union (UCU) said the report was a timely reminder of the discrepancies between the pay of those at the top and the rest of staff in universities. UCU's Scotland Official, Mary Senior, said: "Staff in our universities have suffered real-terms pay cuts year after year, while those at the top have continued to enjoy rises. "This report exposes the unfairness of pay rises for university principals when some staff are not even paid the living wage. "We hope the employers' representatives will take note of this report and understand the anger staff feel at the pay injustices in higher education." </body>

      <title>Academies rapped over standards</title>
      <description>The Department for Education warns 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing.</description>

      <body>A minister has warned 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing. The formal warning letters, issued since the start of this term, call for the schools to improve or face intervention. Five of the warnings were for schools in one academy chain, AET, which was prevented from further expansion earlier this year. All the schools warned may be put under new management unless they improve. Academies are state-funded but privately run schools. And the 912 sponsored academies, as they are known, are schools that have previously been struggling and have been handed over to education trusts to run with a view to improving them in a short space of time They are different from the 2,532 converter academies which tend to be higher achieving schools who have chosen to convert to academy status. Pre-warning letters, as they are called, are part of the process by which action is taken on sponsored academies which are not improving as well as they should. The standards of education they are providing are considered to be unacceptably low. The letters, all from junior education minister Lord Nash and his predecessor Lord Hill, appeared on a government website alongside 17 other older pre-warning and warning letters requiring academies to improve. This other batch related to the academic years 2011-12 and 2012-13 and have already been published, the Department for Education said. A DfE spokesman said: "The majority of sponsored academies are thriving under great leadership. Their GCSE results are improving far faster than in other state-funded secondary schools. "This is despite sponsored academies taking over from schools that were consistently underperforming, which can take time to reverse. "But results in a minority of sponsored academies remain stubbornly low. We will not tolerate long-term underperformance in any school - including in an academy. "That is why this government issues pre-warning letters and warning notices. The evidence shows that academies respond well to these warnings, achieving on average much better GCSE results afterwards. "However, as with maintained schools, if these academies still do not make the progress we expect, we will take further action. This may result in a change to the sponsorship arrangements." The Academies Enterprise Trust said it was acting to ensure a rapid and sustained improvement in the schools. A spokesman said: "The AET academies listed by the department have a history of underperformance and have been with AET only for a short time. Many of these schools have a significantly higher proportion of special educational needs and Pupil Premium pupils than the national average. Many of our pupils start life in our schools with attainment levels well below the national average for their age. "Our response to these challenges is to set ambitious targets for the progress that we expect pupils to make. Our culture of high aspirations is reflected in significant improvements in test and examination results across the board in the 21 primary and 24 secondary academies open for the full 2012-13 academic year." The news comes after the Education Select Committee called for academy chains to face inspections from Ofsted. </body>

      <title>More top graduates train as teachers</title>
      <description>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, official data suggests.</description>

      <body>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, according to the latest official figures. Two-thirds of postgraduate trainees in 2011-12 had a first or a 2:1, data from the Department for Education suggests. This was a rise of three percentage points on 2010-11. Teaching unions welcomed the figures but said the overall picture on teacher recruitment was patchy, with evidence of shortages in some areas. However Charlie Taylor, chief executive of the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said the figures were extremely good news. "Children deserve excellent teachers and today's statistics show the profession is attracting more of the country's top-tier graduates," said Mr Taylor. Some 12% of postgraduate trainees, more than 3,000, had a first class degree, up two percentage points on the year before. And the proportion of those with a 2:1 was 55% or almost 15,000 - up one percentage point. There was a two percentage point fall in the proportion of those with a 2:2 - to 27.4% or 7,450 trainees - and a very slight drop in those with third class degrees, the government says. Overall, 32,900 trainee teachers completed their courses in 2011-12. Of these 27,144 were postgraduates. The figures also showed a rise in the number of newly qualified teachers getting jobs within six months of qualifying. Of those whose employment status was known, some 91% had secured a job by January 2012 - a rise of at least 5% on 2010-11. "Schools recognise this increase in quality and more trainee teachers are finding jobs quickly," said Mr Taylor. The figures combine data on the numbers of teachers trained by universities, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, as well as figures for non-university trainees collected directly from training providers by the National College for Training and Leadership. These figures pre-date the government's School Direct programme which began the following year. School Direct is designed to boost the numbers of teachers trained directly by schools with support from universities. Some experts have raised concerns that the picture from more recent years may be of emerging shortages of teachers in some areas. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College leaders described the increases in the number of trainees with good degrees as "very good news". "However, there are still issues with certain subjects and in certain areas of the country. "Many schools report that they are struggling to recruit high quality teachers in core subjects, especially maths, English and science. "With the recent changes to initial teacher training, the big picture about where the gaps are has been lost." "It must be a priority for the government to reinstate a national strategy for ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of high quality teaching graduates coming through in every subject." Chris Keates of the NASUWT teaching union said the increase in the proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees began "long before this government took office". "Today's figures simply confirm the continuation of this long-term trend and reflect continuing increases in the proportion of 2:1 and first degrees awarded by higher education institutions." Ms Keates added preliminary figures for the following year suggested a fall in the number of applicants for teacher training places of "almost 15%" in 2012. "Concerns expressed by teachers, school leaders and training providers that the teacher training system is heading towards crisis continue to be ignored by ministers. "The adverse implications of the DfE's policies on pay, conditions and professional status are undermining the attractiveness of teaching and placing the sufficient supply of high quality graduate teachers at serious risk." </body>

      <title>11-plus coaching culture 'must end'</title>
      <description>An educational charity says the culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must end so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools.</description>

      <body>The culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must be ended so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools, an educational charity says. The Sutton Trust says grammar school entrance tests should also be changed regularly so they are tutor-proof. It urges grammar schools to offer test preparation classes to all candidates, so there is a "more level playing field" between rich and poor pupils. The government gives extra money to schools with disadvantaged pupils. The report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for Disadvantaged Pupils in England, says pupils from very low income families are outnumbered by four to one in grammar schools by children from fee-paying prep schools. It found only 2.7% of grammar school entrants were from families who qualified for free school meals, while 12.7% came from outside England's state sector - mainly independent schools. Overall in England about 20% of pupils are on free school meals. It is well known that many children from affluent homes are coached for entrance tests, with private tutors offering expensive coaching services particularly in areas where grammar schools are high achieving but few in number. The report also suggested that many parents were using the private preparatory school route to get their children through grammar school doors. Those on lower incomes are less likely to be able to afford to pay for tutoring or private education. Grammars that stand alone, rather than in a wholly selective authority such as Buckinghamshire or Kent, draw pupils from a wide geographical area. This is also true of London grammars which have wide catchment areas, with sometimes 10 or 11 candidates for every place. The competition for places is very intense and not just based on passing the 11-plus but getting the highest marks. The report called for these high achieving schools to increase outreach work "significantly". This could mean such schools encouraging low and middle income households to apply and doing more to dispel the the view that some parents may have of them as "elitist", it said. It even suggests giving priority to poor, bright pupils who meet certain entrance requirements and are eligible for the pupil premium because their families have been in receipt of certain benefits in the previous few years. And once tests are reformed, it suggests children should be provided with at least 10 hours free, or subsidised preparation for entrance tests, so applicants from all backgrounds are given an even chance of success. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: "Politicians of all parties have accepted that grammar schools are here to stay, and while their numbers are not growing, the number of pupils admitted to them has risen by a quarter, or 30,000, since 1997 and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead. "Some grammar schools are working to improve access, and grammar schools in Northern Ireland have a far better record than English grammar schools." In his foreword to the report, he said: "The challenge to the sector and for those areas where a selective system prevails is how to ensure that those grammar schools are open to all, and are not simply a preserve of better-off families who can afford private tutors or prep schools fees." He added: "We need fairer tests and there should be a minimum of 10 hours free or subsidised test preparation for all applicants to provide a more level playing field." But National Grammar Schools Association chairman Robert McCartney said the fact that three-quarters of England had no grammar school meant that it was not fair to compare national figures on pupils on free school meals. He added that the report makes clear that grammar schools are a good thing and they are not going to go away. "Clearly since 1997 there have been an additional 30,000 pupils at the 164 grammar schools in England. That really means something like an extra 30 grammar schools with pupils of 1,000 each." He welcomed the idea that grammar schools provide test preparation classes to all pupils, but said it was impossible to design a written test that was not amenable to coaching. However, he agreed that many pupils found their way into grammar schools because they had been heavily coached for the tests. He added: "Grammar school heads report that many pupils have been totally over-coached and begin to struggle further up the school." He said the reason that this coaching industry had come about was because of the "paucity of grammar school places in England". The Department for Education did not wish to comment on the report. </body>

      <description>Ofsted criticises educational attainment in Suffolk, saying standards in schools are "unacceptable".</description>

      <body>Ofsted has criticised educational attainment in Suffolk, saying standards in schools are "unacceptable". A letter to the county council follows inspections of 33 schools in September, prompted by concerns about overall education standards. Ofsted said there had been no overall increase in the number of good or outstanding schools in Suffolk. Suffolk County Council said recent Key Stage 2 and GCSE results showed it was "making progress". The council said its Raising The Bar programme had been designed to boost achievement in schools, but Ofsted found it was "regarded with varying degrees of credibility" by head teachers. The initiative was introduced in 2012 to try and improve standards, as figures revealed the county performed worse than comparable local education authorities (LEAs). The latest league tables showed that, out of 150 LEAS, Suffolk was in the bottom 10 for GCSE results and third from bottom for primary school performance. Ofsted said in its inspection of 33 schools in September, nearly a fifth were judged to be inadequate. Sean Harford, Ofsted regional director, said: "This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages. "The lack of progress of previously 'satisfactory' schools means that pupils in these schools still do not have access to a good quality of education. "This will be of great concern to parents, carers and pupils alike." Ofsted said that the number of schools that had improved to 'good' or 'better' had gone up, but not at the pace as the rest of the country. Inspectors found there were examples of effective intervention by the LEA, but it was "equally clear" some intervention had not been early enough. Last month, Suffolk County Council said it was going to approve a £2.4m spending package as part of its Raising the Bar school improvement policy. Ofsted said it also carried out a survey of head teachers of good or outstanding schools and its findings showed that, although they were aware of Raising The Bar, opinion was split on its credibility. Some head teachers said they had not been approached about playing a role in supporting other schools. Graham White, National Union of Teachers branch secretary for Suffolk, said: "Teaching standards are OK. "However, there are always going to be some that are really good and some that are less good. "We've got some outstanding teachers, heads and advisors in Suffolk, but we need to use them to much better effect." Ben Gummer, Conservative MP for Ipswich, said it was a "very helpful intervention" by Ofsted. "The same system of targets exists across the country and it has not stopped other areas improving more quickly than Suffolk," he said. "There are some exceptional teachers and good practice needs to be spread to the rest and that has to happen now rather than spread over a couple of years." A Suffolk County Council spokesperson said: "Improving educational attainment in Suffolk is the county council's top priority. "We're focused on making sure every child in Suffolk has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, which includes going to a good or outstanding school. "Through our Raising the Bar programme, we're working with and challenging schools to drive up educational attainment. "The latest Key Stage 2 and GCSE results show that Suffolk is making progress in the direction." </body>

      <title>'Student fees may reach £20,000'</title>
      <description>Some universities may charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor tells the Times Higher Education magazine.</description>

      <body>Some universities may eventually charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor has told the Times Higher Education magazine. Tuition fees paid by home students at English institutions are capped at £9,000, overseas students pay more. The sector may start to see both groups the same way, says Prof Nick Petford, of Northampton University His comments come as a report argues that universities will need more money to cope as demand for places rises. The report, published on Thursday by the umbrella group Universities UK (UUK), says that higher fees charged by universities since last year have merely replaced cuts to government funding. Some forecasts predict that the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000 within the next 20 years. The report says this means institutions will need extra money to invest in buildings and facilities if they are to compete with universities in other countries. Many universities are already relying on sources of income other than fees or government money to pay for new building projects, it says. Prof Petford is the third university vice-chancellor to argue that the cap on annual fees, currently set at a maximum of £9,000, will need to rise. Last week UUK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden urged the government to allow fees to keep pace with inflation. In September the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Prof Andrew Hamilton, said fees should be related to the true cost of a degree - or £16,000 in the case of Oxford. Both said that some universities and departments were losing money, particularly on expensive courses such as science, technology or engineering. Prof Petford argues that some universities "with high brand value will be able to charge £17,000, £18,000 or £20,000 in the future - I am sure of that". "If you look at international students that's been a pretty much unregulated market since we've been recruiting overseas students," he said. "Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour. "The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way." He agrees that universities could increasingly find themselves short of cash if the government maintains the £9,000 cap on fees. "It is quite easy to do a financial forecast which shows that if the cap remains at £9,000 in the next decade, a number of universities, including ours, could potentially be in financial difficulty." Prof Petford acknowledges it would not be easy for any political party to adopt a tuition fee rise as policy in the run-up to the next election. He said: "As a vote winner, it's just not going to work is it?" Any change in tuition fees would have to be agreed by Parliament. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills maintains that the current £9,000 maximum fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching and to invest in improved teaching facilities, while ensuring that going to university remains affordable for students. </body>

      <title>Global tests for schools in England</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in England will be able to compare their standards with top Asian countries, as individual schools are able to take international Pisa tests.</description>

      <body>Individual secondary schools in England will be able to take influential international tests to see how they compare with the highest performing schools in Asia and Europe. OECD Pisa tests are used to measure and compare the educational standards of developed countries around the world. But from next year individual schools will be able to test their 15-year-old pupils in reading, maths and science. It will allow schools to see how their pupils rank against global standards. Education Minister Liz Truss said it was an "excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems". Essex County Council said it is encouraging its schools to take part. Next month will see the publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) international league tables, based on Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. These performance tables, which have become important international benchmarks, are published every three years, based on tests taken by a sample of schools in each country. The OECD says that such school standards are an important indicator for future economic performance. Asian countries have dominated the top places in recent test results, with Scandinavian countries among the high flyers in Europe. The UK has been a middle ranking performer, but within this national figure there will be a wide range of differences in ability, depending on region and type of school. It has raised questions such as how cities such as London might compare with New York or Paris, if there was data beyond the national level. The OECD is now going to allow individual schools in England to take the tests, so that they can see whether they are as good as pupils in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Finland, or whether they are falling behind the global competition. Making the test available will "enable individual schools in England for the first time to see where they stand internationally", says the OECD's education chief, Andreas Schleicher. "This will help teachers and school leaders understand where to focus their efforts to raise standards and learn from successful school systems in other countries." Schools will be given an overall test score, rather than a breakdown of individual pupils. And the school scores, from tests that take about two and a half hours, will not be published by the OECD. The test papers will be marked externally. Earlier this year this type of individual school testing was announced for the United States. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "It is down to secondary schools themselves to decide whether they want to take part in these tests run by a highly respected, independent organisation. "We see this is an excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems - and potentially against other schools from around the world." Ray Gooding, Essex County Council's cabinet member for education, said: "I will actively be encouraging Essex schools to take part to benefit from the ability to assess performance, share best practice and improve learning across the county." </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <title>Academy chains 'should face Ofsted'</title>
      <description>A report from the Education Select Committee says Ofsted should be given powers to inspect sponsors of groups of academies.</description>

      <body>Ofsted should be given powers to inspect organisations that run chains of academies, says a report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The Education Select Committee wants to improve the way groups of schools work together in partnerships. More than half of secondary schools in England are now academies, operating outside local authority control. Graham Stuart, committee chairman, said schools needed clearer incentives to "look beyond their own school gate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously said he believes that sponsors of such academy chains should face inspections. A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted already inspects all school and academy performance, while the Department for Education examines the performance of chains. "Where academies are underperforming, we take action - this can involve issuing a pre-warning notice and ultimately changing the sponsor if there is no improvement." The report by MPs has examined partnerships and co-operation between schools, against a background of greater school autonomy and different levels of accountability. Mr Stuart says his committee supports giving schools "more freedom to innovate" but there also needs to be a "degree of co-ordination". "Otherwise there is a danger that many schools will operate in isolation rather than in co-operation," said Mr Stuart. The report says that while there is widespread support for the idea of raising standards through greater collaboration there is still a lack of incentive for schools to work together. It argues that local authorities have a "critical role" in improving schools and calls on the government to clarify how they can act as brokers between local schools. But with the expansion of academies, it says that academy chains will play an increasingly important part in helping schools to improve. It warns of the need for co-ordination from this "middle tier", between individual schools and central government, particularly in areas where schools are at risk of underperforming. The Education Select Committee MPs say that academy chains should be open to inspection by Ofsted, in the way that local authorities can be inspected. The committee also argues there should be a mechanism to allow outstanding schools to leave academy chains, including without the approval of the organisation running the chain. The MPs also raise concerns that some outstanding academies are not providing support for weaker neighbouring schools and the report calls for closer monitoring. Sir Michael Wilshaw, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, told MPs that there needed to be a level playing field in the accountability of organisations running groups of schools. "We will be inspecting local authorities and we should inspect academy chains as well, if we identify underperformance," said the Ofsted chief. "I have made that clear to the secretary of state. It is only fair and equitable that we do that. We have not got the same powers at the moment, but I look forward to receiving the powers to do that." Sir Michael told MPs that there was an "ongoing discussion" with the Department for Education, but he thought the principle had been accepted. He also backed the idea that academy chains could be ranked in performance tables in the same way as local authorities. There are now 3,444 academies, representing 53% of secondary schools and 9% of primaries in England. Among these there are 1,600 schools in academy chains, up from fewer than 900 in autumn 2012. "Hundreds of schools are now collaborating on a scale never witnessed before - brilliant heads and teachers are working together, sharing best practice and driving improvement throughout the system, raising standards for their pupils," said a Department for Education spokesman. Labour's schools minister Kevin Brennan said: "Labour has long argued that collaboration between schools is what is needed if we are to deliver a step-change in standards across all schools. In June, we said that all schools would have to demonstrate effective collaboration with weaker schools for them to be rated as outstanding by Ofsted. "This report - by a cross-party group of MPs - is a damning indictment of David Cameron's schools policy that drives competition between schools instead of incentivising partnerships between them." </body>

      <description>A female drama teacher is banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex and having 'inappropriate and sexually explicit' conversations with other children.</description>

      <body>A female drama teacher has been banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex. Lindsay Black, 28, sent texts, emails and Facebook messages to the boy, 17, who played a lead role in the school play "We Will Rock You". She asked him to meet up for sex after class at St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Newport. The disciplinary panel in Cardiff heard she had "inappropriate and sexually explicit" talks with other pupils. Miss Black asked her sixth form class "Who's a virgin?" and made pupils stand-up if they had not had sex. She also played a game called "I have never" with the pupils where she would ask them if they had performed sex acts. The hearing was told Miss Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts in class. The schoolboy, known as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Miss Black as he rehearsed. English teacher Abigail Watts said: "I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. "They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A - she told him she had a dream about them having sex. "They had not met up but they had been talking about it." Trained actress Miss Black met the teenager while working on maternity cover at the school. She contacted him on Facebook and asked about his coursework, then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even asked the boy's girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told how Miss Black would spend time in classes talking to the students about sex acts. When Miss Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get them into "character". Colleague Sandra Davies said: "Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. "She said she wanted to cheat on her fiance once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class." Ms Davies added the pupils played the "I have never" game. "She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question," she added. The hearing in Cardiff was told how the boy's academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels. Ms Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action was taken. She did not attend the hearing but admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via social networking website Facebook. Ms Black denied talking to her class about sex and said the pupils had made up the allegations. But the panel found she had held discussions of an "inappropriate and sexually explicit nature" with Year 12 children. The panel found her actions amounted to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching. Committee chairman Peter Williams said: "The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. "Black's actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher." Paul Bennett, chair of governors at St Joseph's, said the school took allegations of unprofessional conduct "very seriously". He added: "The allegations were handled in line with the appropriate procedures. The school referred the matter to the General Teaching Council for Wales as it was required to do." </body>

      <body>An early indication of autism can be identified in babies under six months old, a study suggests. US researchers, writing in Nature, analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism initially developed normally but showed diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - between two and six months of age. A UK expert said the findings raise hope for early interventions. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long condition, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <title>A second language may delay dementia</title>
      <description>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual.</description>

      <body>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual, according to a study. Scientists examined almost 650 dementia patients and assessed when each one had been diagnosed with the condition. They found people who spoke two or more languages experienced a later onset of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. The bilingual advantage extended to illiterate people. The scientists said it confirmed the observed effect was not caused by differences in formal education. The study was by Edinburgh University and Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in India. It is the largest study so far to gauge the impact of bilingualism on the onset of dementia, independent of a person's education, gender, occupation and whether they live in a city or in the country, all of which have been examined as potential factors influencing the onset of dementia. The team of researchers said further studies were needed to determine the mechanism, which causes the delay in the onset of dementia. The researchers suggested bilingual switching between different sounds, words, concepts, grammatical structures and social norms constituted a form of natural brain training, which was likely to be more effective than any artificial brain training programme. However, studies of bilingualism are complicated in that bilingual populations are often ethnically and culturally different from monolingual societies. In places like Hyderabad, bilingualism is part of everyday life, knowledge of several languages is the norm and monolingualism is an exception. Thomas Bak, of Edinburgh University's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences said: "These findings suggest that bilingualism might have a stronger influence on dementia than any currently available drugs. "This makes the study of the relationship between bilingualism and cognition one of our highest priorities." The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </body>

      <title>Music lessons 'sculpt the brain'</title>
      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois, US. As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. Commenting on the study, Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas, who was not involved with the research, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." </body>

      <title>Biggest educator you've never heard of</title>
      <description>The biggest education provider you've never heard of</description>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <title>Students offered paid internships</title>
      <description>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates.</description>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <title>Engineering gap 'constrains' economy</title>
      <description>The UK's economic recovery could be constrained by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser.</description>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <description>Three single mothers and their children lose a challenge to the government's benefits cap, with the High Court ruling it does not breach their human rights.</description>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <title>Internet chat 'has a positive side'</title>
      <description>Experts say there should be greater focus on the positive effect internet forums and chatrooms can have.</description>

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <body>The former prime minister John Major told a meeting at the South Norfolk Conservative Association that the dominance of a private school elite in the upper echelons of British life is truly shocking, according to the Telegraph. The paper has quoted him as saying: "Our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they are born, not lock them in." Speaking to the Today programme, Harry Mount, author and blogger for the Telegraph, who attended private school and went to Oxford University himself, believes it is "staggeringly unfair'" that the higher echelons are dominated by privately-educated individuals. "I think the obvious thing to return and bring back grammar schools," he added. Owen Jones, author and columnist for the Independent, who attended a state school and also went to Oxford University, said: "Comprehensive education often gets scapegoated for the wider social inequalities in society - which are driving the fact that better-off students do better in school, than those from poorer backgrounds."

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24833198</url>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <title>Can US universities learn from India?</title>
      <description>Should the US learn from India's technology students</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24743439</url>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy, the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentle man". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>A new "broadband" invisibility cloak which hides objects over a wide range of frequencies has been devised. Despite the hype about Harry Potter-style cloaks, our best current designs can only conceal objects at specific wavelengths of light or microwaves. At other frequencies, invisibility cloaks actually make things more visible, not less, US physicists found. Their solution is a new ultrathin, electronic system, which they describe in Physical Review Letters. "Our active cloak is a completely new concept and design, aimed at beating the limits of [current cloaks] and we show that it indeed does," said Prof Andrea Alu, from the University of Texas at Austin. "If you want to make an object transparent at all angles and over broad bandwidths, this is a good solution. "We are looking into realising this technology at the moment, but we are still at the early stages." While the popular image of an invisibility cloak is the magical robe worn by Harry Potter, there is another kind which is not so far-fetched. The first working model - which concealed a small copper cylinder by bending microwaves around it - was first demonstrated in 2006. It was built with a thin shell of metamaterials - artificial composites whose structures allow properties which do not exist in nature. Cloaking materials could have applications in the military, microscopy, biomedical sensing, and energy harvesting devices. The trouble with current designs is they only work at limited bandwidths. Even this "perfect" 3D cloak demonstrated last year could only hide objects from microwaves. At other frequencies the cloak acts as a beacon - making the hidden object more obvious - as Prof Alu and his team have now demonstrated in a new study in Physical Review X. They looked at three popular types of "passive" cloaks - which do not require electricity - a plasmonic cloak, a mantle cloak, and a transformation-optics cloak. All three types scattered more waves than the bare object they were trying to hide - when tested over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. "If you suppress scattering in one range, you need to pay the price, with interest, in some other range," Prof Alu told BBC News. "For example, you might make a cloak that makes an object invisible to red light. But if you were illuminated by white light (containing all colours) you would actually look bright blue, and therefore stand out more." A cloak that allows complete invisibility is "impossible" with current passive designs, the study concluded. "When you add material around an object to cloak it, you can't avoid the fact that you are adding matter, and that this matter still responds to electromagnetic waves," Prof Alu explained. Instead, he said, a much more promising avenue is "active" cloaking technology - designs which rely on electrical power to make objects "vanish". Active cloaks can be thinner and less conspicuous than passive cloaks. Alu's team have proposed a new design which uses amplifiers to coat the surface of the object in an electric current. This ultrathin cloak would hide an object from detection at a frequency range "orders of magnitude broader" than any available passive cloaking technology, they wrote. Prof David Smith of Duke University, one of the team who created the first cloak in 2006, said the new design was one of the most detailed he had yet seen. "It's an interesting implementation but as presented is probably a bit limited to certain types of objects," he told BBC News. "There are limitations even on active materials. It will be interesting to see if it can be experimentally realised." Prof Smith points out that even an "imperfect" invisibility cloak might be perfectly sufficient to build useful devices with real-world applications. For example, a radio-frequency cloak could improve wireless communications - by helping them bypass obstacles and reducing interference from neighbouring antennas. "To most people, making an object 'invisible' means making it transparent to visible wavelengths. And the visible spectrum is a tiny, tiny sliver of the overall electromagnetic spectrum," he told BBC News. "So, this finding does not necessarily preclude the Harry Potter cloak, nor does it preclude any other narrow bandwidth application of cloaking." </body>

      <title>Falkland farewell for 'Space Ferrari'</title>
      <description>The final moments of Europe's Goce satellite were caught on camera as it blazed across the sky above the South Atlantic.</description>

      <body>The final moments of the Goce satellite were caught on camera as it blazed across the sky above the South Atlantic. Falkland Islander Bill Chater managed to record the scene as he returned from a day's outing to see penguins. “We saw what we first thought was a shooting star,” Bill told me. “It soon became obvious it was the satellite we had heard about on BBC Radio News an hour before. “It left a long trail of smoke which was bright white in the dark sky, presumably lit by the Sun which we could no longer see.” Goce's fall to Earth on Sunday night made it the first European Space Agency (Esa) mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry into the atmosphere in more than 25 years. Esa has looked at the pictures acquired on East Falkland and says they represent - "in all likelihood" - the destructive end of its one-tonne probe. Dubbed the "Ferrari of space" because of its sleek Italian design, Goce had spent the past four years making precise maps of Earth's gravity. Its plunge through the atmosphere on Sunday became inevitable once the electric engine it had employed to stay in orbit ran out of fuel. Tracking systems were deployed to monitor the rapid descent, with a final estimate for the location of the re-entry put close to the tip of South America, just east of Tierra Del Fuego. American military data timed this event to have occurred at 00:16 GMT, or 21:16 local Falkland time - just as Bill, his wife Vicky, and dad, Tony Chater, were making their way home after spending the day with King Penguins. “We were returning home from Volunteer Point,” says Bill. “It was just getting dark following a long, spectacular sunset and as we came over Wall Mountain, heading south, we saw what we first thought was a shooting star. “It was leaving a thick white trail of smoke and split into a couple of bits, before again breaking up into several smaller parts which all flew over our heads and disappeared northwards over Wall Mountain behind us.” The description of the event fits, as does the location and timing. The direction of the fireballs – moving south to north – also matches what would have been Goce’s death trajectory. Bill says he has video of the event but cannot share it because of the islands’ slow internet connection. Goce started its descent from an operational altitude of 224km, and took a total of three weeks to fall to Earth. The thermal and mechanical stresses that ultimately tore the satellite apart would have begun to take hold while it was still 80km from the Earth's surface. Experts had suggested some 200-250kg could have survived all the way down. If they did, these twisted and charred materials are now at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. It was a violent end for one of the most delicate and sensitive space instruments ever built. Goce’s data lives on, however. Its exquisite maps of the subtle variations in gravity across the surface of the Earth will influence a diverse array of disciplines - from ocean and climate research to geology and civil engineering. </body>

      <body>The head of the Philippines delegation at UN climate talks in Poland has said he will stop eating until participants make "meaningful" progress. In an emotional speech, Yeb Sano linked the "staggering" devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan to a changing climate. Mr Sano said he was speaking on behalf of those who lost their lives in the storm and his fast would last until "we stop this madness". His speech brought tears to the eyes of other delegates and a standing ovation. Mr Sano said the typhoon had made land near his home area, and he had just had word that members of his family had survived. At the opening of the two-week Conference of the Parties (Cop), Mr Sano said he was not just speaking for those who lost their lives but for the thousands who were now orphans. He told the meeting he would refuse to eat until progress is made. "In solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food back home, I will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate, this means I will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this Cop, until a meaningful outcome is in sight." "What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness, the climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness right here in Warsaw," he said. Mr Sano's intervention unleashed a wave of emotion in the normally staid surroundings of the UN conference. China proposed three minutes of silence in memory of the victims. Delegates stood, some with tears in their eyes as they reflected on the scale of human loss in the super storm. Earlier the UN's climate chief, Christiana Figueres, had opened the meeting saying the typhoon was part of the "sobering reality" and negotiators should go the "extra mile" in their efforts. Speaking at the conference centre at the national football stadium in Warsaw, Ms Figueres reminded the delegates that climate change was not a game. "There are no winners and losers, we all either win or lose in the future we make for ourselves." Participants from small island states said the typhoon served as a stark reminder of "the cost of inaction". In a statement, Olai Ngedikes the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) said that the storm should motivate the work in Warsaw. She said that discussions on the issue of loss and damage, a key element for developing countries, must proceed at pace. "It has become clear that there are now impacts from climate change that can no longer be avoided. "It is therefore essential that we establish an international mechanism on loss and damage here in Warsaw and address this crisis once and for all," she said. Despite their sympathy for the situation in the Philippines, developed nations are likely to resist a formal, legal basis for future loss and damage claims associated with climate change.

      <body>India's mission to Mars has overcome a technical problem and appears to be back on track, the country's space research agency says. The problem occurred on Monday when a planned engine burn failed to raise the spacecraft's orbit around Earth by the intended amount. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has now pushed the spacecraft to a higher velocity as planned. Isro officials said its final orbit "will be known in a few hours". The problem occurred during a manoeuvre designed to boost the craft's maximum distance from 71,623km to 100,000km. A problem with the liquid fuel thruster caused the 1,350kg vehicle to fall short of the mark. As a solution, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) - known informally as Mangalyaan, or Mars-craft - executed an additional thruster firing to make up for the shortfall early on Tuesday. Speaking to Pallava Bagla, science editor at Indian broadcasting network NDTV, Isro's chairman K Radhakrishnan said: "All is well and operations completed as planned. The final orbit of the spacecraft will be known in a few hours." Mr Bagla told BBC News that the "spacecraft has been put on required velocity and seems to be on track". Instead of flying directly to Mars, the $72m (£45m) probe is scheduled to orbit Earth until the end of the month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. </body>

      <title>Biodiversity plans 'too simplistic'</title>
      <description>The government's biodiversity offsetting plans are too simplistic and need to be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs warn.</description>

      <body>Biodiversity offsetting plans outlined by the government must be strengthened if they are to "properly protect Britain's wildlife", MPs have warned. The scheme aims to ensure that when a development causes unavoidable damage to biodiversity, "new, bigger or better nature sites will be created". But the MPs say the assessment proposed by ministers appears to be little more than a "box-ticking exercise". Six areas are taking part in a two-year pilot, which began in April 2012. Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) chairwoman Joan Walley MP said many witnesses that gave evidence to the EAC's inquiry had voiced concerns that key habitats - such as ancient woodlands and Sites of Special Scientific Interest - would be included in the government's offsetting plans. 'Not adequate' "There is a danger that an overly simplistic offsetting system would not protect these long-established ecosystems," she added. "Biodiversity offsetting could improve the way our planning system accounts for the damage developments do to wildlife, if it is done well. "The assessment process currently proposed by the government appears to be little more than a 20-minute box-ticking exercise that is simply not adequate to assess a site's year-round biodiversity. Ms Walley explained: "If a 20-minute assessment was carried out in a British wood in winter, for instance, it would be easy to overlook many of the migratory birds that may use it as habitat in summer." However, in their report, the MPs acknowledged that it was "too soon to reach a decision" on offsetting while the pilot schemes had yet to be completed and independently evaluated. But they added that they were publishing their report now as ministers were considering submissions made during a public consultation on the proposals. The consultation on how the scheme would be rolled-out across England closed last week and officials are now considering the submissions. Responding to the EAC's findings, National Trust natural environment director Simon Pryor said the MPs' report showed that the government had to take its time to ensure to get the scheme right. "Offsetting could be a positive way to help avoid the loss of wildlife that can result from development - but only if it is done properly," he observed. "If a system is introduced too rapidly, and without adequate testing and evidence, the prospect of a workable and supportable biodiversity offsetting system would be undermined for many years to come." In its consultation document, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said that England faced "the twin challenges of growing its economy and improving its natural environment", adding: "We will not achieve these goals unless our planning system is fit-for-purpose." A Defra spokesman told BBC News: "Biodiversity offsetting could help improve our environment as well as boost the economy. "This report, along with other consultation responses, will help us get the detail of the policy right," he explained. "We will formally respond to the report in due course." A number of reports, produced by the Ecosystem Markets Task Force and the Natural Capital Committee, had identified biodiversity offsetting as a way of delivering a sustainable planning system. However, an independent review of England's wildlife sites, led by Prof Sir John Lawton, concluded in September 2010 that biodiversity offsetting must not become a "licence to destroy" or damage existing habitat of recognised value. "In other words, offsets must only be used to compensate for genuinely unavoidable damage," the review recommended. Defra said that offsetting schemes had been adopted in more than 20 countries, including Australia, Germany, India and the US, as a means of protecting biodiversity. Ms Walley also observed that the pilot schemes, which are scheduled to run until April 2014, had "not had a good take-up". "That suggests that these sorts of schemes need to be mandatory, but the government should exercise some caution about this because the pilots need to be rigorously and independently assessed first to make sure all the lesson are properly taken on board". </body>

      <body>A camel has tested positive for the Sars-like virus that emerged in the Middle East last year and has killed 64 people worldwide. The animal had been owned by a person diagnosed with Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, the Saudi health ministry said. It remains unclear, however, if camels are responsible for passing the disease to humans. Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in humans and animals. It is possible the virus is spread in droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Experts believe the virus is not very contagious - if it were, we would have seen more cases. Globally, since September 2012, there have been 153 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Mers coronavirus. The Saudi government statement said "preliminary" laboratory checks had proved positive. The health ministry said it was working with the ministry of agriculture and laboratories to "isolate the virus and compare its genetic structure with that of the patient's". If the virus carried by the camel and that of the patient "prove to be identical, this would be a first scientific discovery worldwide, and a door to identify the source of the virus", it added. The World Health Organization, which has been monitoring the global situation, says there is currently no reason to impose any travel restrictions because of the virus. </body>

      <body>Disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong has told the BBC he will testify with "100% transparency and honesty" at any future inquiry into doping. But the American, 42, wants assurances he will be treated fairly after admitting in January he took performance-enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour de France wins. He argues some of those involved in cycling's culture of doping have been given "a total free pass", while others have received "the death penalty". Accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency of conducting "the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme sport has ever seen", Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France titles in August 2012. The Texan, who overcame cancer before the first of his seven successive Tour "wins" in 1999, also handed back the bronze medal he won in the road time trial at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In a 20-minute interview with the BBC's World Service's Newshour programme, Armstrong said his life had "been tough" following his high-profile television confession to American chat show host Oprah Winfrey at the start of the year. He also spoke of the mounting threat to his vast fortune, reported to be about $125m (£78m) at its peak, as people seek redress for the lies he told. "It's been tough," he said. "It's been real tough. I've paid a high price in terms of my standing within the sport, my reputation, certainly financially because the lawsuits have continued to pile up. "I have experienced massive personal loss, massive loss of wealth, while others have truly capitalised on this story." Asked if he regretted doing the interview with Winfrey, he responded: "I was going to have to answer the questions anyway. "There were plenty of lawsuits in place that would have put me in the cross-hairs." Armstrong said what he wanted now was consistency from those attempting to find out the true extent of the doping. "If everyone gets the death penalty, then I'll take the death penalty," he said. "If everyone gets a free pass, I'm happy to take a free pass. If everyone gets six months, then I'll take my six months." Brian Cookson, the new president of the UCI - cycling's world governing body, said there will be an independent commission to try to unearth how much cheating there had been. The Englishman is keen the commission hears evidence from a large number of people, not just Armstrong, as he attempts to restore cycling's credibility and that of his own organisation, which has faced allegations of corruption. Armstrong said he would do whatever he could to "close the chapter and move things forward", conceding he did not have "a whole lot of credibility" but also insisting he had "nothing to lose". He has previously questioned the role of the UCI, claiming "there were things that were a little shady" at the time. However, he told the BBC any revelations might not be "quite as juicy" as people think. Armstrong, who finally retired from cycling in 2011 after initially quitting in 2005, also issued a warning about the inquiry itself, arguing the logistics would be problematic both "legally and internationally". He also questioned how much good attempting to find out the truth would do. "Do I think that this process has been good for cycling?" he asked. "No. I don't think our sport has been served well by going back 15 years. "I don't think that any sport, or any political scenario, is well served going back 15 years. And if you go back 15 years, you might as well go back 30." As for whether cycling is clean now, Armstrong insisted he had "no idea". However, he argued that "performance enhancement" has been around since the ancient Greeks and there would "always be some form of it", adding the World Anti-Doping Agency had a "hard" job keeping up with the cheats "because of the development of pharmaceuticals". Armstrong would not be drawn on whether it was time for a radical approach to drugs in sport, perhaps permitting thresholds rather than outright bans. "That's way above my pay-grade to try to decide that," he said. "I'll let those people who pretend to be, or who are the experts, try to decide that." </body>

      <title>Chemical ban linked to warming pause</title>
      <description>A new study links a ban on the uses of ozone depleting chemicals to a hiatus in temperature rises since the mid 1990s.</description>

      <body>A new study suggests that the ban on ozone depleting chemicals may have also impacted the rise in global temperatures. CFC gases were responsible for a massive hole in the ozone layer but they also had a powerful greenhouse effect. The authors link a ban on their use to a "pause" or slowdown in temperature increases since the mid 1990s. The research is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. The subject of a hiatus or standstill in global temperatures rises since 1998 has been the subject of intense debate among scientists, and it has been used as a key argument by some to show that the impacts of global warming have been exaggerated. There have been a number of theories as to why the rise in emissions from CO2 and other gases has not been mirrored in temperatures since the late 1990s. These include increases in China's use of coal, changes in solar output, and the impact of the El Nino weather cycle. One report earlier this year suggested that it was caused by long-term changes in the warming of waters in the eastern Pacific. Now this latest piece of research says that it has been caused by attempts to protect the ozone layer. A team of researchers carried out a statistical analysis on the connection between rising temperatures and rates of increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere between 1880 and 2010. They concluded that changes in the warming rate can be attributed to specific human actions that affected greenhouse gas concentrations. They were able to show that when emissions were reduced during both world wars and the Great Depression, temperature rises also stalled. They also argue that the introduction of the Montreal Protocol, originally signed in 1987 by 46 countries, had an impact on global temperatures as well. The treaty phased out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These chemicals, used as spray can propellants and in refrigeration, had helped thin the ozone layer over Antarctica. But CFCs were not just damaging the ozone layer, they were also having a warming impact, as they are 10,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide and can last up to 100 years in the atmosphere. Their removal, say the authors, was a critical factor in the slowdown. "Our analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, as well as a reduction in methane emissions, contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s," the authors write. In a commentary on the research, Felix Pretis and Prof Myles Allen from Oxford University suggest that the CFC ban is "unlikely to be the whole story", but they acknowledge it did make a difference. "The impact of this change is small but not negligible: without the reduction in CFC emissions, temperatures today could have been almost 0.1C warmer than they actually are."

      <body>A US company that has developed an "electronic backpack" that fits onto a cockroach allowing its movements to be controlled by a mobile phone app has defended itself against cruelty claims. The Backyard Brains company says that the device is intended to get children to be interested in neuroscience. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the device - being formally launched on Saturday - was not a gimmick. But critics say that the company's stance is "disingenuous". For the "electronic backpack" to work the cockroaches have to be placed in icy water to subdue them before sandpaper is used to remove the waxy coating on the shell of the insect's head. An electrode connector and electrodes are then glued on to the insect's body and a needle is used to poke a hole in their thorax in order to insert a wire. Their antennae are then cut and electrodes are inserted. A circuit is attached to their backs, and signals are received through a mobile phone app allowing users to control the cockroaches' movements to the left and to the right. Animal behaviour scientist Jonathan Balcombe has been quoted on US scientific websites as saying that the insects are harmed in the process. "If it was discovered that a teacher was having students use magnifying glasses to burn ants and then look at their tissue, how would people react?" he is quoted as saying. Likewise Queen's University philosophy Professor Michael Allen warned that the device will "encourage amateurs to operate invasively on living organisms" and "encourage thinking of complex living organisms as mere machines or tools". The Michigan-based company has even received emails saying the the backpack - known as Roboroach - "teaches kids to be psychopaths". But Backyard Brains says that 20% of the world will soon have a neurological disorder - for which there are no known cures - and the backpacks "allow students to do graduate level research early in life". A company spokeswoman told the BBC that the backpack had been developed solely to encourage children to take an interest in neuroscience which, she said, needed to be better taught in American schools. "At the moment this crucially important subject is woefully under-taught," she said, "with many schools teaching neuroscience within the biology syllabus when it should be a subject in its own right. "That is especially the case when diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's take a heavier toll within society." The spokeswoman insisted that the insects are treated humanely and that the backpack - first developed in 2011 - does not harm them. The backpack will be widely available in November in the US priced at $99 (£61). </body>

      <body>After a successful launch on Tuesday, India's Mars spacecraft has carried out the first of six crucial engine firings in Earth orbit. The probe performed the firing with its liquid fuel thruster at 19:47 GMT on Wednesday (Thursday 1:17 IST). The aim is to gradually build up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. If the firings succeed, the spacecraft will travel for 300 days, ready for entering Mars orbit in 2014. K. Radhakrishnan, head of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the Times of India that the spacecraft was in "excellent health". After lift-off, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was placed into an elliptical parking orbit around Earth with a perigee (the point in the orbit closest to Earth) of 248.4 km and an apogee (the point farthest away) of 23,550 km. The six major thruster firings are designed to manoeuvre the MOM into a so-called hyperbolic trajectory so that the probe escapes the Earth's sphere of influence. After a 10-month journey, the probe will arrive at Mars on 24 September next year. The engine will be fired again to slow down the spacecraft, enabling it to be captured by the planet's gravity and place it into Martian orbit. Four further manoeuvres between 8 and 16 November will raise the craft's apogee to 192,000km. "It's going to be a large sequence of events," said Mr Radhakrishnan. On 1 December, the engine will be fired again for its "trans-Martian injection", sending the craft on its way to the Red Planet. This week, Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News that the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. But any delay in these operations would require precious extra fuel to be used to catch up with the desired path to Mars. India's PSLV rocket - the second choice for the mission after a beefier launcher failed - was not powerful enough to send the MOM on a direct flight to Mars. So engineers opted for a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit to propel the spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel possible. At a cost of about $72m (£45m), the MOM is extremely cheap by the standards of planetary missions. Even so, some commentators have questioned whether India should be spending its millions on a planetary mission when a significant part of its population are in poverty and figures for childhood malnutrition are some of the highest in the world.

      <body>The Hubble telescope has spotted an asteroid radiating six comet-like tails, making it resemble a "rotating lawn sprinkler". Other asteroids appear as tiny points of light to astronomers, who are puzzled by the outbursts of dust. Asteroid P/2013 P5 has been ejecting dust periodically for at least five months and may be in the process of breaking up. They have outlined details in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," said Prof Dave Jewitt, from the University of California at Los Angeles. "Even more amazing, its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust. That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." Astronomers say it is possible the asteroid's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart. Radiation pressure from the Sun could have sent the space rock spinning, to a point where the asteroid's weak gravity could no longer hold it together. Astronomers will continue observing P/2013 P5 to see whether the dust leaves the asteroid in the equatorial plane. Because of the physics involved in the spin rate theory, say the astronomers, this would provide strong evidence for a rotational breakup. They do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once. Astronomers discovered the object in August, using the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii. At the time, P/2013 P5 looked unusually fuzzy. The multiple tails were discovered when Hubble was used to take a more detailed image on 10 September. </body>

      <title>Rat cull to 'save seabirds' begins</title>
      <description>Internationally important seabird populations on the Isles of Scilly are being protected by a scheme to kill more than 3,000 brown rats.</description>

      <body>A project aimed at protecting internationally important seabird populations on two of the Isles of Scilly by killing more than 3,000 brown rats, is under way. The islands, which are located off Cornwall, are home to breeding populations of 14 seabird species and approximately 20,000 birds. Eradication experts from New Zealand and the UK have been contracted to carry out the work. "Among many challenges our seabirds face, the greatest threat on land is predation of eggs and chicks by brown rats," said Jaclyn Pearson from the Isles of Scilly Seabird Recovery Project. "The brown rats were accidently introduced to islands from shipwrecks in the 18th Century," she added. The project is part of a 25-year programme to protect "internationally important" seabird numbers, including those of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, and is costing more than £755,000. The rodents will be poisoned on St Agnes and Gugh by Wildlife Management International Limited (WMIL). The company has helped eradicate rats from Ramsey Island off Wales, Lundy Island off Devon and the Isle of Canna in the Scottish Hebrides. Elizabeth Bell, from WMIL said: "A period of intensive baiting will start from the 8 November and most of the rats will be dead by the end of November. We'll then target the surviving rats." A long-term monitoring programme will start at the beginning of 2014 to check the rodents have been eradicated from the islands. Ms Bell said all the bait stations were enclosed, tied down and were designed not to kill any other species, such as rabbits. Ms Pearson said: "The project is 25 years in length, although the project team will disband after five years, for the remaining 20 years the community will continue to protect their seabird heritage, by keeping the islands 'rat-free'. "This includes correct waste management, ensuring bio-security on boats and freight to the islands, and of course, educating all visitors to the islands to be vigilant and 'rat on a rat'". "This is the largest community-based island restoration project attempted in the world to date, with 85 residents living here year round." She added that similar populated islands around the world hoped to learn from the project and carry out similar work to "safeguard their seabirds". A feasibility study estimated the population of brown rats on the Isles of Scilly was about 34,500, with 3,100 occurring on St Agnes and Gugh. Johnny Birks, chair of the Mammal Society, said: "Brown rats are not native to Britain... it's our own fault they are so widespread and that makes it right for us to repair the damage we've caused." He added that the eradication could benefit the Scilly shrew and other species found on the islands, but it was key that the rats did not reinvade. Ms Pearson added she was "certain" rats on neighbouring islands would not swim to St Agnes and Gugh. "The shortest distance over water from St Agnes and Gugh to an island which has rats, is between Gugh and the Garrison on St Mary's. "This distance of about one mile (1.6km) is just under the maximum distance a rat can swim in favourable conditions, but the deep channel, strong current and cold sea temperature all year round will make it highly unlikely that a rat can swim back." Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: "Eight out of ten islands around the world now have rats, including remote places such as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and Henderson Island in the South Pacific. "The predators are known to have impacted on the populations of 75 species of seabird, from albatross to shearwaters to small petrels. "In response, there is a worldwide effort to rid islands of these voracious creatures," he added. In January, Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) South West, said we have a "collective responsibility for the native wildlife on the Isles of Scilly". HLF has awarded the project £269,100, alongside £460,255 from the EU Life fund , with further contributions from Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Beauty Sustainable Development Fund and Natural England. </body>

      <title>'Space Ferrari' falls to Earth</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency's Goce gravity mapping satellite re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, burning up over the South Atlantic.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency's (Esa) Goce satellite has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, burning up in the process. US tracking data suggests any surviving debris fell into the South Atlantic, just off the tip of South America, south of the Falkland Islands. Dubbed the "Ferrari of space" because of its sleek looks, Goce is the first Esa mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry in more than 25 years. The gravity mapping probe's plunge was inevitable once it ran out of fuel. The mission was operating in an extremely low orbit - at 224km altitude, the lowest of any scientific satellite - and needed to constantly thrust an electric engine to stay aloft, but last month its reserves of xenon fuel were exhausted. Pre-return modelling had indicated that perhaps a fifth to a quarter of Goce's one-tonne mass could have endured the fiery fall through the atmosphere. Its sophisticated gradiometer - the instrument used to make gravity measurements - incorporated composite materials which were expected to ride out the destructive forces that would ordinarily incinerate traditional components. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee - the global forum on "space junk" - chose Goce as its special study project for 2013. This meant a large number of tracking and surveillance facilities around the world were activated to monitor the satellite's descent to Earth. A signal from Goce was last acquired at 22:42 GMT on Sunday as it passed 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica. Data from the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) indicated that re-entry occurred a little over one orbit of the Earth later, with the spacecraft starting to break up at 00:16 GMT on Monday at an altitude of about 80km. This would have put any debris fall in the South Atlantic just east of Tierra Del Fuego. "Goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict, this is not very surprising," Holger Krag from Esa's Space Debris Office told BBC News. Goce's slender, fin-shaped construction, combined with its magnetic attitude-control system, maintained a stable orientation until very late in the descent. Engineers monitoring the last hours of the satellite from Europe's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, observed Goce to keep a straight-on approach as it dipped deeper and deeper into the atmosphere. "This was due to the shape of Goce, which was designed in such a way that it was aerodynamically stabilised," said Dr Krag. Statistics show that there is typically at least one piece of tracked space "junk" re-entering the Earth's atmosphere every day; with, on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body coming back every week. Esa's last mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry was the magnetosphere explorer Isee-2, which came back in 1987. The agency does, however, regularly manage controlled re-entries. Its space station freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, can weigh some 13 tonnes when it comes back to Earth. It has fuel and thrusters to direct its destructive dive towards the vast and uninhabited waters of the Southern Ocean, east of New Zealand. Goce (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites. Its super-sensitive gradiometer was used to detect the tiny variations in the pull of gravity across the surface of the Earth. Its maps have very broad applications. The data is a key reference in civil engineering for relating heights measured at widely separated locations, and for the computer models that need to understand how the oceans move to forecast future changes in climate. </body>

      <body>A Soyuz capsule has returned to Earth, carrying the Sochi 2014 Olympic torch after it was taken on its first spacewalk as part of the Russian lead-up to the Winter Games. The torch landed in central Kazakhstan after leaving the International Space Station. Three astronauts delivered it back after a three-and-a-half hour descent. The torch was taken up to the ISS on Thursday and then waved outside the space station. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky posed for photographs as they held the torch 420km (260 miles) above Earth. The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it had never previously left a spaceship. The torch was unlit inside the ISS because of safety concerns and outside due to the lack of oxygen. A different crew - Russia's Fyodor Yurchikhin, Nasa US astronaut Karen Nyberg and Italian Luca Parmitano - bought it back to Earth, landing on the Kazakh steppes shortly before 08:50 (02:50 GMT) on Monday. The capsule descended to the ground under a parachute. Mr Yurchikhin, the mission commander, was carried from the capsule to a reclining chair and covered with blanket against the cold. The torch was removed from a protective bag and given to Mr Yurchikhin, who waved it and smiled for the cameras. The capsule completed a perfect descent and touched down exactly on time, according to a Nasa TV commentator. It will to be used to light the Olympic cauldron at the winter games in February next year. The trip to the space station is all part of elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It was seen as part of a rebranding exercise by Russia designed to portray it as a strong, modern country. The Games are the most expensive Olympics so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the Games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as by allegations from rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <title>Volcanic lava that flows for a year</title>
      <description>Researchers capture the first footage of the glacial flow of rocky obsidian lava, still flowing months after an eruption.</description>

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. To carry out their study, the team visited a volcano in the south of Chile called Cordon Caulle in January 2012. "There had just been an enormous eruption [in June 2011] that was still continuing," Dr Tuffen told BBC News. This explosive eruption produced rhyolite - the rock that creates the "incredibly sticky magma" that results in these strange obsidian flows. "This was our chance to get right in there and see an obsidian flow moving for the first time," he said. No-one had previously witnessed an obsidian flow moving. As well as witnessing the ongoing volcanic eruption, the researchers recorded the lava - a heaving mass of black rock more than 30m (100ft) thick - as it "slowly creaked its way down the mountain". Team member Prof Jonathan Castro from the University of Mainz in Germany captured footage and images of the flow. Piecing these images together produced a 3-D model of the obsidian flow's changing shape. "What was exciting was that it kept on going," said Dr Tuffen. "Even after the eruption had stopped - it was still flowing away many months afterwards." Initially, the lava advanced several metres per day, then as its thick rocky crust cooled, it slowed. But, according to Dr Tuffen's data, over a year after the eruption, the lava was still advancing at a rate of 1.5m to 3m per day. Crucially, the lava flow altered as pieces of the rocky mass collapsed and the hotter lava leaked out in what the scientists referred to as "breakouts". This, Dr Tuffen said, revealed "lots of secrets about how lavas advance". "So now we can make new models that can encompass all the different sorts of lavas on the planet and how they move." Dr William Burton, of the US Geological Survey, said: "What these guys have done is observe processes along the margins that may govern how these things flow - the breakouts. "Knowing what they learned in this paper may help predict where this flow is going to go next. "So if it is going close to a town you might be able to use some of the lessons they learned to [work out changes in its movement]." Dr Burton added that the most likely place for the next rhyolitic volcanic eruption was near Mono lake, in northern California - a popular ski area. Prof Peter Sammonds, an earth scientist from University College London, said the imaging techniques the team had developed would be "powerful" for the future study of volcanoes. "The modelling of these lava flows is quite important," he said. "These patterns can seen as a general feature [of volcanoes] - it doesn't simply relate to this one. Volcanoes that have produced rhyolitic eruptions are found all over the world, and have been some of the biggest on Earth. These include the US "supervolcano" eruptions at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and Novarupta in Alaska, which erupted in 1912 and was the biggest of the 20th Century. </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly discovered ligament identified in the knee may hold the key to common injuries, Belgian surgeons believe.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24826323</url>
      <date>1383811071</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70962000/png/_70962699_knee.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <title>Asteroid hit rate 'underestimated'</title>
      <description>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia this year has been underestimated, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia earlier this year is much higher than was previously thought, a study suggests. Researchers have found that space rocks of a similar size to the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk are hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere with surprising frequency. Scientists say early warning systems need to be put in place. The study is published in the journal Nature. Lead author Professor Peter Brown, from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action programme: "Having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the Earth, that probably is something worth doing. "In the case of Chelyabinsk, a few days' to a week's warning would have been valuable." Fireball The asteroid that exploded over Russia on 15 February this year was estimated to be about 19m-wide. It hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, sending a shockwave twice around the globe. It caused widespread damage and injured more than 1,000 people. Now though, scientists say there could be many more space rocks like this one on a collision course with the Earth. An international team looked at the last 20 years of data collected from sensors used by the US government and infrasound sensors positioned around the globe. These detectors are in place to detect the threat of nuclear weapons, but they can also capture the blasts caused by asteroid impacts. The researchers found that during this time about 60 asteroids up to 20m in size had smashed into the Earth's atmosphere: far more than was previously thought Most went undetected because they exploded over the ocean or in very remote areas. Prof Brown explained: "We were able to capture the occurrence rate you would expect of things like Chelyabinsk and smaller impacts. When you compare that to the numbers you get from telescopic [observations], our numbers are several times higher." This suggests that the risk from asteroids of this scale has been underestimated. The team estimates that the strike rate of asteroids that are tens of metres in size is between two and 10 times higher than was previously thought. "Something like Chelyabinsk, you would only expect every 150 years on the basis of the telescopic information. But when you look at our data and extrapolate from that, we see that these things seem to be happening every 30 years or so," said Prof Brown. An event such as the Tunguska impact in 1908, where an asteroid flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest in Siberia, would probably happen every few hundred years rather than every few thousand years, he added. Prof Brown said more effort should be made to create early warning systems. "There are literally millions of objects in the tens-of-metres-of-size range that we suspect are near Earth asteroids, that can get close to the Earth," he said. "We have only discovered over 1,000 of these. There are many more of these to find, but it would be very expensive to find all of these and it probably wouldn't make a lot of sense because the atmosphere largely stops them. "But what might make sense are systems that find something a few days or weeks before they hit... to tell you where on the Earth and when they will hit. That would allow some warning to be given to the civil defence authorities." In another study, also published in Nature, scientists believe they have traced the asteroid that the Chelyabinsk meteor splintered off from. They think it is a fragment of a 2km-wide rock called asteroid 86039. Professor Jiri Borovicka, from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said the orbits were "conspicuously similar", although the team could not prove "the common origin with absolute certainty".

      <body>A Soyuz rocket carrying the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has docked with the International Space Station, as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The rocket left Earth at 04:14:25 GMT. It blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It will not be lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew. The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <title>Forbidden City rocks carried on ice</title>
      <description>The huge stones that make up China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says.</description>

      <body>Huge stones that make up parts of China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says. That's despite the fact that wheeled vehicles had been developed 3,000 years earlier. The colossal city was built in the 15th Century by workers at the start of the Ming dynasty. Writing in PNAS journal, the team says that wood-on-ice sliding was more reliable than using wheels. Using sledges on ice was much more expensive and needed more workers but it was deemed a safer method than mule-powered transport. Howard Stone, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, said that on his first tour of the Forbidden City, he and colleagues were curious about how some of the huge stones had been transported. "There's a story on a sign that comments about an ice pack, so we started to investigate it," he told BBC News. "The funny thing about that sign is if you go to the leading scholarship on the science and technology of China, they don't indicate this as far as we can tell. "Most scholarly work indicates that the Chinese had the wheel in 1500 BC and the conclusion from that was they didn't have any need for sledges dragged by man. The Forbidden City was built 3,000 years later, so you have a contradiction. "So our suggestion is somehow that they didn't recognise the use of the artificial ice paths to drag these large rock carvings." But when the team translated a 500-year-old document from the historical record, they found a mention of huge stone carvings transported on ice. They then made calculations looking at the friction of ice to see how plausible it would be to drag such large rocks over the short time period in winter, when it was cold enough to do so. Prof Stone said several hundred workers would have been needed to transport stones ranging from 100-300 tonnes. "If you look at the frictional characteristics of ice for the rocks of this size, we estimate that 300 people were needed for this kind of dragging," he explained. Advance planning was also vital, as water had to be laid out in the winter months so it could freeze along the 43-mile (70km) stretch from a quarry outside Beijing. "They would dig wells every kilometre, pour water on the road which would give it a very smooth surface, The ice can support a lot of weight, they were then able to drag these objects," said Prof Stone. Other researchers say they were already aware of the use of ice to transport marble stone, but it had never been published in academic literature. Sally Church, from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University, had noticed the use of this method of moving marble after translating a Chinese book in 2007 called Stories of the Forbidden City. It was written in 1962, but based on earlier sources. The text said: "Really huge stones were moved on a contraption called a 'dry ship' or 'land ship'. Large pieces of wood were put together into a raft-like object, and there were two of these. "In very cold weather they poured water onto the roads and let it freeze, then either they or animals would pull it along." Dr Church said that it was "certainly new" and interesting to look at this topic from an engineering perspective. "It is just a small fact that lies buried in the sources in the subject. I would compare it to something like our knowing that the Tower of London once kept elephants and other exotic animals in a sort of zoo," she told BBC News. </body>

      <title>Fossil fuel subsidies 'are reckless'</title>
      <description>A new study suggests the world is spending seven times more money subsidising fossil fuels than fighting climate change in developing countries.</description>

      <body>The world is spending half a trillion dollars on fossil fuel subsidies every year, according to a new report. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) says rich countries are spending seven times more supporting coal, oil and gas than they are on helping poorer nations fight climate change. Some countries including Egypt, Morocco and Pakistan, have subsidies bigger than the national fiscal deficit. The new report calls on the G20 to phase out the payments by 2020. While there is no globally agreed definition of what a fossil fuel subsidy actually is, the report draws on a range of sources from the International Monetary Fund to the International Energy Agency. It details the range of financial help given to oil, coal and gas producers and consumers from national governments and through international development. What emerges is a complicated web of different types of payments in different countries. In the United States, for example, the government in 2011 gave a $1bn fuel tax exemption to farmers, $1bn for the strategic petroleum reserve and $0.5bn for oil, coal and gas research and development. Germany gave financial assistance totalling 1.9bn euro to the hard coal sector in the same year. And the UK gave tax concessions worth £280m in 2011 for oil and gas production. The report accuses rich governments of "shooting themselves in both feet" by undermining attempts to put a price on carbon and by giving no incentive to companies to switch from high carbon fuels. "This is a reckless use of public money at a time when people are very concerned about energy costs," Kevin Watkins, executive director of the ODI, told BBC News. "Why are we spending $112 per adult in the OECD countries subsidising an energy system that is driving us towards dangerous climate change when there are alternatives?" In developing countries, the report says the subsidies often take the form of keeping fuel prices low to help alleviate poverty. Governments in Indonesia, Pakistan and Venezuela are spending twice as much on fossil fuel subsidies as they are on public health. "Almost all these subsidies go to those who are connected to the grid because the governments give money to the energy providers, who pass it on to consumers. "The top 20% of these societies get around half of the total subsidy package," said Kevin Watkins. International finance for development is hugely focussed on oil, coal and gas. According to the ODI, 75% of energy project support from international banks went to fossil fuel projects in 12 of the highest emitting developing nations. The research adds to data from the International Energy Agency that says global subsidies for fossil fuels are six times higher than those for renewable energy. The OECD has stated that coal is subject to the lowest levels of taxation. The ODI hopes that enough countries in the G20 group will follow up on promises made to look at the issue. The institute believes that subsidies for energy are similar to subsidies for agriculture that plagued international trade negotiations in the 1990s. Ultimately, agreement was found on removing them. The ODI believes there can be a similar outcome for fuel supports. "This has to be the mother of all win-win scenarios," said Kevin Watkins. "You'd have a win for taxpayers, a win for governments north and south and you'd have a win for the planet as well." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24834697</url>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>Warming gases reach record high</title>
      <description>New data from the World Meteorological Organization says that atmospheric levels of CO2 and methane have broken new records.</description>

      <body>The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high in 2012. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric CO2 grew more rapidly last year than its average rise over the past decade. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide also broke previous records Thanks to carbon dioxide and these other gases, the WMO says the warming effect on our climate has increased by almost a third since 1990. The WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin measures concentrations in the atmosphere, not emissions on the ground. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the gases that they track, but only about half of the CO2 that's emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere, with the rest being absorbed by the plants, trees, the land and the oceans. Since 1750, global average levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased to 141% of the pre-industrial concentration of 278 parts per million (ppm). According to the WMO there were 393.1ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2012, an increase of 2.2ppm over 2011. This was above the yearly average of 2.02ppm over the past decade. "The observations highlight yet again how heat-trapping gases from human activities have upset the natural balance of our atmosphere and are a major contribution to climate change," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "It is a worry. The more we delay action the bigger the risk we cannot stay under the 2 degree Celsius limit that countries have agreed," he said. While the daily measurement of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded the symbolic 400ppm mark in May this year, according to the WMO the global annual average CO2 concentration will cross this point in 2015 or 2016. Levels of methane also reached record highs in 2012 of 1,819 parts per billion. Concentrations have been increasing since 2007 after a period when they appeared to be levelling off. The WMO report says that it is not yet possible to attribute the methane increase to either human activities like cattle breeding and landfills or natural sources such as wetlands. They believe that the rising emissions come from the tropical and mid-latitude northern hemisphere and not from the Arctic, where methane from the melting of permafrost and hydrates has long been a concern. Emissions of nitrous oxide have also grown, with the atmospheric concentration in 2012 at 325.1 parts per billion, 120% above pre-industrial levels. Nitrous oxide gas, although its concentrations are tiny compared to CO2, is 298 times more warming and also plays a role in the destruction of the ozone layer. Recent research indicates that the rate of increase in emissions might be slowing down, but the gases can continue to concentrate in the atmosphere and exert a climate influence for hundreds if not thousands of years. Scientists believe that the new data indicates that global warming will be back with a vengeance, after a slowdown in the rate of temperature increases over the past 14 years. "The laws of physics and chemistry are not negotiable," said Michel Jarraud. "Greenhouse gases are what they are, the laws of physics show they can only contribute to warming the system, but parts of this heat may go in different places like the oceans for some periods of time," he said. This view was echoed by Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. "For the past decade or so the oceans have been sucking up this extra heat, meaning that surface temperatures have only increased slowly. "Don't expect this state of affairs to continue though, the extra heat will eventually come out and bite us, so expect strong warming over the coming decades." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Hinkley firm denies fuel claim</title>

      <body>The company building Britain's first nuclear power station in a generation has denied a suggestion that the new plant would use controversial MOX fuel. French state-owned utility EDF said the use of plutonium-based Mixed Oxide fuel was not under consideration for use at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Under questioning by the Public Accounts Committee, Mark Higson from the Office for Nuclear Development, said MOX could be used. Mr Higson was speaking on 4 November. The OND chief executive told the committee that MOX fuel could be used "in power stations yet to be built. The EPR reactor at Hinkley, for example". MOX is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. It often consists of plutonium along with uranium, from either natural, reprocessed or depleted sources. EDF, which wants to use French reactor technology backed by Chinese money at Hinkley, responded quickly to the statement, saying it was not correct and that using MOX was not even a consideration. In a statement, an EDF spokesman said: "We have not used MOX in any of our stations and have no plans to do so in the future in our existing stations or new nuclear stations." Mixed oxide fuel was contrived as a method of getting rid of Britain's stockpile of civil plutonium - the largest in the world - accumulated from years of reprocessing foreign and UK nuclear waste. But there is no active plan to dispose of the material, which is now seen as a terrorism target and a proliferation risk because it can be used to make nuclear bombs. Turning plutonium into MOX fuel was thought to be the answer. But the Sellafied MOX plant built to make it failed dramatically at a cost of £1.4bn and was closed in 2011. A planned new MOX facility has a price tag of between £5bn and £6bn to the taxpayer. But the business case is controversial. To the astonishment of MPs on the committee, Mr Higson explained: "The value of the fuel, we would expect to be less than the cost of operating and building the MOX plant." In other words, it would be done purely to dispose of the plutonium, with no certain market for the fuel. EDF says it won't use MOX and Horizon, the other major nuclear company hoping to build reactors in the UK, which is backed by the Japanese firm Hitachi, said it has no plans to use MOX either. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, commented: "MOX is a nuclear fuel invented by governments to address the embarrassing problem of what to do with separated plutonium. It is expensive, difficult to handle and increases maintenance and storage costs, so utilities will always be very reluctant to use MOX unless forced to do so." A spokesman for Decc said the government's preferred option for dealing with plutonium remained MOX, but it appeared to row back on the statement made to MPs. "Mr Higson's reference to Hinkley was merely by way of example. The EPR is capable of burning MOX fuel. Actual use of MOX in Hinkley or any other new build reactors would need to be subject to commercial negotiations with operators concerned. Such commercial negotiations are naturally some way off as the reactors have yet to be built." The spokesman added that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was also looking at alternative options. Hinkley is already controversial. Peter Atherton of the city firm Liberum Capital called it "the most expensive power station in the world (excluding hydro schemes)". Criticism has focused on the government decision to allow EDF to charge £92.50 per Megawatt-hour (MWh), twice the current market rate for the electricity which, because it is index linked, would be nearer £121 per MWh by the time the plant opens. That could earn the French and Chinese state-owned firms up to £80bn over the life of the plant. A controversy over MOX fuel could be the last thing they need. </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The UK's largest ever coastal flood realignment sees a part of the West Sussex coast given back to the sea to increase protection.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24770379</url>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened. However, they are clearly very happy to be together and they follow each other everywhere." </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <body>By BBC camerawoman Rachel Price I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. Launch Day: We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. One minute to go Correspondent Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth and directing a high-pressure water mixture at the rock to release the gas inside. Chris Faulkner, Chief Executive of Breitling Energy Corporation, told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast : "The reality is if we could just extract just 10% of the resource... it will power this country for the next 50 years."

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. Here Dr Tuffen describes the findings and what it was like to witness the giant volcanic eruption still in action.

Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. Dr John Bradshaw of Bristol University, an expert in anthrozoology, told the BBC's Sarah Montague: "We now know that dogs are reading each others' body language".

      <description>What India's space scientists and street children have in common</description>

      <body>As India launched a mission to Mars this week, I could not help noting some surprising similarities between the ingenuity of the country's space scientists and its street children - many of whom are creative small-scale entrepreneurs. When you see young children darting between lumbering locomotives to snatch up an empty water bottle or raking through the great mountains of reeking refuse for the plastic bags and broken cardboard boxes they gather together to sell for fractions of a penny, there appears to be an unassailable argument that social welfare should be put before any attempt to reach for the stars. But I was to discover that neither the plight of Delhi's street children nor the apparent extravagance of India's otherworldly ambitions were quite what they seemed. The team of Indian scientists designing the delicate instruments made to sniff and probe the Red Planet is based in the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's main city. I had been expecting the kind of shimmering glass monolith you would associate with a Nasa lab or with the headquarters of one of India's world-beating IT companies. But the cradle of the nation's space research harks back to another, older India. There is a hand painted No Spitting sign in English and Hindi at the gate. Inside, the slightly shabby 1970s blocks are shaded by gracious tropical trees full of squabbling parakeets. Yet the scientists who work here confounded the world when India's 2008 lunar probe confirmed the presence of water on the moon - something every previous mission had missed. "We have had to make a virtue of our limitations," says Professor Jitendra Goswami, the director of the institute and the man behind the discovery. He is proud that, at £50m ($80m), India's Mars mission is the cheapest in history by a considerable margin. The payload is tiny, just 14.5kg (32lbs). "Small enough to take on as cabin baggage", he jokes. "Our instruments may cover a very narrow range," he says, serious now. "But they are looking somewhere no-one else had looked - that is how we found water on the moon." He hopes his mission will help answer a key question - has there ever been life on Mars? - by testing for methane over the entire planet's surface. It will also be looking at how the Martian atmosphere has changed. I came away impressed by how India's space programme uses its tiny resources to do innovative and original science. But in some ways what the street children of Delhi do is even more impressive - they find value in something that is regarded as completely worthless by most people, in the city's rubbish. These are some of the poorest people in what is still a very poor country in the world, yet what strikes you when you meet them is not their desperation and despondency - quite the opposite. Many are energetic and creative entrepreneurs. My guide was Iqbal, a former street child who had been taken into care by a charity called the Salaam Baalak Trust. Iqbal was abused as a child and ran away to live rough in Delhi when he was just 10. To my surprise he says life was not that hard. "Food is no problem," Iqbal explains. "Lots of charities give out free food. I would spend the money I earned collecting rubbish playing video games in the backstreet arcades." In fact, one of the biggest challenges for the Salaam Baalak Trust, and charities like it, is persuading the children to give up life on the streets to go and live in their shelters and homes. "They get addicted to this sort of life," Gagan Singh, one of the Salaam Baalak trustees tells me, with a sigh of resignation. "They start enjoying the freedom." Street life may be exciting but it is dangerous. Street children are prey to gangs and paedophiles, many sniff glue and take other drugs. Which is why, Singh tells me, inspiring role models are so important. In one of the Trust's shelters Iqbal points proudly to a poster with photos of half a dozen former street children brought up by the Trust. "Amit has just finished an electronic engineering course, Sonia is doing fashion designing, and," he says, clearly impressed, "Niaz is working at Domino's Pizza as a team leader." In Ahmedabad, Prof Goswami believes the Mars mission should inspire too. He first became fascinated by space after the launch of Sputnik, the world's first satellite, back in 1957. "Night after night I lay stretched out on the lawn in my parent's garden in Assam, looking up into the heavens to try and catch a glimpse of Sputnik passing," he says. He argues that, if the Mars mission is successful, every Indian child, whether in a village in Assam or on the streets of Delhi, can look up into the night sky and, when they catch a glimpse of the red glimmer of Mars, will know their country has been there. He hopes it will raise the ambitions of the entire nation. You can listen to Justin Rowlatt's interview with Professor Jitendra Goswami via BBC iPlayer.

      <body>The 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Russel Wallace, the "forgotten hero" who co-discovered evolution, is being marked today in London. The first ever statue of the naturalist will be unveiled at the Natural History Museum by Sir David Attenborough. A new wasp genus - Wallaceaphytis - has been named in honour of the man who has been in Darwin's shadow ever since they co-published their theory in 1858. The wasp was discovered in Borneo, where Wallace carried out his research. "It seemed only fitting to name it in his honour, especially as it is the centenary of his death," said Dr Andrew Polaszek of the NHM, one of the expedition team who found the insect last year. They have published their discovery in the Journal of Natural History - the same annals in which Wallace published his famous paper on the origin of species - "the Sarawak Law". Just one millimetre long, the wasp belongs to a group known as parasitoids, which lay their eggs inside other insects or spiders. "Wallaceaphytis is so unusual that one of my volunteers called me over to the microscope saying 'this looks really strange'," Dr Polaszek told the BBC. "Not only is it a new species but also a completely new genus. And we found it in Wallace's old stomping ground." The incredible variety of insects Wallace discovered during his travels in the Malay Archipelago inspired his theory of evolution by natural selection. He described his ideas in an essay which he sent to Charles Darwin - who subsequently sought to co-publish his own independent version of the theory. But while there are many, many monuments to Darwin, there has never been a single one of Wallace - until today. A life-size bronze sculpture by Anthony Smith will be unveiled at the NHM by Sir David Attenborough. "For me, there is no more admirable character in the history of science," said Attenborough of Wallace, in a special BBC audio slideshow charting the explorer's life and legacy. The new statue is the result of a fundraising campaign by the Wallace Memorial Fund, which is holding a special day of talks, Consensus, in London on 16 November. It depicts the moment when Wallace first glimpsed the male of the golden birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera croesus), on Bacan Island, Indonesia, in 1859. "The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable," wrote Wallace in his book The Malay Archipelago. "On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. "I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate cause." </body>

That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

      <title>Culling badgers? Call the 'paras'</title>
      <description>Can badger cull extensions do anything to help tackle TB?</description>

      <body>Fresh from leading his very own dessert campaign, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is now doing his bit for "iconic species". And no, I don't mean badgers. Mr Paterson is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that British Army paratroopers will provide training for local wildlife rangers in their fight against poaching. "Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world's most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it," Mr Paterson said ahead of his visit. But perhaps the training and guidance that the paratroopers will be providing, could also be put to good effect back home? As well as details of Mr Paterson's safari to save endangered species, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published his latest written ministerial statement on the badger cull taking place in Gloucestershire and West Somerset. You'll recall that in both pilot areas, the culling companies were forced to apply to Natural England for extra time to meet the 70% target stipulated in their licences. In West Somerset the natural born cullers were authorised to kill an extra 165 badgers in the three weeks of added time. They managed to shoot an extra 90. So instead of the 70% needed to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, the men of the night managed to get to 65%. Perhaps with some of that paratrooper training, they would have hit the target? Or maybe those dastardly poachers could be persuaded to visit West Somerset and Gloucestershire? According to Mr Paterson, the failure to hit the magic number doesn't really matter. For this is but year one of a grand four-year plan. This is not to be confused with those old Soviet five-year plans where the harvests were always abundant, and the workers were always smiling. In his statement, Mr Paterson said the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer "was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled after the initial six-week period would improve the disease control benefits achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. "With the further removal of badgers seen," Mr Paterson went on, "the extension has been successful in meeting this aim." So even if they had shot just one extra badger, would that also improve the disease control benefits? I'm getting a sense that goalposts might once again be in motion. Because just a year ago, when he was explaining to the House of Commons why the badger cull should be postponed, Mr Paterson was at pains to say that getting to this magic number was crucial to the success of the trial. "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the populations," he said at the time. There's an old adage in boxing, that tactical plans go out the window when you get the first punch on the nose. It would appear that Mr Paterson's hooter has been shipping a few blows.

      <body>Colombia's Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday whether to reopen Bogota's famous bullfighting ring. In the lead up to the decision, the issue has been raging on social media. Colombians love social media. Anyone who's anyone in the world of politics, sport or celebrity in Colombia uses Twitter. And bullfighting is one of the hottest issues at the moment, says Camilo Andres Garcia, a journalist, high-profile Twitter user and social media commentator in Bogota, who is opposed to bullfighting. It's the blood when the bull dies that many Colombians find hard to deal with. There has been enough human blood shed during the country's decades-long conflict, he says. Bullfighting is associated with the elite in Colombia - and conjures up images of rich ranch owners and women in hats and fancy dresses. There are many high profile supporters of bullfighters - including a number of Colombian newspapers - but on social media, they appear to be losing the PR battle. There are two rival hashtags doing the rounds on Twitter in Colombia ahead of this court decision, #LasCorridasNOVuelvenABogota - bullfighting won't return to Bogota - and #VuelvenlosTorosaBogota - the bulls are coming back to Bogota. The anti-crowd's voice is far louder though (12,000 tweets on their hashtag, versus fewer than 200 on the pro-side at the time of writing). "It's a very important decision for our family," says Diana Carolina Baquero Hernandez, a journalist and bullfighting radio host. Her family's history is bound up with Bogota's bullfighting ring, Plaza la Santamaria. Her father's uncle was once the manager, and many of her relatives were born and grew up inside the stadium. "Bullfighting is our life, our passion, our tradition," she says. Baquero-Hernandez has set up a Facebook page in support of bullfighting, but it's small-scale, and she admits her side is being drowned out. She says many who criticise bullfighting are ill-informed. "I feel angry sometimes because I feel people don't understand the real meaning of bullfighting. Bullfighting is an art." Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <title>How the Mars mission helps India</title>
      <description>What a mission to Mars means for India</description>

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

He calls the principle Note by Note cuisine and says it is like a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing note by note. The result is food not as we know it, more like being given a chemistry set on your plate.

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <title>Apple and Samsung back in court</title>
      <description>Apple and Samsung are heading back to court in a row over damages awarded in a patent action.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24855829</url>

      <body>Apple and Samsung are returning to court in one of the most high-profile patent battles of recent times. In August 2012, a jury found Samsung guilty of infringing six Apple patents and awarded one of the largest payouts of its kind on record. The verdict and $1bn (£626m) awarded in damages were seen as a massive victory for Apple. This is just one of many patent cases the two companies are fighting in courtrooms across the world. In March 2013, a judge re-examined the $1bn awarded to Apple and reduced the amount saying the damages would need to be assessed at a new trial. Judge Lucy Koh said the original jury in the court in California had incorrectly calculated part of the damages. The judge said that $550m of the award had been worked out in the proper manner but she ordered that the remaining $450m be reassessed. That $450m could be increased or lowered meaning that Apple could conceivably end up with more than the original $1bn awarded at the first trial. Apple had originally sought $2.5bn in damages from Samsung. It argued that the South Korean company had copied its designs for the bodies of the original iPhone and iPad as well as user-interface elements such as the bounce-back response when a person scrolls beyond the end of list and tap-to-zoom. Samsung argued it was already working on rounded rectangular handsets dominated by a screen and a single button months before the iPhone was revealed. It sought $519m in damages from Apple. At the time of the original ruling Samsung said the decision was bad news for consumers and would "lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices". Apple said it applauded the court "for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud clear message that stealing isn't right". Even after this latest trial, which will involve a new jury, both companies could appeal. "I think they will appeal unless they settle," intellectual property consultant Florian Mueller told the BBC. "But at this point neither party has enough leverage to force someone into settling if they don't want to. And we're not there yet," he said. Apple has asked for a sales ban to be imposed on the Samsung products that had been found to infringe the patents. But the judge ruled that Apple could adequately be compensated financially. "Between these types of big players a $1bn damages award is not as bad as a sales ban," said Mr Mueller. Apple appealed against that ruling and the result of the appeal is due before the end of the year. Samsung and Apple are currently locked in a battle in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe. But some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told the BBC recently that: "There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further. "I do kind of wish they were more compatible." In October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court in Europe over alleged infringements of certain types of patents for a period of five years. The European Union authorities had said the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faced a potential £11.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws. </body>

      <body>An electrical current capable of charging a mobile phone has been created from microwave signals. A team from Duke University said the technology they had used had been as efficient as using solar panels. The device they created used metamaterials, which capture various forms of wave energy and convert them for other applications. In the future, satellite, sound or wi-fi signals could be "harvested", according to the US researchers. "We're showing... these materials can be useful for consumer applications," said engineering student Alexander Katko. Using fibreglass and copper conductors on a circuit board, the researchers converted microwaves into 7.3 volts of electricity. A USB charger, which is often used to recharge mobile phone batteries and cameras, provides about five volts. "We were aiming for the highest energy efficiency we could achieve," said team member Allen Hawkes. "We had been getting energy efficiency around 6-10%, but with this design we were able to dramatically improve energy conversion to 37%, which is comparable to what is achieved in solar cells." Metamaterials are artificial materials that display properties not usually found in nature. In future, the two students and their colleague Steven Cummer hope that the technology can be built in to mobile phones. This would allow the handsets to recharge wirelessly when not being used. They also believe that it could help users living in remote areas without access to the power grid. They would be able to "harvest" the energy from signals generated by mobile phone towers. "Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting," said Mr Cummer. "The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power." The full report will be published in the journal Applied Physics Letters in December. </body>

      <title>Smartphone camera reveals PIN</title>
      <description>Cambridge University researchers warn that your PIN can be revealed by watching your face through your smartphone camera and listening for clicks through the microphone.</description>

      <body>The PIN for a smartphone can be revealed by its camera and microphone, researchers have warned. Using a programme called PIN Skimmer a team from the University of Cambridge found that codes entered on a number-only soft keypad could be identified. The software watches your face via the camera and listens to clicks through the microphone as you type. The tests were carried out on the Google Nexus-S and the Galaxy S3 smartphones. "We demonstrated that the camera, usually used for conferencing or face recognition, can be used maliciously," say the report's authors Prof Ross Anderson and Laurent Simon. According to the research, the microphone is used to detect "touch-events" as a user enters their PIN. In effect, it can "hear" the clicks that the phone makes as a user presses the virtual number keys. The camera then estimates the orientation of the phone as the user is doing this and "correlates it to the position of the digit tapped by the user". "We watch how your face appears to move as you jiggle your phone by typing," said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University. "It did surprise us how well it worked," he told the BBC. When trying to work out four-digit PINs the programme was successful more than 50% of the time after five attempts. With eight-digit PINs the success rate was 60% after 10 attempts. Many smartphone users have a pincode to lock their phone but they are increasingly used to access other types of applications on a smartphone, including banking apps. This raises the question of which resources should remain accessible on a phone when someone is entering a sensitive PIN, say the report's authors. "For instance when a call comes in, the user needs to hear the ring tone while unlocking his phone; otherwise he may assume the caller has hung up." One suggestion to prevent a PIN being identified is to use a longer number but the researchers warn this affects "memorability and usability". "Randomising" the position of numbers on the keypad is also suggested but the researchers believe this would "cripple usability on phones". Getting rid of passwords altogether and using fingerprints or face recognition are offered as more drastic solutions. "If you're developing payment apps, you'd better be aware that these risks exist," warns Prof Anderson. </body>

      <title>Warcraft world gets fifth expansion</title>
      <description>The fifth expansion for World of Warcraft will see players delve into the history of the long-running online game.</description>

      <body>Blizzard has announced the fifth expansion for its flagship World of Warcraft (WoW) online game. Called the Warlords of Draenor it adds a new world to the game, lets players build settlements and instantly boost a character to high level. The announcement comes as WoW player numbers hit a five-year low and Blizzard starts to group players on a smaller number of servers. Blizzard has also unveiled plans for a new game called Heroes of the Storm. Details about Warlords of Draenor were unveiled at the annual Blizzcon gaming convention. The expansion involves a time-travelling storyline that will see players re-enact some of the events from the series of Warcraft strategy games that predated WoW. The expansion is set on the world of Draenor and gives players a series of new zones, dungeons and instances to play on. Warlords lets characters play at level 100, introduces player settlements called garrisons and updates the look of some of the game's different races. Blizzard said buyers of Warlords would be able to boost one character to level 90 so they could instantly go adventuring in the world of the expansion. No release date for Warlords has yet been given. The news comes soon after Blizzard revealed that subscriber numbers for WoW had dropped to about 7.7 million. The last time they were this low was in 2007 and they are significantly down on the 2010 high of 12 million. To manage this decline, Blizzard has introduced a system that lets people play across servers to ensure the game's economy, Player-versus-Player areas and arena battle systems have enough people participating to keep them functioning. Writing on the Rock Paper Shotgun game news site, Nathan Grayson described Warlords of Draenor as a "decent expansion" but said the decision to re-visit Warcraft's past was "puzzling". "This is maintenance, in a sense," he wrote. "Something to keep existing players interested and happy. And who knows? Maybe the focus that a smaller audience allows will be good for WoW in the long run." Blizzcon also saw the announcement of a new game called Heroes of the Storm. This is an arena-based hero brawling game that lets people take control of key characters from almost every game Blizzard makes including Starcraft and Diablo. The heroes are united in teams and fight rivals for dominance on one of a series of different maps. A beta test of Heroes is currently under way and Blizzard said the finished game would be released "soonish". </body>

      <body>Pegatron Corporation, the Taiwanese company that assembles Apple's iPhone 5C, has reported lower-than-expected profits. Analysts have said that Pegatron is experiencing slower orders for the 5C, which is Apple's cheaper smartphone. Net profits were T$2.48bn ($84m; £53m) for its third quarter, slightly below analyst forecasts, but higher than the T$1.35bn it made last year. Pegatron also makes laptops for Lenovo and former parent Asustek Computer. The company's share price hit an all-time high in May on reports that it was winning orders away from rival Hon Hai Precision Industry, another established Apple supplier. But in a recent research note Nomura said it was downgrading the stock from "buy" to "neutral" blaming "deteriorating orders for 5C and risks of new EMS [Electronics Manufacturing Services] makers taking market share". The bank added that it saw "a lack of positive catalysts in the near term". And last week the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was considering adding another Taiwan-based manufacturer, Wistron, to its roster of iPhone 5C makers, potentially increasing competition for Pegatron and reducing profit margins. In October, Apple reported falling fourth quarter profits of $7.5bn (£4.6bn), despite iPhone sales rising 26% to 33.8 million. These were the first earnings to include sales of Apple's new iPhone models: the iPhone 5s and the cheaper iPhone 5C, which is designed to appeal to the Chinese market. However Apple does not break out sales figures for the iPhone 5C. Over the summer Pegatron was criticised by human rights group China Labor Watch, which accused the company of workplace violations in three of its factories. The group said it found evidence of "at least 86 labour rights violations, including 36 legal violations and 50 ethical violations" following an undercover investigation. Apple is known to be diversifying its list of suppliers and looking increasingly to Chinese manufacturers. </body>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A man who ran an online "wallet service" for storing Bitcoins has claimed hackers stole virtual currency from his site worth more than one million Australian dollars. The Australian man said 4,100 Bitcoins (US$1.04m, £650,000) were taken in two separate attacks. He said he would not report the theft to police as Bitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to trace. This has led some users to speculate whether it was an "inside job". In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved. The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website. "I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this has happened is an understatement. "Please don't store Bitcoins on an internet-connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's." Bitcoin is the most well known of a handful of virtual currencies. The currencies are developed through a computer process called "mining" and can be traded on exchanges or privately between users. </body>

      <title>'Lover Spy' hacker FBI 'most wanted'</title>

      <body>A man who allegedly created malware purporting to catch out cheating lovers has made it on to the FBI's "most wanted" list of cybercriminals. The FBI says Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara ran a website offering customers a way to "catch a cheating lover" by sending spyware masquerading as a greeting card. Opening the card downloaded the malware on to the recipient's computer and recorded keystrokes and messages. The "Lover Spy" program cost $89 (£55). Mr Perez-Melara was indicted in July 2005 but has avoided capture ever since, only now making it on to the FBI's most wanted list. He ran the operation from his San Diego home in 2003, the FBI says, while he was in the US on a student travel visa. The charges against Mr Perez-Melara, 33, included making, sending and advertising an interception device, and unlawfully intercepting electronic communications. The indictment said Lover Spy was designed "with stealth in mind, claiming that it would be impossible to detect by 99.9% of users". But Mr Perez-Melara has avoided the authorities ever since and his last known location was San Salvador, the FBI said. The agency appears to have added the hacker to its list partly out of frustration at his elusiveness. "These are sophisticated folks who know how to hide themselves on the internet,'' said John Brown, who oversees the FBI's cyber-division. The agency has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. According to the 2005 indictment, Mr Perez-Melara sold the malware to 1,000 customers, who then used it to infect the computers of about 2,000 victims. Victims took the bait about half the time, the government said. People who bought the spyware were charged with illegally intercepting electronic communications. </body>

      <body>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's official website has been hacked by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The attack comes a day after Mr Lee said he would track down the group. He made the comments after a person claiming to be part of the group posted an online video in which he threatened to hack government websites. Singapore's internet and phone regulator said part of the website had been "compromised" late on Thursday. "The PMO main website is still working, and we are working to restore the page that has been compromised," the Infocomm Development Authority said in a statement. The hackers had posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the PM's website with the words: "It's great to be Singaporean today." Under new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites "that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers" require individual licences. The video, which was posted last month, had protested against the government's new rules for news websites. Earlier this week, Mr Lee said his government would "spare no effort to try and track down the culprits". "If we can find him, we will bring him to justice and he will be dealt with severely. You may think you're anonymous but we will make that extra effort to find out who you are," he added. Earlier this month, a hacker - dubbed The Messiah and claiming to be a part of Anonymous - hacked the website of Singapore's main paper, The Straits Times. He had left a message saying the paper's report on the video was misleading. According to reports, The Messiah also claimed responsibility for hacking the website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council last week, the municipal branch of the prime minister's district. Hackers linked to Anonymous have defaced dozens of websites belonging to Australian businesses and Philippine government agencies during the past week. </body>

      <title>Instagram grapples with drug adverts</title>
      <description>Facebook blocks searches for some topics associated with photos used to publicise the illegal sale of drugs via Instagram but leaves others active.</description>

      <body>Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. The photo-themed social network took the measure after being asked to respond to an investigation by #BBCtrending - a new social media series. The journalists had uncovered many pictures and videos of narcotics posted alongside text advertising their sale. Instagram is owned by Facebook. The firm has a policy of acting on posts reported as being inappropriate, but it believes it would be impractical and invasive to search for such material. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." Among Instagram's "report photo/video" choices is the option to identify suspected drug use. The BBC understands Facebook's staff aim to review posts flagged to either of its social networks within 48 hours. They also have the option of blocking terms classed as "bad hashtags" - ones that promote banned activities - if they are mentioned in the press or in user reports. The only content Facebook does actively search for is images of child abuse. Most of the drugs-related activity appears to be taking place in the US. "Just getting a few packs ready for tomorrow morning... Place your order today, it gets shipped out at 8AM tomorrow," read one post placed beneath an image of bags of marijuana. Another picture showed a variety of pills, adding: "$2 a pop for xans, $10 a pop for roxys." This refers to Xanax, a psychoactive anxiety treatment, and Roxicodone, an opiate used to treat pain. Both require prescriptions in the US and the UK, but are sometimes bought on the black market. Crystals of MDMA and other amphetamine-related substances were among other drugs advertised via photos and videos. In many cases the buyer and seller arranged to finalise their deals using WhatsApp or Kik - instant messaging apps in which they could keep messages private. Like Instagram, accounts can be set up on these services without revealing either party's true identity. Instagram is not the only social network on which drugs are advertised. The BBC has also seen instances of the practice in comments below some videos on Google's YouTube service. But while it is relatively common for the person who uploaded a drug-themed photo or video on Instagram to be the one advertising the sale of the substance, on YouTube the person posting the ad tends to do so below videos belonging to others. Like Facebook, Google relies on users reporting a problem before taking action. "We take user safety seriously and have guidelines that prohibit any content encouraging dangerous, illegal activities," said a spokeswoman for YouTube. "This includes content promoting the sale of drugs. YouTube's review teams respond to videos flagged for our attention around the clock, removing millions of videos each year that violate our policies." One drugs abuse researcher - who has advised the UN, World Health Organization and the UK government - said he was concerned by what he had seen. "I'm not particularly sophisticated on the internet, and it took me 10 seconds to see posts selling class-A drugs on Instagram," said Prof Neil McKeganey, founder of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research, in Glasgow. "Here is a public space being used to trade some of the most dangerous substances that we know are being abused. "I absolutely feel there is a responsibility to take proactive action. "It seems to me far too serious for those who own the companies that provide the public space through which this is occurring to simply say it's up to contributors to bring this to their attention." UK-based drugs treatment charity Addaction said it too wanted social media companies to act "swiftly and vigilantly", adding that it believed the companies could make a positive difference if they did. "Social media is a great way of reaching out to millions and millions of people," said spokesman Elliot Elam. "That's why we'd like to see providers of these sites work with organisations like ours, so they can find ways to engage with any users who may be struggling with drug or alcohol problems." Google and Facebook are not the only companies that rely on user reports to indentify potential drugs deals. Yahoo's blogging service Tumblr confirmed it had the same policy. "For legal reasons, we do not proactively monitor the site," said a spokeswoman. "We respond to reports of activity that is illegal or against our policies pursuant to those policies and relevant law." Although the BBC found photos of illegal drugs on Tumblr, searches for the terms that brought up associated adverts on Instagram did not appear to do so on Yahoo's service. This is not the first time Instagram's self-policing policies have been called into question. In August the Fusion.net blog suggested that the illegal psychedelics 2C-I and 2CB were also being advertised via the app. Vice Magazine also highlighted that marijuana and several kinds of prescription pills were promoted on the service. However it suggested that banning related hashtags would not solve the problem, saying "users would get more creative and choose other labels". More recently US senator Edward Markey wrote to the service's chief executive, Kevin Systrom, asking him to look into reports that unregulated gun sales were being conducted through the app. "Other companies that enable online sales have enacted commonsense protocols," he wrote. "I encourage Instagram to take similar steps and adopt safe business practices that curb the marketing and sale of guns." #BBCtrending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <body>Electric carmaker Tesla's Model S has suffered its third fire in five weeks. In the latest incident, which took place on Wednesday in the US state of Tennessee, a fire broke out in a car after it hit debris on the road. Tesla said the fire did not start spontaneously but was the result of the accident. The previous two fires have also been related to accidents. The firm's shares fell more than 7% on Thursday, after a 14% fall on Wednesday triggered by weak earnings. The company reported that it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. In the latest incident, the front of a Tesla vehicle burst into flames after it ran over a tow bar near the town of Smyrna, Tennessee. Analysts said that while the fires had been the result of accidents, investors had been worried about any potential impact on the firm. "For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging," said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, added that the risk of a formal investigation by US safety regulators "could raise near-term concerns to a higher level in terms of cost, image and production disruption". Tesla's shares fell 7.5% to close at $139.7 on Thursday. In October, a Model S caught fire after the driver ran over what Tesla said was "an extremely large object" near Seattle, Washington state. After the fire, officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had said they found no evidence to indicate that it resulted from defects or violations of US safety standards. The second incident took place in Mexico later in the month. According to reports a car caught fire after it drove through a roundabout, crashed through a concrete wall and hit a tree. Tesla said it is investigating the latest incident in Tennessee to find out what had caused the fire. "Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident," Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean said in a statement. "We will provide more information when we're able to do so." The firm's chief executive, Elon Musk, has previously said that electric cars are safer than conventional cars. </body>

      <title>Vodafone fails on 3G mobile coverage</title>
      <description>Ofcom names Vodafone as only operator that has failed to reach 90% of the population with its 3G mobile services.</description>

      <body>Mobile firm Vodafone has been rapped by regulator Ofcom for failure to meet its coverage obligations. When 3G mobile spectrum licences were awarded in 2000, they included an obligation to roll services out to 80% of the population. In 2010 this was increased to 90%. EE, Three and O2 are deemed to have successfully met this obligation. But Vodafone falls short by 1.4%. It has promised to rectify this by the end of 2013. It will involve rolling out 3G to more mobile masts than it had originally intended. "Ofcom is fully aware of our plans to ensure compliance by the end of this year," the firm said in a statement. "Our network investment stands at more than £900m this year alone and we remain on track to deliver indoor coverage across 2G, 3G and 4G to 98% of the population by 2015, two years ahead of the regulator's deadline," it added. Ofcom will monitor its progress and reassess its 3G coverage in January 2014. Mobile coverage is a huge bugbear for consumers and one that Ofcom is determined to prioritise. Recently it produced a report suggesting that mobile coverage on Britain's roads was poor. Next year it will report on the mobile coverage on the country's railways. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum thinks that it will be little hardship for Vodafone to comply. "I don't see it being very much of an issue for them to catch up and quite probably it will happen before the end of the year," Customers can take heart from the current 4G rollouts, he said. "4G coverage will be better and much more likely to be complied with given the spectrum at 800MHz travels further distances and penetrates buildings well." </body>

      <body>A US company has unveiled build-your-own toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them. The modular system, called Moss, uses magnetic balls as joints and hinges, has no external wires, and works without the user having to write any computer code. By attaching a Bluetooth module, players can control the robots remotely using a smartphone or tablet. The system has been developed by Modular Robotics in Boulder, Colorado. The company launched the toys on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. But chief executive and design director Eric Schweikardt told the BBC: "We're already making Moss so we don't need the Kickstarter funding. But in 2013, it seems like the place where people look for cool new tech products." The final version of the robot kits would "begin shipping in January or February", he said. "We're at the very beginning of an exciting time for consumer robotics." Hod Lipson, professor of engineering at Cornell University, New York State, said: "Modular robotics have been around for decades, and we've always believed they could be cheap, robust and versatile. In practice, they've proved to be expensive and fragile. "Modular Robotics is one of the first companies putting in the effort to mass-produce these things." He believes such toys could help make robotics accessible to young children and interest them in engineering from a young age. Although he used to teach Mr Schweikardt, Prof Lipson stressed that he had no financial interest in the company. In October, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed off cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and stick together using magnets. </body>

      <title>Dyson Award for wearable robotic arm</title>

      <body>A battery-powered robotic arm that boosts human strength has won the 2013 James Dyson award. The Titan Arm, designed by four mechanical engineering students from the University of Pennsylvania, could help people with back injuries rebuild and regain control of muscles. It can also be used by people to lift heavy objects as part of their work. The team, who spent eight months creating the exoskeleton, will share a prize of £30,000 ($48,000). "Titan Arm is obviously an ingenious design, but the team's use of modern, rapid - and relatively inexpensive - manufacturing techniques makes the project even more compelling," said Sir James Dyson. "We are ecstatic," team member Nick Parrotta told the BBC. "It was totally unexpected - just incredible." The team produced its prototype for £1,200, which they say is a 50th of the typical cost of similar exoskeletons currently on the market. "We wanted Titan Arm to be affordable, as exoskeletons are rarely covered by health insurance," said Mr Parrotta, 23, currently studying for a masters in mechanical engineering. "This informed our design decisions and the materials we used. Most structural components are machined from inexpensive aluminium." Academic and commercial interest in wearable robotics is growing according to Conor Walsh, Professor of of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. But costs will have to continue falling if robotics are to feature more often in daily life, he said. "Reducing cost will be critical for commercial systems, however the total cost is not just the cost of the hardware but also the added cost associated with research and development, quality assurance and regulatory compliance." The Titan arm incorporates a rigid back brace to maintain posture, a shoulder featuring rotational joints, and sensors that can track motion and relay data back to doctors for remote prognosis. It can augment human weight-lifting strength by 40lbs (18kg), say the inventors, while the batteries can last for up to eight hours, depending on intensity of usage and workload. The current prototype is operated by a separate joystick, but future versions may incorporate electromyography technology, said Mr Parrotta, which picks up electrical signals produced by muscle tissue, thus allowing users to operate such prosthetics almost without thinking. All of the inventors who took part in the competition used 3D-printing to develop and produce their prototypes much more cheaply than would have been possible before. "Prototyping technology, previously reserved only for companies with big research and development budgets, is enabling young inventors to develop sophisticated concepts at university," said Sir James. "They can revitalise industries on a small budget - it is a good time to be an inventor." The two runners up were Handie, a prosthetic hand with sensors that can read brain signals, and Cortex, a 3D-printed plastic cast for broken limbs. The James Dyson Foundation runs the annual award across 18 countries with the aim of encouraging problem-solving inventions. </body>

      <title>Twitter shares jump on market debut</title>
      <description>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter close at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26, after the firm's first day as public company.</description>

      <body>Shares in the microblogging site Twitter closed at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26 each. That means after its first day as a public company, Twitter is now valued at a little over $31bn (£19bn). More than 13 million shares were traded once they became available an hour after the New York Stock Exchange opened. It is the biggest technology listing since Facebook in 2012. Twitter floated on the NYSE and not, as some initially expected, the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange, where the likes of Facebook are listed. It was a big win for the NYSE, which decorated its exterior with banners promoting the offering on Thursday. Twitter has more than 230 million users, but is yet to make a profit. Shares in newly listed companies are often volatile on their first day of trading. Within minutes, Twitter's stock price soared more than 80% before closing just below its initial opening price of $45.10 per share. When Facebook launched on the Nasdaq, its shares were priced initially at $38 each. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45. But its price later slumped. It only recovered those losses by 11 September 2013, when shares again touched $45. Its initial public offering (IPO) was also marred by technological glitches and delays. To prevent Twitter's stock sale from having a similar fate, the NYSE ran tests on 26 October using larger-than-normal share volumes. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise more than $1.82bn. The company, which invites users to send tweets in 140 characters or less, has 232 million active users. According to its IPO documents, these users send 500 million tweets a day. Twitter's financials have been under greater scrutiny since it announced its plan to float, especially given that the company is still loss-making. It lost $69m in the first six months of 2013 on revenues of $254m. About 85% of revenues come from advertising on its site, and more than 75% of Twitter users access the site from their mobile phone. Mary Jo White, head of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently warned investors to be cautious of the metrics used by technology companies such as Twitter, noting that investors have become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of data. "In the absence of a clear description, it can be hard not to think that these big numbers will inevitably translate into big profits for the company," she said in a speech. "But the connection may not necessarily be there." Twitter's founders saw their paper wealth soar to $4bn in the wake of the stock surge early this morning, although boss Dick Costolo said that none of the founders would immediately be selling their shares. The company's co-founder Evan Williams has a 10% stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. That stake is now worth a little over $2bn. Jack Dorsey, another co-founder, also stands to make a fortune from the IPO. His 4% stake is worth more than $1bn. Another co-founder, Biz Stone, is thought to have made millions of dollars by selling share stakes over the past few years. Big fortunes aside, after the hoopla of the morning it was very quickly was back to work: Twitter employee Melissa Daimler posted a photo of employees at their desks just hours after the NYSE bell was rung. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks with the Spanish football club Real Madrid to acquire naming rights to its Bernabeu Stadium. The 85,454-seat venue is currently named after its former president Santiago Bernabeu. Speaking on Spanish television, the president of Microsoft in Spain said discussions were at an early stage. "They've raised... renaming the stadium and we're only talking about this possibility," said Maria Garana. Online reaction to the news included possible new names for the stadium. "At most the stadium will be called the Microsoft Estadio Santiago Bernabeu," said one forum member. "The Gates Ground?" was a suggestion on Twitter by @HuffPostUK, in a nod to the company's founder, Bill Gates. Others wondered whether Microsoft would use the opportunity to promote its products. "Will it be called the Surface and feature players like Cristiano RonalDOS?" tweeted @tomwarren from technology news website The Verge. The Surface is Microsoft's tablet computer and DOS was one of the company's former computer operating systems. The announcement was not well received by all fans of the club. "I'm a Real Madrid fan, I hate Microsoft forever if they touch anything related to Madrid," said Haidi Farnoud. If Microsoft are successful in obtaining the naming rights, they will join a group of several other companies whose names are linked to stadiums. In the English Premier League, the airline Emirates has a tie-in with Arsenal, while Etihad sponsors Manchester City's ground. The German club Bayern Munich play their home matches in the Allianz Arena after signing a 30-year deal with the financial services company. But not all stadium renaming deals have been successful. When Newcastle United changed the name of their ground from St James' Park to the Sports Direct Arena in November 2011, the local council refused to use the new name on official street signs. At the time, the council said the decision to change the name would "upset the overwhelming majority of fans". </body>

      <title>Concept car ditches steering wheel</title>
      <description>Toyota previews a concept car that lacks a steering wheel, instead suggesting drivers would control it by shifting their body weight.</description>

      <body>Toyota has suggested motorists of the future could ride about in a vehicle inspired by a horse. It has announced a concept car that drivers would control by shifting their body weight while standing, doing away with the need for a steering wheel. One analyst said the current design posed too many safety issues, but did point towards future developments. The FV2 vehicle will make its official debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in two weeks' time. Toyota suggested leaning forwards, backwards or to the side to determine the FV2's direction would be "intuitive", adding that voice and facial recognition sensors would bring up information to assist users in their journeys. Suggested destinations and other data would be shown on an augmented reality display presented on the windscreen, it said. The aim was to develop aspects of trust and understanding between the vehicle and the rider "similar to those a rider will have with a horse". "This is an imagination piece rather than something that will be seen in production in the next few years," a spokesman told the BBC. "But some of the technologies we're suggesting could be introduced further down the line - say in five to 10 years' time." Carmakers often release images and models of imagined futuristic vehicles to coincide with motor shows. Although they are sometimes little more than a publicity stunt, they can be valuable as a way of seeking early feedback and helping determine where research and development funds should be invested. It can still take a long time for successful ideas to come to fruition. For example, Toyota first showed off the idea of making a hybrid - combining both an internal combustion engine and an electrical propulsion system - in 1977 when it unveiled a special version of its Sports 800 GT at the Tokyo show. It was 20 years later that it released its first hybrid for sale to the public - the Prius - in Japan. Other examples of tech first seen in concept vehicles include panoramic glass roofs, now found in some Renault and Mercedes cars among others, and using touchscreen panels to do away with dashboard buttons, as is the case in Tesla's Model S. One expert said the Toyota's latest design was intended to address a problem worrying the industry at large. "Lots of carmakers are very frightened by the fact many young people can't afford a car and insurance, and the whole concept of a traditional motor vehicle doesn't really appeal to them," said Paul Newton from the consultants IHS Automotive. "I think in practical terms the FV2 won't see the light of day - if you are standing up and leaning to move it, my first thought would be, what if you hit something? The likelihood of it being licensed in today's safety-conscious environment is zero. "But concepts are the proving ground for lots of technologies that do come into mainstream production, and many things will happen in the next 25 years that will redefine what we've probably spent a good part of century looking at as the norm." Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Honda are among the other firms who have announced they will be unveiling concept vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show, which runs from 22 November to 1 December. </body>

      <title>Call of Duty faces frame-rate issues</title>
      <description>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game report problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title.</description>

      <body>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game have reported problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title. Testers said that its frame rate dropped at several points during the game causing a stutter-effect. The PS4 version of CoD: Ghosts is the only console edition that renders its images in 1080p high definition. The Xbox One and Wii U versions create less processor-intensive 720p resolutions. Publisher Activision has not commented. Although the PS4 version of the game is already on sale, Sony's console itself will not be released until 15 November in North America and 29 November in Europe. That potentially gives Activision time to release a software patch if the issue can be fixed. Ghosts is the 10th first-person shooter game in the main CoD series. Its predecessor, Black Ops II, earned $1bn (£621m) in its first 15 days of release, making it the second fastest-selling game of all time after Grand Theft Auto 5. Earlier this week, the head of Activision's Infinity Ward studio - which developed the newest title - told the BBC that his team had made delivering smooth animations a priority. "One of the key pillars of Call of Duty has been 60 frames per second... and ensuring that was of utmost importance, and the resolutions that appear are geared around that," said Mark Rubin. Elsewhere he suggested that the different way the new consoles handled memory had contributed to a decision to support 1080p graphics on Sony's machine but not Microsoft's. However, some reviews have suggested the PS4 version does not maintain a consistent frame rate as desired. "The PlayStation 4 version... has noticeable technical issues, sometimes slowing to a crawl, particularly during set-piece moments with multiple effects," reported Joystiq. "Frame rate hitches happen throughout the campaign on PlayStation 4 and, in a series known for its Hollywood-inspired bombast, it detracted from the experience." Now Gamer added that it was particularly concerned about the issue occurring during the title's online multiplayer mode. "It's rare - it only happened once every few matches - but it is definitely present," it said. "It's not something we've seen in any Call of Duty multiplayer before, so it stood out as particularly odd and unfortunate, given the frame-rate stutter is significant enough to let targets escape to safety or see you killed during the general mayhem." The blog Gearnuke has gathered together other complaints of a similar nature. Although Activision has yet to provide a statement, Mr Rubin had previously acknowledged: "There's enormous amounts of work ahead of us in perfecting our game engines on both [Sony and Microsoft's] platforms." Sony has not commented on the subject. However, Microsoft has addressed the fact the Xbox One version of Ghosts renders graphics in half the resolution of the PS4, despite the fact both consoles support the 1080p format. "Once people have the chance to play the games and experience Xbox One for themselves, we believe they'll realise that great-looking visuals are only part of the experience," said a spokesman. "Launch is the first of many steps into the new console generation, and we fully expect our developers to continue to break new ground and surpass previous limitations in the years ahead." Reviews of the Xbox One version of Ghosts remain under embargo until 12 November. </body>

      <title>Brazil at odds over anti-NSA net law</title>
      <description>New internet law causes controversy following NSA leaks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24899396</url>
      <date>1384214853</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71055000/jpg/_71055251_apinted.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Along with Russia, China and Iran, Brazil was one of the countries of most interest for US intelligence agencies, according to the leaks from the US National Security Agency (NSA). But whereas those other countries may not have appeared too surprised by the extent of US spying, Brazil was outraged. Documents leaked by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, indicated that the agency had monitored internal Brazilian government communications, had spied on the state oil company, and had even intercepted data from President Dilma Rousseff's own office. In response, Ms Rousseff cancelled a trip to Washington. In an angry speech at the United Nations General Assembly, she accused the US of breaking international law. "Friendly governments and societies that seek to build a true strategic partnership, as in our case, cannot allow recurring illegal actions to take place as if they were normal," she exclaimed. "They are unacceptable." Together with Germany, Brazil also put forward a resolution calling for an end to excessive electronic surveillance. Customers at the Cyber Gol internet café in Catete, a commercial district near the centre of Rio de Janeiro, overwhelmingly agree with President Rousseff's response. "It's a scandal," Paula Fladel, a 42-year old businesswoman, tells the BBC. "I was outraged at the arrogant, overbearing meddling that the US carries out in practically the whole of the world." Joanne Lima, a 22-year old student, says the US has taken advantage of its technological expertise. "They want to play the part of the world's policeman. Not only in Brazil, but in other countries too," she says. "The Brazilian government must take stronger measures to protect our privacy." In fact, Brazil is considering further action. At the end of October, President Rousseff granted what is termed "constitutional urgency" to new legislation on internet usage. After two years crawling through congress, the Marco Civil da Internet - a civil rights framework for internet users and providers - must now be debated ahead of all other parliamentary business. The bill includes measures to protect users' privacy and right to free speech and would prohibit internet service providers (ISPs) from discriminating between different types of content. But in the rush to respond to her citizens' anger over US data intercepts, the president has insisted on an amendment which critics argue could lead to Brazil ending up with a substandard version of the net. President Rousseff wants all internet companies operating in Brazil to store copies of personal information on their Brazilian clients in the country. By doing so, the firms providing cloud services would become subject to local privacy laws. But the most prominent supporters of the original version of the bill think that not only will the amendment fail to secure individual's data, it will also drive up the costs for companies operating in Brazil, and impede local innovation. Rodrigo Lemos is the director of the Institute of Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro and one of the architects of the Marco Civil. "This forced local data storage will make internet companies flee from Brazil," he says. "Brazilian internet users will have a second class service compared to Americans or Europeans. "Websites offering services to Brazilians will have to worry about building a data centre in Brazil." Data storage in Brazilian is costly in comparison to both neighbouring countries and the US. Figures from 2012 indicate Brazil has more than 86 million internet users. Social networks are hugely popular in a country where telephone services are still expensive and patchy. The Latin American giant is second only to the US in terms of individual Facebook users. On making a new acquaintance, Brazilians are more likely to invite each other to continue the relationship on "Face" than they are to ask for a phone number. Brazil also boasts the world's second-largest number of Twitter users. With the social media market in the US and Europe close to saturation point, China's internet users limited in their freedoms, and India's digital revolution still in its infancy, Brazil is set to play an increasingly important role in shaping the global rules governing social media users' data. Critics worry that President Rousseff's proposed legislation could set a precedent that other countries, with less regard for freedom of speech, might follow. But Glenn Greenwald, the Brazil-based journalist who reported Edward Snowden's leaked material, says this is a natural reaction to the anger the NSA's activities have provoked. "I think a lot of countries are going to start to look for ways in which they don't have to be dependent on US infrastructure," says the writer who previously reported for the Guardian newspaper. "One of the ways that the NSA currently intercepts people's data is by physically invading their telecommunications systems through using American companies that have access to their systems. "The more means that are cut off for the NSA to be intercepting this data, I think the more secure these systems will become." Given the widespread opposition to the proposal, it is not clear whether it will survive the final draft of the bill, due to be voted on this week. But the government has indicated that if its idea of local data storage does not form part of the Marco Civil, it will seek to draft separate legislation enshrining the proposal in law at a later date. </body>

      <description>How biometrics make your voice the best weapon against fraud</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24898367</url>

      <body>Big business wants your voice - not for customer feedback, but to tackle fraud. Voice biometrics - the recording and analysis of unique voiceprints for authentication purposes - is one of the latest technological weapons being deployed in the war against fraudsters, thought to be pilfering at least £52bn from the UK economy each year, according to the National Fraud Authority (NFA). UK financial services companies alone are conservatively estimated to be losing more than £5bn annually, the NFA says. But the real figures are likely to be two or three times higher than this as so much fraud goes unreported. Identity theft and account takeover are a big and growing problem, particularly in a digital era that has been a boon to fraudsters by presenting them with many more ways to harvest personal data. The main advantage of voice is that it is much harder to spoof and steal. "Voice is a dynamic form of biometrics, rather than static like a fingerprint, so it is harder to replicate and copy digitally," says Emmanuelle Filsjean, global head of marketing for ValidSoft, which advises retail banks on security and helps European governments tackle cross-border benefit fraud. Digital voiceprints contain over 100 identifiable elements. And, by using complex mathematical algorithms and the latest high-definition audio equipment, voice biometric companies believe they can now identify people accurately more than 97% of the time. Even identical twins, who share the same DNA, can be told apart from their voiceprints, making the technology reliable enough to be used as evidence in courts of law. Voice is crucial because call centres are still the main way we interact with companies, despite the rise of online banking and shopping. Traditional authentication measures, involving personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, and "memorable" answers to stock questions, have proved fallible, largely because we are fallible - we keep forgetting them. This is why we choose ludicrously simple PINs and passwords that are easy for us to remember - and therefore for others to guess. Fraud investigators have found that about 10% of four-digit PINs stolen by fraudsters are simply 1-2-3-4, while banks report legitimate customers failing call centre authentication procedures 10% to 20% of the time because they cannot remember their security details. "You can't forget your voice," says Prof Levent Arslan, chief executive of Sestek, a technology company that helped Turkish mobile phone company Avea register one million voiceprints in a year. Your voice is also easy to use. "Using our voice is the most intuitive way of interacting," says Ms Filsjean. While no biometrics security system is totally foolproof, fraudsters using high-definition recordings of someone's telephone pass phrase should still be caught out, voice biometrics companies maintain, because even the highest-quality recordings use some form of compression that blunts the highest and lowest frequencies. Even a slight mismatch with the customer's voiceprint will trigger a "live test" conversation that is almost impossible for fraudsters to spoof, particularly if they've only got a recording to use. Barclays' private banking arm, Barclays Wealth, claims great success after implementing voice biometrics. Before introducing the technology, it found that 25% of fraudulent phone calls to its agents were able to bypass the bank's security systems. Fraudsters using "social engineering" techniques - or blagging in the vernacular - were able to elicit security details from agents. The bank would not disclose how much money was being lost as a result. Barclays says that now the number of successful fraudulent calls is zero, because it uses technology from the company behind Apple iPhone's Siri speech recognition system, Nuance, a leader in the field. The voiceprints of suspected fraudsters are kept on a watchlist so they can be identified if they try again pretending to be someone else. Slovakian Tatra Bank is currently rolling out a voice biometric system that will authenticate customer identities while they are speaking to call centre agents. About 10 to 15 seconds of natural conversation is enough to match the voiceprint with the one the bank has on record. Turkish mobile phone operator, Turkcell, now has about 10 million customer voiceprints on its database. "Most financial institutions and big service providers around the world are actively considering adopting voice biometrics," says Almog Aley-Raz, head of voice biometrics for Nuance. The tricky part is enrolling customers in the scheme, as different jurisdictions have their own privacy laws governing voice recording. "In many cases there is ambiguity around the collection and use of biometrics," says Mr Aley-Raz. "But our best practice recommendation to our customers is to obtain consent for using the technology. "Regardless of whether a given jurisdiction has specific provision for the use of biometrics, biometric data is personal, private, and should be treated with the same care as any other data of that type." Voice biometrics alone is not enough to combat fraud, however. Other technologies, such as communications data analytics, must come into play. 'Profound' All UK financial institutions have had to record phone calls for years, and this has led to gargantuan amounts of data sitting in servers, largely ignored. But now audio and video search software, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, is making this data mountain much more easily accessible and useful. "The enormously sophisticated technologies that dig into written communication are now being switched to the spoken word," says Richard Newton, co-founder of OP3NVoice, a technology company specialising in searchable audio and video recording. "This has profound implications for fraud detection. Analysis of emotions, stress, sentiment, and meaning is a fast-developing area." What you say, how you say it, when, where and to whom, can all be weighted by algorithms that learn to spot suspicious or anomalous patterns of behaviour. As Glenn Perachio, forensics specialist at accountancy firm Ernst and Young, says: "It's like searching for a hay-coloured needle in a haystack, so you need to adopt techniques, such as machine learning, topic modelling, and geo-spatial mapping, to help narrow down the search for that evidence of malfeasance." Voice biometrics and speech analytics, it seems, are finally striking a true - and productive - note. </body>

      <title>Bringing more women to the Valley</title>
      <description>Google's advertising chief discusses how to have more women in Silicon Valley</description>

      <body>From Twitter lacking a single female on its board to sexist prank apps at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, the past few weeks have seen increased debate about the discrimination faced by women in Silicon Valley. The BBC World Service's Newshour gathered a range of women from the world's centre of technological innovation to ask: why aren't there more women in Silicon Valley? While being one of the most high profile women in Silicon Valley, Google's advertising chief Susan Wojcicki frequently sees the challenges women face in technology. Problems can often start before even reaching the workplace. She noticed that her son was taking over access to technology at home, and shutting off his sister. "My son, I realised, had basically monopolised the computer at home," she says. "My daughter had just given up and let him have it all the time and didn't think computers were that interesting." She tried to remedy this by sending her daughter to a technology-focused summer camp. However, her daughter came back complaining that there were too many boys. "I realise how easy it is for us just to let the girls kind of slip away," she says. Only a fifth of computer science graduates in the USA are female. Ms Wojcicki argues that we need women in technology if only to build better products. She cites studies which show that diverse teams come up with better products, and that as consumers of tech, women should also be more involved in creating these products in the first place. "We just bring different experiences to the table," she says. Furthermore, the growing dominance of tech means that in the near future most aspects of life will involve a technological element. Computer scientist Dr Telle Whitney agrees. She runs the Anita Borg Institute, a group which promotes gender diversity in Silicon Valley. She believes that computing knowledge is required to help solve many of our problems, from climate change to online education. "If you want to change the future, you want to be part of computing," Dr Whitney says. However, the issue isn't just that there aren't enough women going into tech. Women in the technology sector also drop out fast. Dr Whitney says women leave the industry twice as much as men. "They are just uncomfortable," she explains. Dr Whitney says there is a lot of unconscious sexism and the long hours also make it hard for women with families. Some women believe that Silicon Valley's very strengths can also give rise to a culture of discrimination persisting. "Silicon Valley is incredibly invested in its self-image as a meritocracy," says Basho's director of product management and blogger Shanley Kane, explaining the belief that anyone can make it with intelligence and hard work. "That very belief prevents us from actually critically examining the culture," she says. Furthermore, Ms Kane warns that certain men in the community make it hard for women to speak out, so many women simply don't. She points to the rise of the 'brogrammer' culture over the past five years - a type of young male programmer said to exhibit loud and brash behaviour. Ms Kane believes this move away from the stereotype of the reserved geek and towards a new hyper-masculine personality is an effort by some men to reclaim power. "We have an extremely aggressive, hyper-sexual, hyper-masculine stereotype of the geek that's starting to take over," she warns, "and that's extremely threatening to women." Women who do speak up, such as herself, can face harsh criticism. She believes this environment silences debate. "The overwhelming voice of women in technology about patriarchy and about oppression and about the problems we have is actually silence," she says. "Most women don't talk about it." "Silence is the default mode." The scrutiny women can face also leads some to feel under pressure to perform well at all times, or risk being dismissed for their gender. Kristen Pownell is a 19-year-old electrical engineering student at Stanford University. "This year I'm starting my electrical engineering core classes and when I walked into class on the first day I was shocked," Miss Pownell says. "My class is 50 people and there's three or four or maybe five girls there," she says. "It's really noticeable." She finds it intimidating being one of a handful of women and feels under pressure to prove herself. "I have this irrational fear that I'm representing all women everywhere and I need to prove myself in order to maintain femininity," she says. She believes support groups are valuable and make women feel less isolated, and she does outreach to girls in high schools, encouraging them to study science and technology. Perhaps the best way to address the problems women face is for more women to enter the industry. Ms Wojcicki is trying to encourage more women into tech and says there is a place for them. The tech world is creative and team orientated, she says, and enables people to build products which will be used around the world. By being part of the tech world she says they can also change the industry's culture. "If those girls all decide to come into this industry, they can change it," she says. "They can make it different and they can make it be for them in the way they want it to be." </body>

      <title>The retreat of free internet content</title>
      <description>Are the days of free-to-read net content numbered?</description>

      <body>Fortune writer Adam Lashinsky seemed stunned and bemused by the blowback from his readers. He had written about the 3G buyout of Heinz on the professional networking site LinkedIn, and added: "Fortune [where I work] published a longish preview of the article here. The full version is here, and you'll have to be a Fortune subscriber to read it. No apologies by the way. The kids say they can get everything they need to read for free on the internet. Sorry. It's not true." Readers erupted. The most "liked" comment, 319 up to the time of publishing, was this: "If your Fortune article is as empty of content as this LinkedIn article, I think I'll stick to the free sources. Please refrain from spam postings." Mr Lashinsky wrote a combative follow-up defending subscription. He was unapologetic. "As far as the readers of my post were concerned, I had committed the cardinal sin of social media, which was to link to an article for which they had to pay", he tells the BBC. "To paraphrase their response, how dare I tell them about something that was not available to them for free." So, are the battle lines being drawn between free and subscription? Tumbling ad revenues and circulation are hitting traditional newspapers hard, making some of them charge for content. "Advertising is weakening on newspaper sites and online sites because you can target the ads through Google and Facebook to individual people," says blogger Andrew Sullivan. He made the one-million-readers-a-month The Dish a standalone blog, taking it out of the Newsweek/Daily Beast site and charging readers $20 (£12.50) a year. "We media have to find another model that does not rely on advertising. It's not actually working financially in the long run," Mr Sullivan says. "Advertising-supported news was a glorious accident," adds Mr Lashinsky. "We need other revenue streams. Subscriptions are a good one." Many readers seem resistant to paying for online content. Some sites have designed metered models that recognise that. The New York Times brings down a pay curtain after 10 free articles a month. The Times, in the UK, makes the start of articles visible, and directs readers wanting to see more to pay to access the rest. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have a combination of pay, free and registration content. Some sites have promotions for free or reduced subscriptions, or bundles with other product and services offers. Into the picture has stepped Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, who brings to a historic title, the Washington Post, a dose of modern start-up and retail savvy. Computer science engineer Robert Cailliau is the often unheralded other half of the story of inventing the world wide web, alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The web was initially a system to connect the world's universities, which did not have a simple way of accessing each other's remotely stored academic papers and documents. Mr Cailliau, a Belgian, is now retired from Cern (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva) and lives in France. He says that the idea of "dealing with the value of information" has been around for 20 years. "It was impossible for someone to say, 'I worked very hard to put up this information to keep these articles up to date… I want you to pay me, say one cent every time you click on one of my pages.'" Mr Cailliau thinks that monthly subscriptions are too expensive and restrictive. He says the pay-as-you-go mobile phone model is a great one for online content. "When you send an SMS, you pay a small amount of money. Each individual action should be billed individually," he says. "My browser should pay you automatically a cent or two cents per page without me feeling it. I should not have to prepay a large amount of money." "Why re-invent? The telephone already does that. We already have a worldwide system that's capable of billing the customer for every move he makes." Tien Tzuo is chief executive of Zuora, a San Francisco subscription management company. Its clients include News International - parent company of the Times - and Fairfax, owners of some of the largest titles in Australia. "Two cents a view is one possible model, but not necessarily the best," he says. "Your wireless plan now has prepaid plans, post-paid plans, family plans, nights and weekend plans, unlimited plans, bundles. "And people actually do not like feeling metered, they don't like being on a phone call and feeling like they have to get off the phone." What does he think his fellow West Coast entrepreneur Mr Bezos brings to the newspaper business? "People forget that Amazon built warehouses and distribution centres - a bricks and mortars operation to go with the internet side," he answers. "For newspapers, some people still want the printed product on their commute on the bus or the train. "On weekends at the kitchen table, people like to spread out the Sunday papers, and take out their favourite section." Can online media survive without subscriptions? "No," says Mr Tzuo firmly. "For freemium models like Evernote and Dropbox, there's enormous value in the free product, but eventually you need customers to pay. That's the best economic foundation for your organisation. "The gravy train is over. There is no more advertising subsidies that can power newspapers." Digital platforms cost money to build, but we still get much of our online content for free. That may be changing, but the question of the most effective way of balancing reader browsing habits with businesses' need to be viable, is far from settled. </body>

      <body>It is nearly 12 years since Bram Cohen decided to create a faster way to share large files over the internet. His invention, the BitTorrent protocol, allows computers to download a single file from multiple sources simultaneously, and - at the same time - to upload the sections, as they become available, to others. It took a while for the technique to catch on, but it has become pirates' tool of choice to copy movies, music and other media. It also has legal uses. Mr Cohen is now the chief scientist at the San Francisco-based firm BitTorrrent. The company has teamed up with musicians including Madonna, Moby and the Pixies to help them share and sell content to fans via its Bundle product. It is also pitching its Sync service as a way to synchronise data between computers without sending the information to remote servers that could potentially be accessed by the NSA or other cyber-spies. The BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor met with Mr Cohen and asked him about his invention's legacy, and how having Asperger Syndrome had affected his work.

      <body>Instagram, the photo and video sharing network owned by Facebook, is usually associated with light-hearted 'selfie' photos, or amusing memes. But it also has a darker side, and has become a marketplace for a wide range of illicit goods. So long as you know the right hashtags to search. Thousands of pictures showing drugs on offer can be found on Instagram by searching keywords. In response to this investigation by #BBCTrending, Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comments, so we can take action." "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." BBC Trending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>
      <date>1383782700</date>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <body>There is a growing gulf between museums in London and elsewhere in the UK that has left some venues struggling to host exhibitions and facing closure, the Museums Association president has said. "We're beginning to go into a different world where the temperature's going right up," David Anderson warned. "Museums are beginning to close sites, they're beginning to reduce staffing." Speaking at the association's annual conference, he said the risk of closures would get "a lot worse". A Museums Association survey last month found that 23% of venues had seen their incomes drop by 10% in the previous year, while 21% said they had cut at least one in 10 staff. Local councils in England cut their funding to museums by an average of 11% in 2011-12, according to figures from the association. "That's a dramatic drop," said Mr Anderson, who is director of National Museum Wales He pointed to an unnamed but "reasonably large-sized regional museum" which had to turn down a free visiting exhibition from a national venue because it had cut staff and could not afford to install it. "That's the canary in the mine, that one," he said. "There are things happening now that we've not seen before, in this generation anyway." His comments follow a recent report that showed that cultural venues in London receive £69 of central government funding per resident, compared with £4.60 per head in the rest of England. Mr Anderson called on the funding to be made fairer but admitted that museums could do more to persuade politicians why they are "so critically important". Asked what would happen if the current trend continued, he replied: "We are going to end up very probably with a large focus on a few metropolitan areas and a tiny distribution of resource elsewhere. "Rather like the financial sector has sucked resource into London and exists in a world of its own, we're going to find that the arts world is in the process currently of sucking resource out of the nations and regions and into London, and a few other centres like Edinburgh, which are fairly wealthy as well. "You'll have a great separation. The wealthy institutions will get wealthier and the poor institutions will get poorer. That's exactly what will happen for the next two decades. It's slowly been happening - now it's gathering speed." Venues currently under threat include the Walsall Museum and the Whithorn Trust, which looks after historical sites in south-west Scotland, while the Science Museums Group recently rescinded a threat to close one of its attractions in either Bradford, Manchester or York. Meanwhile, new shadow culture minister Helen Goodman told delegates she was "really appalled" at the report on the difference between arts and culture funding in London and the rest of England. She also said any Labour government would not increase arts funding in the first year after taking office. "You will all readily accept that my colleagues who deal with the bedroom tax, disability, care for the elderly, to name but three, are ahead of me in the queue to [shadow chancellor] Ed Balls' door," she said. "So I cannot promise you new money in year one. Hard choices will still be needed. But I think we must and can look after and use the assets we do have much better." The Museums Association used the conference in Liverpool to announce that it had expelled Croydon Council for planning to sell 24 valuable Chinese ceramics. The council hopes the sale will raise money towards redeveloping Fairfield Halls, a 50-year-old concert hall, theatre and gallery. But selling items from a museum's collection is against the association's rules in most cases. </body>

      <description>Actor Mark Rylance is upstaged by his own dog as he performs Shakespeare on Broadway for the first time.</description>

      <body>Actor Mark Rylance has made his Broadway Shakespeare debut - but was upstaged by his own dog's performance. Apache, a Jack Russell Terrier, was reluctant to leave the Belasco Theatre stage, where Rylance is starring in Richard III and Twelfth Night. "He made an excellent entrance, but I'll have to teach him a few things about exits!" said Rylance, winner of two Tony awards. The actor plays the medieval monarch and noblewoman Olivia in the two plays. London's Globe Theatre is staging the productions, with Richard III in the afternoon and Twelfth Night in the evening - a total of six hours of theatre. The company, putting on Shakespeare on Broadway for the first time, is following the Tudor tradition of having an all-male cast playing all of the roles, including the female ones. Rylance, who added that his dog was also making his New York theatrical debut, was called "astonishing" in a review by Ben Brantley of the New York Times. "This is how Shakespeare was meant to be done," he added. The two plays and gender-swapping roles allow him to be "as brilliant in trousers as he is in a dress", added the review. Marilyn Stasio, writing in Variety, said that Rylance's portrayal of Richard III was "an assassin consumed less by envy and hatred of his victims than loathing for his own twisted self." Stephen Fry, making his New York stage debut as Malvolio in Twelfth Night, was praised for his sympathetic portrayal of the usually malevolent character. The New York Times said: "Malvolio is refreshingly embodied by Mr. Fry with the complacency and affectation of someone you might recognize from your own office." Brantley said that the two productions were "a source of radiant illumination for the audience, while the bewilderment of the characters onstage floods us with pure, tickling joy. "I can't remember being so ridiculously happy for the entirety of a Shakespeare performance since - let me think - August 2002." He went on to explain this was when he last saw Twelfth Night at the Globe Theatre in London, starring Mark Rylance. Both plays are due to continue at the Belasco Theatre until 30 November. </body>

      <body>The stars of a new stage adaptation of Jeeves and Wooster have said the popularity of dramas like Downton Abbey could boost the new show's box office. Stephen Mangan and Ripper Street's Matthew MacFadyen respectively play the hapless toff and his faithful valet. Mangan said: "It's almost a fantasy, that turn of the century England where people are good eggs." "It's a bit like the Downton vision of England and it was hugely popular in America for that reason." "It's just like Downton because we like to see this prettied up version of England," he said. The new show. Perfect Nonsense, is directed by Sean Foley and is based on PG Wodehouse's 1938 novel The Code of the Woosters. The story sees Bertie Wooster unwittingly called on to play matchmaker - reconciling the affections of Madeline Bassett with his newt-fancying acquaintance Gussie Fink-Nottle. Wodehouse, who died in 1975, aged 93, is undergoing something of a revival. Earlier this year, BBC One broadcast a TV adaptation of his Blandings Castle stories, with another series commissioned for next year. Birdsong author Sebastian Faulks has also written a new book, Jeeves and The Wedding Bells, after being asked by the Wodehouse estate to bring the "immortal" characters to life. "I hope my story will ring bells with aficionados, but also bring new readers to these wonderful books," he added. The characters were memorably played on TV by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the 1990s. Mangan, star of Green Wing and Episodes, holds Wodehouse up as one of the funniest writers of all time, and said his enduring popularity would stand the new show in good stead. "The Wodehouse fan base is already massive and we've had a lot of interest from the moment it was announced that we were doing it because apart from a musical that Lloyd Webber did in the 70s, they've never been played on stage. "But yes, fans of Downton, anyone who likes period drama, will maybe look our way." Jeeves and Wooster opens on 12 November. </body>

      <title>Iranian band members shot dead in NY</title>
      <description>Three Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, are shot dead by another Iranian musician in what police called a murder-suicide.</description>

      <body>Four Iranian-expatriate musicians living in Brooklyn, New York, have been shot dead in what authorities are labelling a murder-suicide. Two members of the group Yellow Dogs and a third artist were slain by a fellow musician, Ali Akbar Mahammadi Rafie, who later took his own life. Police believe the attack happened as Rafie, 29, was upset after being thrown out of another band. Two of those killed had just received political asylum in the US. They were brothers and members of the Yellow Dogs, who described themselves on their Twitter feed as "a Post Punk/Dance Punk band from Tehran/Iran, living in Brooklyn at the moment". Gunfire rang out early on Monday as Rafie climbed from the roof on to a third-floor terrace where he opened fire through a window, shooting dead Ali Eskandarian, 35, a musician, said police. Arash Farazmand, 28, the Yellow Dogs drummer, was found dead on the same level of the apartment. His brother, Soroush Farazmand, 27, the band's guitarist, was using his laptop in bed when he received fatal gunshot injuries. The Yellow Dogs' two other members were not at the flat at the time of the killing. According to police, another unidentified tenant was hit in the arm as Rafie and a former fellow band mate from a group called the Free Keys struggled over the gun. Rafie retrieved ammunition that had fallen out of the firearm, went to the roof and shot himself in the head, said police. The person wounded in the arm was taken to hospital and is said to be in stable condition. Rafie "was upset that he wasn't in the band anymore", said New York Police Department spokesman John McCarthy. Investigators believe the gunman and his former Free Keys members, may have had an argument over money, but it was unclear why he shot at members of the Yellow Dogs. The rifle was found next to Rafie's body, according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. He said it had been purchased in New York state in 2006, and police were tracking its history. Police are investigating whether a guitar case found near the scene was used to carry the assault rifle in the attack. The Yellow Dogs were well-known among young Iranian expatriates in the US, reports Bahman Kalbasi of the BBC Persian service. Ali Salehezadeh, the band's manager, said the gunman knew the victims but had not spoken to them in months because of a "petty conflict". "There was a decision not to be around each other," he said. "They were never that close to begin with. We thought it was all behind us." The shooting took place in Brooklyn's East Williamsburg neighbourhood, known for its edgy, creative vibe and community of artists and musicians. The band members had lived in the neighbourhood. "They seem like really nice guys," a local man, Martin Greenman, told the New York Daily News. "They didn't seem to be in any way to be violent guys. They weren't rabble rousers or anything like that." Mr Salehezadeh said the victims' relatives were stunned. "People don't own guns in Iran," he said. "We don't have this problem there. It doesn't exist." Members of an Iranian band with the same name were interviewed by US consulate officials in Istanbul in 2009 as they applied for a visa for a US tour, according to a diplomatic cable leaked to Wikileaks. They described the "small but crazy" underground rock scene in Tehran, saying it was the community that offered "the most free expression" in Iran. </body>

      <title>Royal press charter 'bonkers'</title>
      <description>Former BBC chairman Lord Grade tells the Society of Editors the cross-party royal charter on press regulation is "bonkers".</description>

      <body>Former BBC chairman Lord Grade has called the cross-party royal charter on press regulation "bonkers". He said that giving politicians "the opportunity to amend statutory press regulation cannot be in the public interest". But Lord Grade also told the Society of Editors: "We should never forget where this sorry trail began: With journalists behaving badly." "The press, in other words, has brought this situation on itself," he added. In his speech, Lord Grade, who is currently a member of the Press Complaints Commission, said: "It certainly does at times seem as if tabloid journalists leave their humanity and their conscience at home when they head for the newsroom. "You do wonder how some of them sleep at night." The issue of press regulation emerged following the phone-hacking scandal and subsequent Leveson Inquiry into the ethics and practices of newspapers. Lord Grade accused MPs of being "comprehensively hijacked" by the Hacked Off lobby group, which led the campaign for tighter press regulation. Its high-profile supporters included a number of celebrities who were victims of alleged phone hacking, including actors Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant. "So eager were our elected representatives to show just how deeply they shared the public's outrage, that they handed what looked like a veto on [press regulation] to the unelected representatives of Hacked Off as they drafted," Lord Grade said. The new royal charter on press regulation was granted by the Privy Council in October. It will create a watchdog to oversee a new press regulator. Media organisations will be free to sign up or stay outside the new system of regulation. But, Lord Grade argued, news editors "must be accountable publicly" through independent regulation, adding, "they must be prepared not only to argue the public interest in publishing, but also to defend the ethics of their news gathering." Political interference, Lord Grade added, would cross "a red line". Using the BBC - of which he was chairman from 2004-2006 - as an example, Lord Grade said MPs debate but do not vote on the licence fee, despite it being a publicly-owned broadcaster. This, he insisted, "protects the editorial freedom of the BBC from political interference". But "as things now stand, Parliament will have more right to interfere in the editorial freedom of the press than it does in the editorial freedom of the BBC". "Bonkers, or what?" He said that, while the new charter will offer protection from exemplary damages for those who volunteer to sign up, "the implication of this is, of course, that those newspapers who don't sign up will run the risk of incurring those exemplary - or rather, punitive damages." "In other words," he continued, "There's a carrot to attract the press, but there's also a stick - potentially a very large and very expensive stick - available to beat up the press who don't like the look of the carrot." The Society of Editors, founded in 1999, represents almost 450 national, regional and local newspapers, magazines, broadcasters and websites. It campaigns for media freedom and freedom of expression and information. During his speech, Lord Grade voiced his support for the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which has been put forward by a group of major newspaper publishers. Its proposals include the power to investigate serious and systemic breaches of its code, even if no complaints have been made, and the power to levy fines of up to £1m. "Let's really get behind Ipso and get it up and running as soon as possible," he said. "Let's keep our minds open and let's be prepared to tighten things up if experience shows it's necessary. "Above all, let's do our damnedest to restore public confidence." </body>

      <body>A performance artist has been detained in Moscow after stripping naked and nailing his scrotum to the cobblestones of Red Square in a protest. Pyotr Pavlensky, 29, reportedly sat for an hour and a half on the square on Sunday afternoon, with a nail driven through his genitals into the ground. The St Petersburg performer had faced a custodial sentence of 15 days but was freed on Monday. Pavlensky said his "Fixation" act was a metaphor for apathy in Russia. Critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin accuse him of presiding over a crackdown on dissent since his re-election in March last year. Timing his act to coincide with Police Day, Pavlensky said in a statement: "When the authorities turn the country into one big prison, openly robbing the populace and channelling funds to increase and enrich the police and other security agencies, society accepts arbitrariness and, having forgotten its advantage in numbers, brings the triumph of the police state closer through its inaction." His graphic act outside the Lenin Mausoleum was recorded on video which was put online before being blocked by leading social media, the Russian news website grani.ru reports. Clips continued to appear on Monday. A judge who examined his case on Monday ruled that the documents had been incorrectly presented, Russian news website TV Rain reports. It was not immediately clear if he would be re-arrested. Pavlensky previously attracted attention by sewing his lips together in July of last year and demonstrating outside St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral in support of the imprisoned Pussy Riot protesters. In May of this year, he wrapped his naked body in a "cocoon" of barbed wire outside the city's parliament. Fellow figures from the Russian arts world praised his Red Square act in comments on grani.ru, with one calling it a "powerful gesture of absolute despair" and another, "a manifesto of powerlessness". Others asked how security forces patrolling Red Square could have allowed Pavlensky to get away with his performance so long. One blogger quipped on Twitter: "The artist Pavlensky nails micro-bloggers to his testicles". </body>

      <body>Hundreds of hopefuls who missed out on auditioning for the latest Star Wars film will be allowed to submit an application online. Open auditions began in Bristol on Saturday, however the queue was closed before the session officially opened after too many people turned up. Now, producer Lucasfilm has said prospective cast members can send in a video application. Hopefuls must submit their audition through Cast It Talent's website. Producers are looking to cast two lead roles for Star Wars: Episode VII - a "street smart" girl in her late teens and a "smart, capable" man in his early 20s. Other open auditions are still to be held in Manchester, Glasgow, Dublin and London in the coming weeks. Lucasfilm said casting directors saw some 2,500 people in Bristol over the weekend. Many who missed out on Saturday's session camped overnight at the city's Arnolfini Arts Centre to be seen on Sunday. Security at the auditions told the Bristol Post about the same number of people were turned away without being seen because of the pressure of numbers. "The whole process was a complete and utter mess," said Josh McGrillen from Ross-on-Wye. "They had no infrastructure to handle the hundreds of people who turned up. "Many like me were turned away just because we weren't queuing obscenely early in the morning. "Some sort of pre-application process should've been used because some people travelled from afar and forked out just to get to Bristol." Hayley Mogridge told the BBC her son had arrived for the auditions at 10:45am, and was turned away after waiting "two hours in the rain". He then spent "his student loan on a cheap hotel" in the hopes of making the Sunday session. Barbara Gamlen, a publicist for Lucasfilm, said 75 of those who auditioned on Saturday were called back to read a generic script in front of the Star Wars team. She added she expected a similar number to be called back from Sunday's crop of hopefuls. Auditions also began in the US, with more than 4,000 people seen in St Louis, Missouri, on Sunday. </body>

      <body>Marvel superhero blockbuster Thor: The Dark World pounded its rivals at the North American box office, taking $86.1m (£53.8m) in its opening weekend. The sequel to the 2011 movie sees Chris Hemsworth reprise his role as the god of thunder who battles to save Earth from evil forces. Bad Grandpa, from the makers of Jackass, held the number two spot for a second week, taking $11.3m (£7.1m). Animated film Free Birds was just behind at three with $11.2m (£7m). The film features the voices of Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson as a pair of turkeys who try to keep their kind off Thanksgiving dinner plates. Last Vegas, featuring Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline as four friends who reunite for a stag party, fell one place to four. Last week's number one, Ender's Game, tumbled down the chart in its second week to five. Industry forecasts had predicted the second Thor instalment would debut with at least $90m (£56m). It missed that target but did surpass the original film, which opened with $65.7m (£41m). "It's a great start," Dave Hollis, executive vice president of distribution for Walt Disney Studios said, adding Disney would have considered "anything north of $80m (£50m) to be a good result." Including international markets - where the movie has been playing since 30 October - the film has now taken some $327m (£204m) globally. </body>

      <title>Court overturns Lissadell ruling</title>
      <description>The Irish Supreme Court overturns a High Court judgment that there were public rights of way to Lissadell House estate - a favourite haunt of writer W B Yeats - in the Republic of Ireland.</description>

      <body>The Irish Supreme Court has overturned a High Court judgement that there were public rights of way to Lissadell House estate in the Republic of Ireland. The court found there were no such rights of way, except for a small part of an avenue with access to the coast. Lissadell House was the ancestral home of the Gore-Booths and was made famous in a poem by W B Yeats. The case is one of the longest and most expensive property disputes in the history of the Irish state. It involved the house owners and Sligo County Council over right-of-way access. The 19th-century mansion Lissadell, which sits on 400 acres of land in County Sligo, was bought in 2003 by Edward Walsh and Constance Cassidy for 4.55m euros (£3.8m). They spent millions restoring it before opening it to the public. They argued they could not grant an untrammelled right of way for reasons of security, insurance and maintenance. As a result of the council's decision, the couple closed the estate in 2009 although it was attracting 40,000 visitors a year. They also let 11 staff go. In a statement at the time, they said it had become impossible to operate the house as a historic house or private home. "No property whatsoever, let alone a large tourist facility, could be operated on the basis of unregulated, uncontrolled and unfettered access," they said. Lissadell is one of the Republic of Ireland's most historic premises and was the childhood home of high profile rebel Countess Markiewicz. The house featured in a poem by W B Yeats, for whom it was a favourite haunt. Countess Markiewicz fought alongside the Irish insurgents during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. She was condemned to death by the British authorities, but her sentence was later quashed and she was imprisoned instead. After refusing to take her seat as the first woman MP at Westminster, she later sat as a member of the first Dail, the Irish parliament. The case has already been the subject of a 58-day high court hearing estimated to cost 6m euros (£5m). The Supreme Court judgment will have serious implications for Sligo County Council, which had argued there was an inferred dedication of public right of way through decades of public use. </body>

      <body>The Fox TV network has given the go-ahead to a new 13-episode animation called Bordertown by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, according to TV Guide. The show centres on two families living in a small town along the US-Mexico border. One is headed by a border patrol agent, the other by an industrious Mexican immigrant. It is the first new animation from MacFarlane since Family Guy spinoff The Cleveland Show in 2009. The comedy writer, who scored a box office hit with the profane, surreal comedy Ted, also hosted this year's Oscars - to decidedly mixed reviews. Bordertown has been co-created by Family Guy executive producer Mark Hentemann, and is due to be aired in the US next year. In May this year, it was reported that The Cleveland Show was to be cancelled. MacFarlane's American Dad, now in its tenth season, is set to move from Fox to rival broadcaster TBS. </body>

      <body>Singer Geri Halliwell ditched a performance of her comeback song on Australia's Got Talent final after it stalled in the charts. The former Spice Girl, who is a judge on the show, opted to sing a version of the group's debut hit Wannabe. Half of Me sold just 393 copies, leading Halliwell to write on her blog: "I'm not afraid to say - I lost!" She added that her replacement choice of song felt "honest, just like home, for you and I, for all of us." The singer said that when she heard the news of her chart placing, she "laughed nervously, God that's really bad!" and admitted that "deep down" she was "gutted". She went on to explain that performing the song "with gusto" might push it higher in the charts, but it would be better to admit that it hadn't "connected" with the Australian public. The Australian singles chart was topped by X Factor winner Dami, whose song shifted more than 44,000 copies. The performance of Halliwell's comeback is in stark contrast to her earlier solo career, which boasted a string of chart-topping hits in the UK and around the world, including Bag It Up, Mi Chico Latino and a cover of The Weather Girls' It's Raining Men. </body>

      <body>Detention sheets describing Beatle John Lennon's schoolboy misdemeanours are being put up for sale. Teachers from Liverpool's Quarry Bank High School for Boys wrote that 15-year-old Lennon was punished for "fighting in class" and "sabotage". The two documents from 1955 were rescued by a teacher in the 1970s who had been told to burn all of the books in a storage room at the school. The sheets are expected to be sold for up to £3,000 each at auction. The documents reveal that on two occasions Lennon received three detentions in one day. Other reasons given by his teachers for punishment include "nuisance", "shoving" and "just no interest whatsoever". The sheets cover the periods when he was in Class 3B between 19 May and 23 June 1955, and in Class 4C from 25 November 1955 to 13 February 1956. Lennon went on to meet Paul McCartney in 1957 and together they formed the Beatles, who had their first hit in late 1962 with the song Love Me Do. That kick-started a career which brought fame and fortune and songs that have influenced generations of musicians since. The details of the young Lennon's detentions were discovered by an enterprising teacher in the late 1970s. He had been asked to clear out a storage room to make space for a newly-appointed teacher and had been instructed to burn all the books stored in the room. But spotting the name "Lennon" in the top of some of the pages he realised they related to the famous former student and tore the sheets from the book to retain as a keepsake. A number of the pages he had taken out of the book and kept were destroyed at a later date in an accident involving chemicals. Other sheets he gave away but these pages are some of the few that have survived. The sheets have been authenticated by Lennon's close school friend, Pete Shotton, who wrote a book John Lennon: In My Life. Peter Beech, who was Lennon's general science teacher at the time, said: "The sheet is typical of John Lennon, he was an extremely cheeky boy. "He did, however, know his limits. In the classroom, if you settled John down, you generally settled the class down. "His chemistry teacher Eric Oldman said that John could actually go far." Lennon was shot dead aged 40 outside his New York apartment on 8 December 1980 by Mark Chapman. Online bidding for the detention sheets and other items of Beatles memorabilia starts at TrackAuction.com on 22 November.

      <title>Burrell collection tour wins backing</title>
      <description>Moves to allow Glasgow's Burrell Collection to go on loan overseas, against the wishes of the shipping magnate who assembled it, are backed by MSPs.</description>

      <body>Moves to allow Glasgow's Burrell Collection to go overseas, against the wishes of the shipping magnate who assembled it, have been backed by MSPs. Sir William Burrell gifted more than 8,000 items to the city with a condition not to loan them overseas. Glasgow City Council has introduced a Private Bill at the Scottish Parliament to relax the terms of the bequest. It wants to change this as part of plans to close and revamp the museum which houses the collection. The collection, which includes medieval, Chinese, French and Islamic art, has been housed in the museum in Pollok Park since 1983. Trustees and Glasgow Life, which runs the museum on behalf of Glasgow City Council, have said the museum needs a significant overhaul. They have outlined a revamp plan which would see the attraction close in 2016 and reopen in 2020. This would allow the creation of extra gallery space, allowing more items to be displayed. During the closure period, they hope to lend works from the collection within the UK and overseas. A specially convened Burrell Collection (Lending and Borrowing) (Scotland) Bill Committee at Holyrood concluded that the "time has come to allow the collection to be seen by a wider audience". It recommended that the general principles of the bill be agreed to. It will now seek support from the full Scottish Parliament. Sir William donated his artworks to the city of Glasgow in 1944, along with £250,000 to build a museum to house it. One of his conditions required the art to be displayed in a rural setting away from the pollution of Glasgow, which he was concerned could lead to the deterioration of his collection of tapestries and carpets. Burrell died in 1958 at the age of 96, without ever seeing his objects in their final home. It took until 1983 for the right home to be found, when the Burrell Collection finally opened in Glasgow's Pollok Country Park. Another condition laid down by Sir William was that the collection should only be loaned to suitable institutions in Britain, as he was concerned about the risks of overseas transportation. As a result, the Burrell Collection has been turning down about 30 applications a year for loans of exhibits. Committee convener Joan McAlpine said: "Our committee is persuaded that it is sometimes appropriate to depart from the wishes of benefactors, particularly if the circumstances which may have led them to adopt a certain position have changed. "The committee supports the aim of raising the collection's profile and increasing access to its treasures, believing that Burrell wished the collection to be shown." The SNP MSP said it was much safer to transport artworks overseas now than it would have been in Burrell's day. Glasgow City Council welcomed the committee's decision. Depute leader and chair of Glasgow Life, Councillor Archie Graham, said: "We're delighted that the committee has backed our plans and this marks another huge step towards sharing Sir William's outstanding vision with an international audience whilst we refurbish the building which has been its home for the last 30 years. "We have an agreement in place which fully addresses the concerns Sir William had about sending objects abroad whilst recognising that the shipping and conservation of such precious items has developed significantly in the 60 years since Sir William made his bequest to Glasgow." The committee decided against a specific exclusion on the lending of fragile items, saying loans should be granted on a case-by-case basis. The report said the committee were aware of the "risks and ethical questions inherent in altering the terms of Sir William's bequest". But they were persuaded that the trustees and Glasgow Life, which operates the museum, would act responsibly to ensure the safekeeping of the collection. The report also said that allowing the collection to tour other venues would raise revenue, although it was not convinced it would generate the £15m needed to refurbish the current building. </body>

      <body>Helen Mirren and Billie Piper are going head to head for best actress at the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards. The pair were previously in competition at this year's Olivier Awards, where Dame Helen took the prize for her portrayal of the Queen in The Audience. Piper is nominated for her role in clinical drugs trial drama The Effect, which is also up for best play. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rory Kinnear and Adrian Lester are in contention for best actor. Lester and Kinnear played Othello and Iago in the National Theatre production of Shakespeare's tragedy, while Ejiofor portrayed Congolese independence campaigner Patrice Lumumba in the Young Vic's A Season in the Congo. The best actress category also includes Kristin Scott Thomas for her part in a revival of Harold Pinter's Old Times; Linda Bassett, for her performance in Arnold Wesker's Roots; and Lesley Manville, for Ibsen's Ghosts. The winners will be announced at a ceremony, presented by Homeland star Damian Lewis, at the Savoy Hotel in London on 17 November. The past, present and future artistic directors of the National Theatre - Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner and Rufus Norris - compete against each other in the best director category. Current boss Sir Nicholas is up for Othello, the incoming Rufus Norris for his revival of James Baldwin's The Amen Corner, and Sir Richard (in charge from 1988 to 1997) for Ghosts at the Almeida. The fourth director on the shortlist is Lyndsey Turner, for Lucy Kirkwood's Chimerica. Chimerica, which earned a flood of five-star reviews when it opened at the Almeida and transferred to the Harold Pinter Theatre in the West End, is up for best play alongside Nick Dear's The Dark Earth and the Light Sky (also at the Almeida) and The Effect (National). Broadway hit The Book of Mormon, by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, goes up against Tori Amos's The Light Princess and a revival of Stephen Sondheim's Merrily We Roll Along for best musical. This year's awards feature a new category for best musical performance, with Rosalie Craig (The Light Princess), Cynthia Erivo (The Color Purple) and Charlotte Wakefield (The Sound of Music) on the shortlist. As well as his best actor nomination, Kinnear is among the three contenders for most promising playwright for his debut drama, The Herd, at the Bush Theatre. He is up against Phoebe Waller-Bridge for her one-woman play, Fleabag, and Rachel De-lahay for Routes at the Royal Court. The outstanding newcomer category features Caoilfhionn Dunne (The Night Alive, Donmar Warehouse), Seth Numrich (Sweet Bird of Youth, Old Vic), Luke Thompson (A Midsummer Night's Dream, Shakespeare's Globe) and Olivia Vinall (Othello, National). The best design contenders are Bob Crowley (People, The Audience and Once), Es Devlin (Chimerica), and Tim Hatley and Peter Mumford (Ghosts). The award winners are decided by a panel of six theatre critics and the London Evening Standard's editor, Sarah Sands. "This shortlist is one of our strongest in years," Ms Sands said. "The West End is in rude health, established schemes such as NT Live have really come into their own, bringing theatre to a wider audience and inspiring others to come up with new ideas." </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>Former Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens is to star in Night at the Museum 3 with Ben Stiller and Robin Williams. Stevens, who played Matthew Crawley in the ITV period drama, has been cast as the villain Lancelot, the Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. The third film in the hit franchise will be set in London and will see the return of Stiller as security guard Dan and Williams as Teddy Roosevelt. Shawn Levy, who directed the first two films, also returns for the third. Shooting will begin in February 2014. Stevens shot to fame in Downton Abbey, which first aired in 2010, but he chose to leave the series in 2012. His character was dramatically killed off in last year's Christmas special. Stevens appeared on Broadway in 2012 in The Heiress opposite Hollywood actress Jessica Chastain. Since then, he has appeared in period film Summer in February and Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate with Benedict Cumberbatch. The latter was a box office flop and received mixed reviews. Stevens can next be seen in the upcoming thriller A Walk Among the Tombstones. The finale of the fourth series of Downton Abbey airs on ITV on Sunday. </body>

      <description>Director Lynne Ramsay denies being sued by the producers of a western film starring Natalie Portman.</description>

      <body>Director Lynne Ramsay has denied being sued by producers of the film Jane Got A Gun starring Natalie Portman. According to court papers acquired by the Hollywood Reporter last week, producers had filed a legal action against the Scottish director. Ramsay left the film a day before shooting started and producers claimed her last-minute departure caused delay. But according to Screen Daily, a statement from Ramsey's team says she has not been served with a lawsuit. The statement, issued on Saturday, read: "Lynne Ramsay has not been served with this lawsuit and, when she is, she will respond in court and not in the media. "That said, the allegations as recently reported are simply false. Lynne looks forward to presenting the truth about this situation in the proper forum." The court papers obtained by the Hollywood Reporter stated that Ramsay was paid $750,000 (£466,000) to work on the western screenplay and to direct. They also alleged Ramsay "was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive". The legal action further alleged that Ramsey, who was Bafta-nominated for We Need To Talk About Kevin, endangered crew members "when she pointed a prop gun directly at a camera and, in turn, at the camera crew before first taking proper precautions". Portman - who is also one of the film's producers - reportedly showed up for the first day of shooting in New Mexico in March unaware that Ramsay had quit the day before. Three actors left alongside Ramsay - Michael Fassbender, Jude Law and Bradley Cooper. Ewan McGregor was then brought in to star with Portman and Gavin O'Connor to direct. According to a report in the Hollywood Reporter, Ramsay had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was set to begin. Earlier this year, Ramsay served on the prize jury at the Cannes Film Festival alongside Stephen Spielberg and Nicole Kidman. </body>

      <body>Eminem has become the first US artist to have seven consecutive number ones in the UK album chart. The rapper topped the UK album chart on Sunday with his latest studio record, The Marshall Mathers LP 2. But his collaboration with Rihanna, The Monster, was knocked off the top of the UK singles chart by Storm Queen's Look Right Through. It was the first British number one for the US DJ, who remixed the underground track to make it more chart-friendly. With Monster dropping to second, Little Mix scored the next highest new entry with Move, the first single from their upcoming second album, Salute. Royals, from 16-year-old New Zealand singer/songwriter Lorde, slipped two places to number four, while One Direction's Story of My Life slid one place to number five. Britney Spears scored her 23rd UK top 10 single with Work Bitch at number seven. Ed Sheeran's I See Fire, his first new solo track for two years, went in at number 13. It features on the soundtrack of the second instalment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Eminem's number one album is a continuation of his first UK chart number one from 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP. 2012 X Factor winner James Arthur enjoyed a new entry at number two with his self-titled debut album. Tinie Tempah's Demonstration, Andre Rieu and Johann Strauss Orchestra's Music of the Night and The Overtones's Saturday Night at the Movies were at three, four and five respectively, ensuring this week's top five albums were all new entries. Former Westlife star Shane Filan's solo debut, You and Me, entered the chart at number six. </body>

      <title>Sia gives Eminem money to LGBT cause</title>
      <description>Gay singer Sia donates proceeds from her Eminem collaboration Beautiful Pain to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, after critics attacked his use of homophobic lyrics.</description>

      <body>Australian singer Sia will donate proceeds from her recent collaboration with Eminem, a track called Beautiful Pain, to the LA Gay and Lesbian Center. She recorded the duet for the rapper's new album, which features a series of homophobic slurs on the song Rap God. Sia, who identifies herself as "queer", said she was "anxious" after hearing the track. She eventually decided to give her fee to homeless LGBT youths after blogger Keo Nozari confronted her on Twitter. He criticised Eminem's "hate speech" as "wholly insensitive to human rights". Nozari, who later wrote about their Twitter discussion in a Huffington Post blog, cited Rap God's offensive lyrics - including the line "you fags think it's all a game" - and referenced recent incidents of bullying and suicide, before asking "How is this good for LGBT kids?" Sia, who had a UK number one last year as the vocalist on David Guetta's Titanium, initially defended Eminem. "I know personally that he is not homophobic, but a performance artist," she tweeted. "I would never work with someone I believed to be homophobic. I respect that he can be misinterpreted in the worst way by the ignorami, and that scares me, but I respect him as an artist and person." However, Nozari replied: "What happens behind the scenes is invisible to most. [There is an] argument to be made [that] what an artist expresses publicly in their work matters most." He continued: "Fortunately I'm a grown, confident man. But for vulnerable kids in our community these words affect them deeply." Sia's vocals and song-writing skills are currently in demand and she has recently penned tracks for Britney Spears, Rihanna and Katy Perry. Her track Elastic Heart, a collaboration with The Weeknd and Diplo, will also feature on the soundtrack to the forthcoming fantasy sequel The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. "I am queer, and love my queers, young and old," said Sia on Twitter. "I work with the Center and homeless LGBT kids, and when I heard Rap God I was very anxious." She attributed Eminem's homophobic lyrics to his character Slim Shady who "represents the worst and darkest bile of America", but she added she could "see how it can be unclear" for young people. Sia concluded that she would think about her discussion with Nozari. The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center later confirmed on Twitter that the singer had decided to donate a portion of the proceeds from Beautiful Pain to it. Eminem was questioned about his use of homophobic phrases when interviewed by Rolling Stone this year, when he suggested he did not equate the words he used to homosexuality. Eminem said: "I think people know my personal stance on things and the personas that I create in my music." He continued: "And if someone doesn't understand that by now, I don't think there's anything I can do to change their mind about it." </body>

      <body>ITV period drama Downton Abbey has announced a fifth series, as the fourth series of the hit show draws to a close. "We promise all the usual highs and lows, romance, drama and comedy," said Gareth Neame, director of Downton Abbey creators Carnival Films. Julian Fellowes will return to write the series, which is expected to air next year. The latest series has had average viewing figures of 11.8 million. "With Julian writing and Gareth (Neame) and Liz (Trubridge) producing, we know it will be as warm, witty, romantic and dramatic as previous series and we can't wait to catch up with our favourite characters again," said ITV's director of drama commissioning, Steve November. Downton Abbey debuted on British TV screens in 2010 and has since been sold in more than 220 territories. 12.3 million Americans tuned in to the finale of series three in February, making it the highest-rated show of the day, and breaking the viewership record for broadcaster PBS. In June, it was announced that Oscar-nominated US actor Paul Giamatti is to join the cast of Downton, starting with the Christmas episode. He will star alongside Elizabeth McGovern as Harold, the "maverick, playboy" brother of Lady Grantham. Shirley MacLaine will also reprise her role as Martha Levinson - Lady Grantham's mother - in the Christmas special. The current series sparked controversy over a storyline that saw housemaid Anna attacked and raped by a guest's valet. The broadcaster received 200 complaints after the show was aired on 6 October, while media watchdog Ofcom received 250. However the watchdog later said it had decided not to pursue the complaints "after careful assessment... because they did not raise issues warranting investigation". </body>

      <body>Strictly Come Dancing contestant Natalie Gumede has been ordered to rest after being taken to hospital following a fainting episode during rehearsals. A Strictly spokesman said the former Coronation Street actress, 29, would see a doctor on Monday. Gumede was checked by the Strictly medical team on site and then taken to AandE after falling ill before Saturday's live show. She will be allowed to continue in next week's show if she is well enough. One celebrity will still leave on Sunday, the show confirmed. In their last performance on Saturday 2 November, Gumede and dance partner Artem Chigvintsev, finished four points ahead of their nearest rivals. The pair finished with 38 points from the show's judges four points ahead of Patrick Robinson, Abbey Clancy and Susanna Reid. A BBC spokesman said: "Natalie Gumede will not perform in tonight's Strictly Come Dancing after fainting twice during rehearsals today. "She has been checked by the medical team on site, and will be going to AandE as a precaution." The spokesman said that in accordance with the show's rules, Gumede would still go through to next week's show. Presenter Claudia Winkleman said that if Gumede was passed medically fit she would dance next week in Blackpool. At the beginning of the show, host Tess Daly confirmed Gumede had been taken ill and would not be dancing. The soap star, who had been due to perform a jive to Tina Turner's hit Proud Mary, had tweeted earlier on Saturday: "The old bones are tired today." But she added: "Channeling Tina will get me through. Gotta make Mary Proud! #scd". A medic revealed more about Gumede's collapse, saying, "I was radioed to come to the dancefloor where Natalie had collapsed. It became apparent that she had fainted." And Chigvintsev said of his dance partner: "She was shaking a lot and crying. I am just gutted for her. She is doing such a great job and I just want to say 'Please get better'." Last week the first 10s of the series were awarded to the actress, best known for portraying Kirsty Soames in Coronation Street, and her partner Artem for their Viennese waltz. Last month, Gumede missed rehearsals for the 19 October show because of an injury. She had an MRI scan to see if she had slipped a disc in her back, but was later given the all-clear. Gumede, from Burnley, is currently one of the favourites to win the dancing competition. Strictly drew its biggest audience of the series so far last week with an average of 10 million tuning in on Saturday - maintaining its lead over ITV rival The X Factor, which drew 7.9 million viewers. </body>

      <body>Most of us love to come up with a beautifully-crafted phrase from time to time, but few of us succeed. A new book by Mark Forsyth called The Elements of Eloquence examines what makes a beautiful sentence. Key elements include the AABA pattern (also known as diacope) which is very common: "Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo." Another rhetorical device is antithesis - the use of opposites in the same sentence - as deployed by Charles Dickens and then singer Katy Perry. First broadcast on the Today programme on Monday 11 November. </body>

      <title>A Victorian model's tragic story</title>
      <description>A Victorian model's tragic story set for the stage</description>

      <body>In 1849, Lizzie Siddal was plucked from obscurity to pose for some of the best-known painters of the Victorian art world. Now her tragic life story is being brought to the stage for the first time. Elizabeth Siddal has been described by one biographer as a "Pre-Raphaelite supermodel". The most well-known story about her time as a painter's subject is when she almost died while posing in a bathtub for Sir John Everett Millais as he painted his drowning Ophelia in 1852. It was just one extraordinary incident in Siddal's short life - she died aged 32 - which features in a new play that premieres in London this month. "We were genuinely surprised that no-one had done it [on stage] before, because it seems like such a gift of a story," says actress Emma West, who plays the lead role in Lizzie Siddal. The Siddal story was most recently told on TV in BBC Two's Desperate Romantics in 2009. At the rehearsal space in south London, where the new play is taking shape, all eyes are drawn to the full-size reproduction of the Millais painting propped against the wall - with Ophelia singing as she sinks to a watery grave. The scene, described in Shakespeare's Hamlet, is one of the best-known works of Pre-Raphaelite art and is the most popular postcard sold by the Tate, which has the original in its permanent collection. "It's one of those paintings you can't tire of looking at - it is so vibrant and lifelike," says West. With her red hair and pale complexion, the actress looks uncannily like the tragic figure in the picture. Indeed, she recalls how on the two occasions she has visited the Tate to see the work, complete strangers have asked her to pose in front of it. "The last time it was a couple of Japanese tourists who were quite freaked out [by the resemblance], it seemed to me." So who was Lizzie Siddal? Born in 1829, she was aged around 20 and working in a hat shop when she was "discovered" by artist Walter Deverell. She soon became a favourite model for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - the group of young painters who wanted to revolutionise the Victorian art world. Over a period of several months, she posed for Millais' Ophelia in a bath full of water kept warm by lamps placed underneath. The lamps went out on one occasion and the water turned ice cold, although Siddal did not complain. Millais was so absorbed in his work and did not notice. Siddal fell ill, and her father threatened the artist with legal action until he agreed to pay the medical fees. Siddal also became an artist in her own right, although painting was an unusual career for a woman in those days. She became the muse of the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and appeared in many of his works. After a long and turbulent engagement, they married in 1860, but a year afterwards Siddal had a stillborn daughter. Suffering depression and addicted to laudanum, Siddal died in February 1862. "The more you read about her the more fascinating she becomes," says playwright Jeremy Green. "Here's a woman who, with no advantages, became famous as a model; but that wasn't sufficient, she wanted to produce art and, falling in love, she wanted to be fulfilled in her love - and in pursuit of both she met tragic consequences. "It's a play about love and death and immortality." The idea for the play, directed by Lotte Wakeham, goes back two years when Green wrote a short film, Ophelia, about the Millais "bathtub" incident. Emma West, who played Siddal in the film too, got a taste of what the Victorian model went through in Millais' studio. "I had the experience of lying in the bath - the longest I did was five or six hours," she recalls. "That's a helpful thing to have done, despite the fact that my fingers were prune-like. The crew were scooping cold water out and pouring in hot water so I was fine." West adds: "It's tempting to think, 'How cruel of Millais', but actually there was nothing to stop Lizzie saying, 'It's getting a bit cold now'. But she didn't. "She chose to try and be the perfect model for him. That's a fantastic clue to her psychology, because what made her attractive to these painters is that she did have a sense of understanding of what they were trying to achieve." As well as seeing the Ophelia painting at the Tate, West also visited Lizzie Siddal's grave in the Rossetti family plot in London's Highgate Cemetery. She was told by the cemetery guide that it is a place of pilgrimage for Lizzie Siddal devotees. "It's predominantly men, who get far more emotional than the women do!" What were her emotions standing at the grave? "I feel a sense of responsibility. When I knew we were going to tell her story I felt I should pay my respects in some way, just to say, 'We're taking this seriously and I hope we do you justice.'" West, meanwhile, describes Siddal as "a trailblazer". "She would dress differently and people would mock her sometimes and she didn't care. She was genuinely nourished by the art. "She was the genuine article." Lizzie Siddal is at the Arcola Theatre, London E8, from 20 November - 21 December 2013. </body>

      <title>Little Mix tackle Smash Hits interview questions</title>
      <description>Little Mix answer questions from Smash Hits</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24857918</url>
      <date>1384138213</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70993000/jpg/_70993982_littlemix_624.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>2011's X Factor winners Little Mix have come a long way in a short time. They've sold more than three million records in just over 18 months, and their debut album, DNA, charted at number four in the US - breaking a girl band record set by the Spice Girls. "We just couldn't believe it. I wanted to cry," says singer Perrie Edwards (high notes, engaged to Zayn from One Direction). "Americans just seem to be fascinated by British people in general," adds Jesy Nelson (impressive vibrato, terrifying mane of hair). "Even just the accent. They're fascinated by the way we speak". The quartet, completed by Leigh-Anne Pinnock (former waitress, huge grin) and Jade Thirlwall (quietly-spoken Geordie, constantly stifling yawns), have just released their follow-up album, Salute - a crisp, smart collection of pop songs inspired by the vocal harmonies of Destiny's Child and En Vogue. In honour of their US chart victory, we decided to ask Little Mix the questions Smash Hits magazine once asked the Spice Girls. "Oh my god, that is so fun!" shrieks Perrie. But then, she hasn't seen the questions yet. Leigh-Anne: Of course! Who's not played spin the bottle? But I never done the kiss version. I always wanted to, but I never did. We did the truth or dare one instead. But I always thought, what if they don't want to kiss you? Or what if they've got a weird thing on their lip? You'd have to run. All: Eurgh! Jade: [adopts unnatural yoga pose] Oh my God, I can! I'm really happy about that. I'd never do it, though. I'd get some sort of fungal infection in my mouth. Perrie: Geki oko punpun maru! It just means that I'm cross with you, but in a cute way, in Japanese. You know how in Japanese everything's cute? Kawaii! So when you're angry with someone, you just have to be cute! Leigh-Anne: I like Yabai! That just rolls off the tongue. It means sick, wicked in Japanese. Jesy: When I was younger, there was a guy and he was really good at skateboarding. So I got on a skateboard and thought that I could do it, and went flying down the hill and broke me arm in front of him. Leigh-Anne: Oooof. Jade: Did you cry in front of him? Jesy: Yeah it was horrible. I was so uncool. I thought he would love a little skater chick. Perrie: I wear boy's clothes. I wear Zayn's clothes but that's about it. I literally have a clearout every two months and I give all my clothes away to my little cousins and stuff. And they just buzz off it. If I was younger, and my cousin or sister was in Little Mix, and they gave me all their hand-me-downs, I'd be the happiest girl in the world. After your X Factor performance, someone wrote on YouTube: "This is the true amount of skin that should be shown, not like other artists, who are pretty much naked". Leigh-Anne: That's good. Perrie: It's a compliment. We don't want to gyrate on the floor with no clothes on, but we do want to look sexy. We're 20-odd years old, so we want to look nice and pretty and cool, but we do it in a way that's more mature. Jesy: Move is about not taking yourself too seriously, just letting yourself be free and having a good old boogie-woogie on the dancefloor, and not being too cool for school. Perrie: Which is what Little Mix are all about. Are you always the first on the floor? Perrie: First on the dancefloor and the last to leave. What's the one song that'll get you up? Leigh-Anne: Diamonds. Oh my God, I feel like I'm Rihanna when I'm dancing to that. Jade: What's that song "duh, duh, d-duh, d-duh, My heart beats like a drum, boom boom, boom boom?" [she means Kelly Marie's Feels Like I'm In Love, fact fans]. Perrie: It has a military feel all the way through. Is it true you had less time to record it than your debut? All:Yes! Perrie: We had plenty of time to write it, but 12 days to actually record all the vocals. Leigh-Anne: It was a gruelling process but do you know what? We got through it. So what's the process? Jade: So, we'll write the song with the beat and the production and stuff. Then once we've got a solid song it'll be like a demo - it might have our vocals on, it might have someone that we're writing with on it. Then we'll go back in and perfect it. Can you ever see yourselves producing your own album? All: Wow. Oh my God. Jade: I'd love to but, I mean, it's all on computers and that. Leigh-Anne: I can just about press play and pause. Jesy: We come up with so many ideas and sounds. That we can do. But I don't know about actually putting it together on the actual computer. Perrie: We don't miss a trick, though. Our label will come to us with a finished song and it'll be a different production, and we'll be like, 'what have you done! That drum beat's different, and what's that horn doing there?' And they'll be like, 'gosh, you literally don't miss anything.' Leigh-Anne: And that's why we've produced such an amazing album. Jesy: The path of what? Lead to what? I think it's asking whether you can discover things about yourself by over-indulging. Jesy: So can I learn from my mistakes? Yes, definitely, of course I do. What's the worst mistake you've made that's taught you a lesson? Perrie: Do you know what it is, right? When we do interviews and we get asked the same questions over and over, I'm like, 'I wish we'd get asked something different'. But when we do, I have no idea. I'm not prepared. Because it's hard to remember your own life! Jesy: Did she really? Did she say she was younger? Of course! You never make your showbiz age older. Perrie: People do lie about that, though, don't they?. Remember that girl on the X Factor ages ago? She auditioned, she got all the way through, but she couldn't do it because she was 16 and the age limit was still 18. Do you still get ID'd when you buy alcohol? Jesy: Oh, all the time. But surely people know who you are? Jade: I think they ask just to make sure it's you. Perrie: I was out with Anthony [Riach - Zayn Malik's best friend] and I went to the counter and the girl said, 'have you got any ID?' Anthony just went, 'Wikipedia her ass'. I was like, 'oh my God!' I would never say that myself, but it was so funny. Leigh-Anne: This is why I don't take ID to clubs - just in case they ask for it, then I can go, 'search me on Google, man'. Perrie: Well, we get a lot of fan mail and it gets sent to the office - so we never see it for ages, and then we have one day of going through it all. And it is mental. But our fans are absolutely incredible. Some of the gifts they send us, and the letters, everything is so amazing. We try and reply to as many fans as we can, especially on Twitter. That's the big difference between you and the Spice Girls. Back then, the only way a fan could get in contact was by sending a letter. But you seem to spend half your lives doing webchats and social networking. Jesy: We have to get the fans involved. They need to feel like they're a part of our journey. That's why they love us so much - they just relate to us. You always come across like regular people - but I note that two of you are wearing sunglasses indoors… Perrie: Only because we look ROUGH. Jesy: Yeah, we're very tired. Jade: I think people end up looking older when they get all that work done. Jesy: Some people have had Botox and they're so young. I just think 'why are you doing it?' Perrie: But we don't know how we're going to feel when we're 40. Jesy: Whatever makes you happy. If it makes you feel better about yourself, then I'm all for it. Perrie: Do you know you can get stuff in your feet? You get Botox put in the bottom of your feet, so when you go on nights out, your feet don't hurt. Do you know how weird that is? Leigh-Anne: But you see Botox? They don't really know the long-term effects of it. That's what scares me. I'm not sure I'd ever want to put botulism in my body. Leigh-Anne: Sorry, what is botulism? It's a toxin you can get from eating undercooked or diseased meat. It basically causes paralysis - and they use a sort of sterilised version of it in Botox injections. Leigh-Anne:WHAT? Does it, like, wear off? Yes, eventually. Leigh-Anne: That's mad. I couldn't do that to myself. And that concludes your lessons for the day! Perrie: Thank you! You're like a science teacher! Little Mix's album, Salute, is out now on Sony / Syco Records. </body>

      <title>John Lewis's Christmas ad: 10 interpretations</title>
      <description>Ten interpretations of the new John Lewis ad</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24901114</url>
      <date>1384193160</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71043000/jpg/_71043574_ad-small.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>John Lewis's Christmas advert is now one of the most discussed parts of the festive run-up. But what does this year's offering mean? The 2013 ad is an animated tale of a hare battling to ensure a bear doesn't miss out on the festivities accompanied by Lily Allen singing Keane's Somewhere Only We Know. While the bear is asleep, the hare sneaks back to his cave and deposits a small package wrapped in red paper and tied up with a green bow. "The store's animation, using old-fashioned line drawing (by artists who worked on The Lion King), features a rather grumpy brown bear and his friend, a hare, who looks - with his doleful eyes - as if he has jumped straight out of Watership Down to escape the bulldozers." says the Telegraph's Harry Wallop. BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips goes one step further. Alongside the headline "The John Lewis Christmas Ad: Alternate Ending" he links to a YouTube video simply entitled Watership Down Violence. He apologises swiftly after. James Murphy, the chief executive of Adam and Eve DDB - the agency which made the advert - reveals the agency was aware of the similarity early on. When he showed an early edit to his wife, she was crying "within ten seconds". "She said the hare reminded her of the rabbit character" in Watership Down. John Lewis "has again eschewed celebrities in favour of trying to make you cry", observes Wallop. The marketing news site The Drum says John Lewis is "seeking to tug on the heart strings". While it has touched some, it hasn't made everyone cry, notes Brand Republic. "Some 80% of the tweets praised the ad, describing it as 'cute' and 'sweet', while 5% of tweeters claimed the ad had reduced them to tears." One tweeter who did admit to crying was Loren Saunders who tweeted "I well up at the John Lewis advert everytime," "Part of its ambition, in the words of Craig Inglis, its marketing director, is to 'connect emotionally with our customers'," Wallop suggests. "The bear has never experienced Christmas because he spends all winter hibernating in a cave, we learn. This makes the hare even sadder, but he gives the sleeping bear a present in the hope he might be roused from his slumber and join in the woodland fun. Since the gift is an alarm clock, his ruse works." Murphy says his advertising agency inherited the same brief that the previous agency had "which is to talk about what we call thoughtful gifting. "There is a unifying theme. If you want to find a gift for someone you love that they would love then come to John Lewis." "The real star this year is the song," says Wallop. He calls the folksy style Allen adopts as "John Lewis's trademark tug-at-the-heartstrings style". Wallop thinks she's made a canny move. "She is in little doubt that it is a sensible 'way of stepping back into the marketplace' after three years away to have children". Campaign Magazine's Ben Bold says it's "the biggest advertising event of the year". Wallop cites research from market analysts at Nielsen which claims retailers will spend about £390m on advertising over the last three months of 2013. John Lewis alone is spending £7 million on its Christmas campaign. "This is a remarkable turn of events. Only a few years ago, it was predicted that TV advertising would slowly die, as we all started to watch programmes on catch-up boxes, such as Sky Plus, or on tablet computers." The Sun says X Factor viewers "branded the ad breaks better than the show itself". But the ad appears to miss out one vital component - the products they are trying to sell. "Not entirely sure how this helps sell Le Creuset casserole dishes", BuzzFeed's Tom Phillips muses. But from the 2011 ad onward the ads don't feature specific John Lewis products. Marketing Week's Sarah Vizard told the Guardian the retailer may appear to be trying not to be a retailer. John Lewis's marketing director Craig Inglis explains in the Guardian: "This is really about telling a story and making that emotional connection. It's not all about glitz and glamour, it's all about animation and the brand." If you watch the ad on YouTube and click on "follow the story" you're directed to a page where you can buy the Lily Allen's single, the bear, the hare and Christmas cards of the bear and the hare among other products related to the advert. When things get this subtle, customers can get confused. Marketing Magazine reports that the teaser to the advert, aired the previous week, confused some people into thinking about Coca Cola. "ITV viewers got a sneak preview of John Lewis' Christmas ad last night when a teaser aired with the hashtag #sleepingbear, although some viewers believe Coca-Cola was behind the ad." All this leaves one question unanswered for Capital FM's Anna Tyler: "How can a hare wrap a present?" Beauty blogger Miss Candy points out: "Chinese people think buying someone a clock is extremely bad luck". Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Amateur film-maker turned media boss</title>
      <description>How video channel SBTV made one 23-year-old a multimillionaire</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801980</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70992000/jpg/_70992386_jamal1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>From a teenager on a council estate in west London to self-made multimillionaire, Jamal Edwards hasn't done too badly for himself in a very short space of time. Still just 23 years old, the amateur film-maker turned media boss is worth more than £8m, and counts famous entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson as one of his friends. Jamal is the owner of SBTV, a broadcasting company that makes videos - typically music videos featuring rap and pop music stars - and puts them up on YouTube. Attracting millions of hits, the business continues to make a fortune by taking a percentage of YouTube's advertising revenues for adverts that are linked to its videos. It is not a bad living for a young man who got into film-making after his parents gave him a basic video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15, and someone who by his own admission has no formal training. Jamal says it is just a question of believing in yourself, and finding your talent, which for him is making videos. "Try anything, don't be scared of failure, that is my advice," he says. "The only failure is not trying. And when you find your niche, what you are really good at, hit it so hard." Back when Jamal was 15, he says he and his video camera immediately became inseparable, and he started to film friends rapping or singing. Not instantly aware of the commercial potential of what he was doing, Jamal says he started to upload the videos to YouTube simply to make it easier for his extended friends to see them. "You can say my videos had mixed reviews to begin with, some people didn't get them, but others thought they were sick [good]," he says. "So I started to put them up on YouTube so everyone could see them, and it just grew from there." Leaving school and getting a job in clothing company Topman, Jamal continued to make videos avidly in his spare time. Building up a reputation for the quality of his work, he would film up-and-coming rappers and singers, while also targeting more established stars outside nightclubs, hotels and dance music radio station Kiss 100. As word of mouth spread, his videos on YouTube, put up under the name SBTV (the SB stands for SmokeyBarz, Jamal's own rapping nickname) started to get hundreds of thousands of hits, predominantly from 13- to 30-year-olds. And so Jamal contacted YouTube to see if he was eligible for a share of advertising revenues. YouTube, owned by internet search engine giant, Google, turned him down three times, but Jamal persisted. YouTube ultimately agreed after he was able to prove that all the videos he was uploading were original content that he had made himself. "My first YouTube cheque was for a couple of hundred pounds. So I said, 'Look mum, I have earned money from YouTube.' "But my parents were like, 'That's not sustainable income, that's not steady.' But the cheques have just got bigger and bigger. The more effort I put in, the more views the videos get, and the more advertising revenues I get back." Soon Jamal was able to quit Topman and run SBTV on a full-time basis. Today he has 12 members of staff, and SBTV also has its own website that carries news stories and feature articles in addition to the videos. The business has further branched out into its own clothing line, as Jamal says he is always thinking of ways to expand. And while the grime dance music scene remains a core focus, SBTV has also moved into other musical genres. An SBTV video of singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has had 7.7 million hits on YouTube. Jamal says he is now set on conquering the US, and further expanding the video content to cover comedy, sport and fashion. Regarding his interest in the latter, he was seen in the front row at September's London Fashion Week. Jamal has also this year published a self-help e-book called Self Belief: The Vision. The business so impressed Sir Richard Branson that last year Jamal won a best new start-up award from Virgin Media. And the two have stayed in touch ever since. Others who have seen SBTV's potential include technology and music investment specialists Miroma Ventures, which last month bought a share in the business for an undisclosed sum. Jamal was also chosen to become an ambassador for the Prince's Trust, the youth charity run by Prince Charles which supports young people setting up their own companies. After such meteoric growth, Jamal says he often has to remind himself to slow down. "I still get bad anxiety at times, if I have too many things going on. I have to sit down and tell myself to take a breather," he says. "I think this is one of the most important things for any entrepreneur to remember - that you can't go 100% all of the time. "I have crashed and burned about three times over the years because I was just working, working, working. Now I'm more planned, more organised." But has becoming a multimillionaire changed him? "Honestly no, I come from a humble background, I'm from a council estate. It is nice to be comfortable, and be able to buy things for friends and family, but I'm not motivated by the money. "I don't want to be treated any different, I'm still the same person, I'm well grounded. And if I wasn't, my friends and family would soon knock me down to size." </body>

      <body>Before his death at the age of 30, photographer Tony Ray-Jones spent the latter half of the 1960s travelling across England trying to capture a disappearing way of life. His distinctive take on English eccentricity had a profound influence on a young photography student at the time - Martin Parr - who, himself, would go on to have a distinguished career behind the lens. Martin Parr has selected dozens of Tony Ray-Jones' images to be shown at the Science Museum in London, alongside some of his own rarely seen images from the 1970s. Here, take a few minutes to look back at a bygone era. Only in England: Photographs by Tony Ray-Jones and Martin Parr can be seen at the Science Museum, London, until 16 March 2014.

      <description>Loneliness and laughs on the set of Gravity</description>

      <body>With two acting heavyweights floating effortlessly in space, and near-perfect reviews, is Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is reaching for the stars this award season? The film, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as two astronauts adrift in space after a terrifying accident was, Clooney says, " an excuse for Sandy and me to finally work together". "She won't let me say exactly how long we have known each other for, but it's definitely for more than 20 years. "We are like brother and sister. We never found the right vehicle before but in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron, we knew we had found a masterpiece. However, this is Sandy's film, not mine. It's her on screen most of the time." Co-written by Cuaron, who was behind 2005's Children of Men, as well as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it took more than $80m (£49.7m) and four years to make, because, the director confesses "we miscalculated it". "The technology to create all these special effects didn't exist, so we had to invent it. That's why we took so long." Oscar-winner Bullock, 49, plays Dr Ryan Stone, a woman who has lost her only child, a four-year-old daughter. Gravity is the story of whether Stone can make it back to earth or not, but Bullock claims that it's insignificant as to whether the hero of the film is male or female. "Having gone through this, I can tell you that it would be hard enough to make this film with either a man or a woman in the lead character, that the things they struggle against would flatten any human being. "Yes, it's different to other action movies in that she happens to be female, but not by a lot. I discussed this with Alfonso, that I wanted her, in her grief, to have removed everything she possibly could that would remind her of being feminine. Her outward appearance is just perfunctory." Cuaron though, adds that he resisted executive pressure to change the gender of the story and make the hero into a man, saying that "I always wanted a woman in the lead. It was always going to be a survival story, but I didn't want a tale of macho heroism. "I wanted this woman's life force as a mother, a woman who had adversities in her life, but with the possibility of rebirth. Ultimately, I wanted a film with female energy." With a three-year-old adopted son, Louis, Bullock says it was "horrible" to play the character of Stone, "just because my whole world revolves around my own little boy, so to go to work and imagine for three months that my child no longer existed wasn't the best place to put myself. "I don't think there is a greater loss than that of a child and yet men and women lose them every day and somehow find the strength to go on living - or not, as the case may be. "But this is what really spoke to me about this film, more than any of the action set-pieces. It's all about death and rebirth. It made me ask the question of myself: What gives us the reason to get up and live? Because if you have lived any kind of life, you will have been hit with things that are incredibly painful, as I have. "You ask yourself why, but sometimes there is no why, no reason, no answer. And so everyone has to ask themselves the question: What gives you the reason to stand up and prevail in life? And if you don't have one, as my character doesn't, can you get up and find a reason?" After premiering at both the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals, Gravity has received a 97% approval rating on review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes - one of its highest scores ever for a film. Time Out calls it "one of the most awe-inspiring achievements in the history of special effects cinema", but according to Bullock, "most of it was just acting in front of nothing". Rather than put the actress in a "vomit comet" (a plane that follows a parabolic flight path to simulate zero gravity), Cuaron employed a huge "light box" to create the effect of floating in space. Standing 20-feet tall and 10-foot across, the box was covered in more than 800,000 LED bulbs, allowing the director to project lights, colours and backdrops around his star, who was often harnessed into a custom 12-wire rig, operated by the puppeteers who created the title character in the National Theatre's production of War Horse. "It was so lonely most of the time, as it was just me, with no human contact apart from Alfonso's voice in my earpiece," recalls Bullock. "But I channelled that loneliness and all that frustration from making the apparatus I was trying to float on work. I really struggled with that and learning how to contort my body into the right positions." Clooney adds that, "physically even just wearing the astronaut suit is exhausting and uncomfortable, so it helped that Sandy and I could laugh a lot during the hour or so while they would re-set the shot. "We had to use a lot of wires, but the main thing required of us was to stand still while a [camera] the size of a truck would fly through mid-air at us, stop just short of our faces, and we had to pretend that we didn't see it coming. That was the most difficult thing about this kind of shoot." Gravity is expected to lead in both technical and creative categories in the upcoming award season, but Bullock says it was the experience of filming it that has been more valuable to Cuaron and his two actors. "It was such a difficult shoot, but the end result was worth it, and we haven't done it to get awards. I'm not sure why I put myself through it, apart from to hear George's jokes in between takes. "To me, I'll remember hanging on wires, in the middle of nothing, in a really awkward position. That's when I think to myself, 'oh my God - my job is so weird.'" Gravity is released in the UK on November 8, 2013 </body>
